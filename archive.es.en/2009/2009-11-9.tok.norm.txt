activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de renewables -pipe- 09.11.2009 munich embraces ambitious strategies to convert to green energy by 2025 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heat converters are part of an innovative geothermal plant in munich the size and complexity of large cities often leads to difficulties in switching to renewable energies .
munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .

these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .
it is lined with minefields , barbed wire and heavy armaments , and patrolled by a million soldiers .
there are two main crossing points , but they are rarely used .
communication between the two sides is minimal , with virtually no mail or telephone links between the sides .
could korea become the next germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once unimaginable for germany .
could korea follow suit ?
but with celebrations underway in berlin to mark the momentous events of 1989 , south korean commentators have been talking about the possibility of the collapse of the single remaining cold war frontier .
an editorial in the korea herald newspaper said " just as the fall of the berlin wall took the west germans off guard , so may the collapse of the border fences come as a surprised to the south koreans . "
recent polls suggest that some sixty percent of south koreans favor unification with the north , but many add that they would be concerned about the financial implications .
and those would be massive .
south koreas gross national income is believed to be 38 times that of its northern counterpart .
analysts believe it would cost more than one trillion dollars for the south to absorb the north , which would be the only feasible scenario were the two sides to unite. tkw / reuters / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .
it is lined with minefields , barbed wire and heavy armaments , and patrolled by a million soldiers .
there are two main crossing points , but they are rarely used .
communication between the two sides is minimal , with virtually no mail or telephone links between the sides .
could korea become the next germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once unimaginable for germany .
could korea follow suit ?
but with celebrations underway in berlin to mark the momentous events of 1989 , south korean commentators have been talking about the possibility of the collapse of the single remaining cold war frontier .
an editorial in the korea herald newspaper said " just as the fall of the berlin wall took the west germans off guard , so may the collapse of the border fences come as a surprised to the south koreans . "
recent polls suggest that some sixty percent of south koreans favor unification with the north , but many add that they would be concerned about the financial implications .
and those would be massive .
south koreas gross national income is believed to be 38 times that of its northern counterpart .
analysts believe it would cost more than one trillion dollars for the south to absorb the north , which would be the only feasible scenario were the two sides to unite. tkw / reuters / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2009 bayern munich censor critical defender lahm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm is key to the defense of bayern and the national team the management of german soccer giants bayern munich has slapped a record fine on german national player philipp lahm after he spoke what some describe as uncomfortable truths . bayern munich handed german national defender philipp lahm an undisclosed record fine on sunday for what the club termed " disciplinary violations . "
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .

the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .

they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow .

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .

" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .

there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2009 bayern munich censor critical defender lahm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm is key to the defense of bayern and the national team the management of german soccer giants bayern munich has slapped a record fine on german national player philipp lahm after he spoke what some describe as uncomfortable truths . bayern munich handed german national defender philipp lahm an undisclosed record fine on sunday for what the club termed " disciplinary violations . "
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .

they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

in 2006 , 55 soldiers were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , or ptsd .
by 2008 , the figure had risen to 226 .
but the problem is not limited to the german army .
german society will also have to deal with the returnees from afghanistan . many soldiers report that afghanistan opened them up to a whole new world .
what they confronted there was different from what they had been prepared for , they say .
they can not forget the impressions from the areas in which they are deployed : bombed-out buildings , rubble , children wearing rags .
heinz fischer , a sergeant major who has survived four spells in afghanistan , staying there for four to six months at a stretch , says that the soldiers are most taken aback by the poverty and sheer misery .
moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .
or there are people in the fields , working , they will wave and then bend over and come up with an anti-tank missile .
i ’ ve seen that before . "
such scenes leave their mark .
images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .
he adds that the feelings of guilt are exacerbated by the negative attitude to the war in german society .
there are currently 3,400 german troops in afghanistan .
the new government has said it will not increase the numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.11.2009 20 years later , east germany 's vietnamese have moved on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were tens of thousands of vietnamese " contract workers " in east german factories 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall not much has survived in eastern germany to remind people of decades of communist rule .
an aspect of public life that is still distinctly different in eastern germany though , is the seemingly omnipresence of vietnamese people there .
once invited in their thousands by the communist rulers to shore up the country ’ s flagging economy they were forced to start new lives in the shadow of german unification .
and they have survived through hard work and perseverance . in the sprawling halls of berlin ’ s pacific centre wholesale outlet , 38-year-old trinh thi mui is very much in her element .
as she rattles through impressive numbers about her aquisition such as the 17,000 square meters shopping space , a four-storey office building and almost 50 trading companies from across asia represented there – the vietnamese businesswoman seems to grow in stature .
dressed in an elegant business outfit she lectures stunned visitors about labor costs in vietnam and why textile manufacturers there know better about germans ‘ clothing sizes and favourite colours than their rivals from china do .
yet , some 20 years ago , ms mui was in a different line of work .
she used to hunch over electric motors at an assembly line in an east berlin company , one of about 60,000 vietnamese contract workers hired by communist east germany to meet a growing demand for cheap labour in the country ’ s antiquated industries .
" the wages were rather low in east germany , " she recalls .
" but we needed the money to help our families in vietnam .
nevertheless we had a lot of fun at the weekends which used to be free .
we also made friends with many of our german colleagues who were dancing and eating with us at parties organised by the company . "
a new beginning in 1989 when communism collapsed and germany was unified , thousands of companies folded and the foreign workers were the first to lose their jobs .
some 30,000 vietnamese were sent home straight away .
those whose contracts had not yet expired were allowed to stay on .
like trinh thi mui they were trying to carve out a living in the shadows of all the western abundance that began to flow into east germany .
" after unification my husband and i set up a small textile business " , mui says .
" initially we bought our wares from poland , india and pakistan .
later we started doing business with vietnam where textiles are cheaper and the industry was growing .
after spending 15 years in a bus selling our wares at markets across germany , we entered the wholesale business and opened this centre . "
many germans , though , still associate the vietnamese with possessing a rather shadowy type of character – the type that springs to mind is the sulking and suspicious-looking cigarette pedlar hawking his illegally imported wares outside supermarkets .
many of them used to toil away in the communist factories of eastern europe and the former soviet union .
when the iron curtain fell they sought asylum in a unified germany .
vietnam refused to take them back , so an estimated 10,000 were left stranded here and were merely granted an exceptional leave to remain .
some of them ended up in the services of the vietnamese cigarette mafia – an organisation whose gang warfare in the 1990s has left a bitter aftertaste for many germans .
hai bluhm , a social worker at the song hong vietnam contract workers ‘ association in potsdam is keen to improve her people ’ s image .
the 40-year-old earned an economics degree in east germany and was then made redundant soon after unification .
today she gives lectures about german business and trade laws , and advises her fellow nationals on germany ’ s intricate immigration laws .
" if you can prove that you 're making a living " , she says , " everything is fine in this country .
" i ’ ve learned a lot of good things from the germans .
punctuality is one of these , and that the human being should be at the centre of everything .
the individual human being is important here , unlike in vietnam where the individual does not always matter . "
successful immigrants these days former vietnamese contract workers successfully run textile businesses and asian food restaurants - and lately nail studios have become all the rage within the community .
small wonder then that a recent immigration study has found the vietnamese to be one of the best-integrated group of immigrants in germany .
and franziska woellert , co author of the study , says the second generation of vietnamese in germany want to aim even higher than their parents .
" they have a high level of education and perform well in the labour market .
there are engineers , and many are self-employed .
education is something that vietnamese children know they have to be successful at . "
some 20 years after they had fallen on hard times , most of the former contract workers from vietnam appear to have left the troubled times of communist east germany behind them and have moved on to a more prosperous future .

in 2006 , 55 soldiers were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , or ptsd .
by 2008 , the figure had risen to 226 .
but the problem is not limited to the german army .
german society will also have to deal with the returnees from afghanistan . many soldiers report that afghanistan opened them up to a whole new world .

they can not forget the impressions from the areas in which they are deployed : bombed-out buildings , rubble , children wearing rags .
heinz fischer , a sergeant major who has survived four spells in afghanistan , staying there for four to six months at a stretch , says that the soldiers are most taken aback by the poverty and sheer misery .
moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .

images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .
he adds that the feelings of guilt are exacerbated by the negative attitude to the war in german society .
there are currently 3,400 german troops in afghanistan .
the new government has said it will not increase the numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.11.2009 20 years later , east germany 's vietnamese have moved on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were tens of thousands of vietnamese " contract workers " in east german factories 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall not much has survived in eastern germany to remind people of decades of communist rule .
an aspect of public life that is still distinctly different in eastern germany though , is the seemingly omnipresence of vietnamese people there .
once invited in their thousands by the communist rulers to shore up the country ’ s flagging economy they were forced to start new lives in the shadow of german unification .
and they have survived through hard work and perseverance . in the sprawling halls of berlin ’ s pacific centre wholesale outlet , 38-year-old trinh thi mui is very much in her element .
as she rattles through impressive numbers about her aquisition such as the 17,000 square meters shopping space , a four-storey office building and almost 50 trading companies from across asia represented there – the vietnamese businesswoman seems to grow in stature .
dressed in an elegant business outfit she lectures stunned visitors about labor costs in vietnam and why textile manufacturers there know better about germans ‘ clothing sizes and favourite colours than their rivals from china do .
yet , some 20 years ago , ms mui was in a different line of work .
she used to hunch over electric motors at an assembly line in an east berlin company , one of about 60,000 vietnamese contract workers hired by communist east germany to meet a growing demand for cheap labour in the country ’ s antiquated industries .
" the wages were rather low in east germany , " she recalls .
" but we needed the money to help our families in vietnam .
nevertheless we had a lot of fun at the weekends which used to be free .
we also made friends with many of our german colleagues who were dancing and eating with us at parties organised by the company . "
a new beginning in 1989 when communism collapsed and germany was unified , thousands of companies folded and the foreign workers were the first to lose their jobs .
some 30,000 vietnamese were sent home straight away .
those whose contracts had not yet expired were allowed to stay on .
like trinh thi mui they were trying to carve out a living in the shadows of all the western abundance that began to flow into east germany .
" after unification my husband and i set up a small textile business " , mui says .
" initially we bought our wares from poland , india and pakistan .
later we started doing business with vietnam where textiles are cheaper and the industry was growing .
after spending 15 years in a bus selling our wares at markets across germany , we entered the wholesale business and opened this centre . "
many germans , though , still associate the vietnamese with possessing a rather shadowy type of character – the type that springs to mind is the sulking and suspicious-looking cigarette pedlar hawking his illegally imported wares outside supermarkets .
many of them used to toil away in the communist factories of eastern europe and the former soviet union .
when the iron curtain fell they sought asylum in a unified germany .
vietnam refused to take them back , so an estimated 10,000 were left stranded here and were merely granted an exceptional leave to remain .
some of them ended up in the services of the vietnamese cigarette mafia – an organisation whose gang warfare in the 1990s has left a bitter aftertaste for many germans .
hai bluhm , a social worker at the song hong vietnam contract workers ‘ association in potsdam is keen to improve her people ’ s image .
the 40-year-old earned an economics degree in east germany and was then made redundant soon after unification .
today she gives lectures about german business and trade laws , and advises her fellow nationals on germany ’ s intricate immigration laws .
" if you can prove that you 're making a living " , she says , " everything is fine in this country .
" i ’ ve learned a lot of good things from the germans .
punctuality is one of these , and that the human being should be at the centre of everything .
the individual human being is important here , unlike in vietnam where the individual does not always matter . "
successful immigrants these days former vietnamese contract workers successfully run textile businesses and asian food restaurants - and lately nail studios have become all the rage within the community .
small wonder then that a recent immigration study has found the vietnamese to be one of the best-integrated group of immigrants in germany .
and franziska woellert , co author of the study , says the second generation of vietnamese in germany want to aim even higher than their parents .
" they have a high level of education and perform well in the labour market .
there are engineers , and many are self-employed .
education is something that vietnamese children know they have to be successful at . "
some 20 years after they had fallen on hard times , most of the former contract workers from vietnam appear to have left the troubled times of communist east germany behind them and have moved on to a more prosperous future .

in 2006 , 55 soldiers were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , or ptsd .
by 2008 , the figure had risen to 226 .
but the problem is not limited to the german army .
german society will also have to deal with the returnees from afghanistan . many soldiers report that afghanistan opened them up to a whole new world .
what they confronted there was different from what they had been prepared for , they say .
they can not forget the impressions from the areas in which they are deployed : bombed-out buildings , rubble , children wearing rags .
heinz fischer , a sergeant major who has survived four spells in afghanistan , staying there for four to six months at a stretch , says that the soldiers are most taken aback by the poverty and sheer misery .
moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .
or there are people in the fields , working , they will wave and then bend over and come up with an anti-tank missile .
i ’ ve seen that before . "
such scenes leave their mark .
images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .
he adds that the feelings of guilt are exacerbated by the negative attitude to the war in german society .
there are currently 3,400 german troops in afghanistan .
the new government has said it will not increase the numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2009 opinion : november 9th was germany 's - and the world 's - lucky day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people should celebrate reunification , not critique it while germany is busy celebrating twenty years as a unified country , some are critical of the reunification process .
but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .

they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow .

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 09.11.2009 opinion : november 9th was germany 's - and the world 's - lucky day großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people should celebrate reunification , not critique it while germany is busy celebrating twenty years as a unified country , some are critical of the reunification process .
but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 09.11.2009 bayern munich censor critical defender lahm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm is key to the defense of bayern and the national team the management of german soccer giants bayern munich has slapped a record fine on german national player philipp lahm after he spoke what some describe as uncomfortable truths . bayern munich handed german national defender philipp lahm an undisclosed record fine on sunday for what the club termed " disciplinary violations . "
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .

" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .
" these figures are pretty good .
up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .
it is lined with minefields , barbed wire and heavy armaments , and patrolled by a million soldiers .
there are two main crossing points , but they are rarely used .
communication between the two sides is minimal , with virtually no mail or telephone links between the sides .

but with celebrations underway in berlin to mark the momentous events of 1989 , south korean commentators have been talking about the possibility of the collapse of the single remaining cold war frontier .
an editorial in the korea herald newspaper said " just as the fall of the berlin wall took the west germans off guard , so may the collapse of the border fences come as a surprised to the south koreans . "
recent polls suggest that some sixty percent of south koreans favor unification with the north , but many add that they would be concerned about the financial implications .
and those would be massive .
south koreas gross national income is believed to be 38 times that of its northern counterpart .
analysts believe it would cost more than one trillion dollars for the south to absorb the north , which would be the only feasible scenario were the two sides to unite. tkw / reuters / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wiesbaden-based office valued september exports at 70 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- with imports reaching some 59 billion , constituting a 3.8 percent and 5.8 percent increase respectively .
the new data came as a welcome surprise to analysts who had forecast no more than 2.5 percent growth for september .

up until august , data in other eurozone countries was mixed , but now the recovery is gathering speed .
exports in other european countries should also pick up now , " giada giani of citigroup told reuters news agency .
however , although the new figures point to light at the end of the tunnel , exports were in fact down 18.8 percent compared to the same month last year , illustrating how hard germany 's export-dependent economy was hit by the global financial and economic crisis. nk / reuters / dpa editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .
or there are people in the fields , working , they will wave and then bend over and come up with an anti-tank missile .
i ’ ve seen that before . "
such scenes leave their mark .
images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .
he adds that the feelings of guilt are exacerbated by the negative attitude to the war in german society .
there are currently 3,400 german troops in afghanistan .
the new government has said it will not increase the numbers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 09.11.2009 20 years later , east germany 's vietnamese have moved on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there were tens of thousands of vietnamese " contract workers " in east german factories 20 years after the fall of the berlin wall not much has survived in eastern germany to remind people of decades of communist rule .
an aspect of public life that is still distinctly different in eastern germany though , is the seemingly omnipresence of vietnamese people there .
once invited in their thousands by the communist rulers to shore up the country ’ s flagging economy they were forced to start new lives in the shadow of german unification .
and they have survived through hard work and perseverance . in the sprawling halls of berlin ’ s pacific centre wholesale outlet , 38-year-old trinh thi mui is very much in her element .
as she rattles through impressive numbers about her aquisition such as the 17,000 square meters shopping space , a four-storey office building and almost 50 trading companies from across asia represented there – the vietnamese businesswoman seems to grow in stature .
dressed in an elegant business outfit she lectures stunned visitors about labor costs in vietnam and why textile manufacturers there know better about germans ‘ clothing sizes and favourite colours than their rivals from china do .
yet , some 20 years ago , ms mui was in a different line of work .
she used to hunch over electric motors at an assembly line in an east berlin company , one of about 60,000 vietnamese contract workers hired by communist east germany to meet a growing demand for cheap labour in the country ’ s antiquated industries .
" the wages were rather low in east germany , " she recalls .
" but we needed the money to help our families in vietnam .
nevertheless we had a lot of fun at the weekends which used to be free .
we also made friends with many of our german colleagues who were dancing and eating with us at parties organised by the company . "
a new beginning in 1989 when communism collapsed and germany was unified , thousands of companies folded and the foreign workers were the first to lose their jobs .
some 30,000 vietnamese were sent home straight away .
those whose contracts had not yet expired were allowed to stay on .
like trinh thi mui they were trying to carve out a living in the shadows of all the western abundance that began to flow into east germany .
" after unification my husband and i set up a small textile business " , mui says .
" initially we bought our wares from poland , india and pakistan .
later we started doing business with vietnam where textiles are cheaper and the industry was growing .
after spending 15 years in a bus selling our wares at markets across germany , we entered the wholesale business and opened this centre . "
many germans , though , still associate the vietnamese with possessing a rather shadowy type of character – the type that springs to mind is the sulking and suspicious-looking cigarette pedlar hawking his illegally imported wares outside supermarkets .
many of them used to toil away in the communist factories of eastern europe and the former soviet union .
when the iron curtain fell they sought asylum in a unified germany .
vietnam refused to take them back , so an estimated 10,000 were left stranded here and were merely granted an exceptional leave to remain .
some of them ended up in the services of the vietnamese cigarette mafia – an organisation whose gang warfare in the 1990s has left a bitter aftertaste for many germans .
hai bluhm , a social worker at the song hong vietnam contract workers ‘ association in potsdam is keen to improve her people ’ s image .
the 40-year-old earned an economics degree in east germany and was then made redundant soon after unification .
today she gives lectures about german business and trade laws , and advises her fellow nationals on germany ’ s intricate immigration laws .
" if you can prove that you 're making a living " , she says , " everything is fine in this country .
" i ’ ve learned a lot of good things from the germans .
punctuality is one of these , and that the human being should be at the centre of everything .
the individual human being is important here , unlike in vietnam where the individual does not always matter . "
successful immigrants these days former vietnamese contract workers successfully run textile businesses and asian food restaurants - and lately nail studios have become all the rage within the community .
small wonder then that a recent immigration study has found the vietnamese to be one of the best-integrated group of immigrants in germany .
and franziska woellert , co author of the study , says the second generation of vietnamese in germany want to aim even higher than their parents .
" they have a high level of education and perform well in the labour market .
there are engineers , and many are self-employed .
education is something that vietnamese children know they have to be successful at . "
some 20 years after they had fallen on hard times , most of the former contract workers from vietnam appear to have left the troubled times of communist east germany behind them and have moved on to a more prosperous future .

in 2006 , 55 soldiers were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , or ptsd .
by 2008 , the figure had risen to 226 .
but the problem is not limited to the german army .
german society will also have to deal with the returnees from afghanistan . many soldiers report that afghanistan opened them up to a whole new world .
what they confronted there was different from what they had been prepared for , they say .
they can not forget the impressions from the areas in which they are deployed : bombed-out buildings , rubble , children wearing rags .
heinz fischer , a sergeant major who has survived four spells in afghanistan , staying there for four to six months at a stretch , says that the soldiers are most taken aback by the poverty and sheer misery .
moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .
or there are people in the fields , working , they will wave and then bend over and come up with an anti-tank missile .
i ’ ve seen that before . "
such scenes leave their mark .
images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .

german society will also have to deal with the returnees from afghanistan . many soldiers report that afghanistan opened them up to a whole new world .
what they confronted there was different from what they had been prepared for , they say .
they can not forget the impressions from the areas in which they are deployed : bombed-out buildings , rubble , children wearing rags .
heinz fischer , a sergeant major who has survived four spells in afghanistan , staying there for four to six months at a stretch , says that the soldiers are most taken aback by the poverty and sheer misery .
moreover , they are constantly accompanied by fear .
constant fear " you might be going along a road for two kilometres " , says the 44-year-old , " a dirt road with two lanes and then road tankers will be coming from the other direction and any of them can explode .
or there are people in the fields , working , they will wave and then bend over and come up with an anti-tank missile .
i ’ ve seen that before . "
such scenes leave their mark .
images of wounded friends or killed children are hard to forget .
this year , 135 german soldiers have sought psychological advice in military hospitals .
but the number of estimated unreported cases is higher .
soldiers are not always able to open up , to talk about their feelings , says dr peter zimmermann , a senior army doctor .
he heads the psychiatry and psychotherapy department at the military hospital in berlin .
the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .
whether the figures are really increasing is something we want to examine by looking into the unreported cases but the need for treatment is certainly increasing - that much is already clear .
in the coming months and years , we will probably have to ensure that there is more scope for treatment . "
feelings of guilt he thinks it is important to ensure that soldiers can get help when they return to germany .
he is a co-founder of the online anonymous help service " attack on the soul " .
the site is mainly used by younger soldiers .
zimmermann explains that many of them have feelings of guilt that they can not get rid of .
company sergeant major fischer knows what zimmermann is talking about .
" a bomb goes off " , he recalls an incident in afghanistan .
" we ’ re sitting in a tank , thank god , but it hits the civilian population .
you see injured civilians , maybe children as well .
that was often the case in kunduz .
and you ’ re a soldier there and then they tell you that on top of all this , it ’ s happening because you ’ re there .
it ’ s hard to come to terms with that . "
this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .
he adds that the feelings of guilt are exacerbated by the negative attitude to the war in german society .
there are currently 3,400 german troops in afghanistan .
the new government has said it will not increase the numbers .

the 42-year-old explains , " what we ’ re now getting with afghanistan has a different quality in terms of the burden .

this is why it helps to have a strong family environment , says fischer , who is responsible for giving advice and care to soldiers .

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .
bumps on the road naturally , there have been hiccups during these past twenty years of unification .
hasty promises could not be kept .
the shock- therapy-style introduction of a social market economy into the ruins of the former gdr was an extremely painful experience for many people .
but it was the only way forward , because ultimately the east german revolution not only fundamentally changed a country , but a complete world order .
november 9 , 1989 marked the end of a 44-year era which , for all the threat of an international east-west conflict , was also a time of ease .
the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .
and for that reason , it is not only historic foolishness to look back to the olden days with sadness , but also an insult to all those whose activities brought the wall down .
twenty years later , it is undoubtedly too soon for a truly pan-german perception of this event .
perhaps that is why two crucial elements are often missing from the countless memorial ceremonies , commentaries and documentaries : they are the joy and the pride which surrounded this dramatic , once-in-a-lifetime moment that saw people from east and west weeping with emotion and disbelief as they embraced one another , long before the reunification process became the domain of politics and economics .
beacon for the wider world this november 9 , 1989 , which came so unexpectedly , proves still now that even the best thought-out repressionist regime can collapse - and that goes for cuba , iran and north korea .
as such , it is not only a fortunate day for germany .
to finally declare it a national german holiday would not only be of political importance , but would also send the right historical signal .

but dw 's marc koch believes november 9th deserves to be made into a national holiday . it is a day of evocative pictures and touching accounts , and of pathos and platitudes as well .
yet more than anything , november 9th , 1989 , was the most auspicious day in modern german and european history .
not only did it symbolize the end of an ailing and unjust system , and the reunification of a country after 40 years of division , it was also the day on which everyone could experience the long-evoked values of unity , justice and freedom .
a moment of triumph in which society could celebrate itself .
thanks to the citizens of the gdr but twenty years later , it is important to remember that it was neither the west nor politicians who made this day possible .
it was citizens of the gdr who , on the dismal streets of their walled-in state , asked for nothing more than their rights .
the fact that weeks of peaceful protest led to the collapse of the concrete and barbed wire barrier affirms the place of democratic constitutional history , and the values upon which it rests .
and all those who are critical of the state of unified germany - or who rant about the supposed eastern economic collapse , or who waste their right to a free and secret democratic ballot by handing their vote to parties in favor of a return to socialist experiments - should remember that today .

the fact that the world is now more complex , less clear and in need of greater explanation than ever before , is directly related to the fall of the berlin wall .

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .
it is lined with minefields , barbed wire and heavy armaments , and patrolled by a million soldiers .

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

munich has made itself a forerunner among big cities in germany for finding innovative ways to go green by 2025 . by 2015 , munich hopes to supply enough renewable electricity to meet the needs of all private households in the city .
currently , the capital city of the southern german state of bavaria relies on a mix of energy sources including non-renewable electricity generated from coal and nuclear power plants . if the plan succeeds , the city with 1.3 million inhabitants will become the first german city housing a million residents to power its private households entirely with renewable energy . ambitious energy changes by 2025 munich has established a more ambitious goal for 2025 : the city 's electric company swm will produce enough electricity to power not only private homes but also businesses and industrial buildings . munich plans to rely on multiple renewable energies to meet its goal , including solar , water and geothermal power .
the city estimates an investment of 9 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.4 billion -rrb- will be necessary to produce the 7.5 billion kilowatt hours of energy needed by munich homes and businesses . mayor christian ude believes swm can serve as a reliable and financially strong investor in the project .
so far , munich officials have consciously avoided privatizing the city 's electricity supplier , in contrast to other large cities in germany . a pioneer in green energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mayor christian ude supports the city 's green initiatives " a city needs to be in the position financially to institute energy conservation programs , and a city must own utility companies if it wants to engage in energy politics , " said ude , a member of the social democratic party . ude budgets 10 million euros annually to promote energy saving construction and renovation .
munich is also heavily subsidizing a project that aims to build up solar technology in the community . these efforts are part of the city 's long-standing commitment to reducing its dependence on non-renewable energy .
as early as 1997 , munich began operating the largest roof-top solar panel in europe .
the large solar unit spreads across six roofs and has produced 10 million kilowatt hours of energy thus far , which takes care of the energy needs of 4,000 private households . other green energy projects instituted by the city include a wind power unit that has generated 2.3 million kilowatt hours of eco-friendly electricity and a novel geothermal heating plant .
munich 's geothermal plant was the first of its kind in the world , but 55 countries have since adopted models resembling it . from water to geothermal energy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solar panels can be seen lining roofs in munich a cave explorer discovered the energy source that made munich 's geothermal heating plant possible .
the hobbyist explorer noted the existence of underground water stores reaching 90 degrees celsius -lrb- 194 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- located 3,000 meters -lrb- 9,842 feet -rrb- below riem , an area within munich . the geothermal plant works by " pumping the hot water to the surface and transferring it to heat converters , " explained stephan schwarz , the head of maintenance and technology for the city 's utility company that operates the plant .
" afterwards , the cooled water is redistributed to the city ’ s water supply . " since 2004 , the geothermal plant has spared the city 34,000 tons in co2 emissions .
that figure represents ten percent of the co2 emissions generated annually by car traffic in munich . creating a green future officials hope to take the idea a step further with a new plant in sauerlach , a town near munich .
there , underground water sources reach a temperature of 143 degrees celsius and could be used to generate electricity . the limited space available in the bavarian capital , however , sets limits on how much energy the city can generate from renewable sources .
as such , the city has begun investing in large-scale renewable energy plants in other regions .
munich currently has shares in the largest offshore wind park in the north sea and in a solar-thermal power plant in the spanish state of andalusia that will be hooked up to the city ’ s power network in 2011 . the german agency for renewable energy named munich its energy community 2009 in october in light of its contributions to promoting green energy . author : daniel schewschkewitz -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : mark mattox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a 40-year study of 238,000 women found those who were obese at 18 had twice the risk of developing ms compared to women who were slimmer at that age .
yet body size during childhood or adulthood was not found to be associated with ms risk , the us researchers report in neurology .
but an ms charity warned more research was needed to confirm the findings .
our results suggest that weight during adolescence , rather than childhood or adulthood , is critical in determining the risk of ms dr kassandra munger harvard school of public health researchers from harvard school of public health used data from nurses taking part in a large study on diet , lifestyle factors and health .
over the course of the study , 593 women were diagnosed with ms , a condition caused by the loss of nerve fibres and their protective myelin sheath in the brain and spinal cord , which causes neurological damage .
the researchers compared the risk of the disease with body mass index -lrb- bmi -rrb- - a ratio of weight to height - at age 18 .
participants were also asked to describe their body size using a series of diagrams at the age of five , 10 and 20 .
the study showed that those with an " obese " bmi of 30 or larger at age 18 had more than twice the risk of developing ms. there was also a smaller increased risk in those who were classed as overweight .
the results were the same after accounting for smoking status and physical activity level .
body shape when comparing the risk of ms with self-reported body shape , the researchers found no association between childhood obesity and the future chances of developing the disease .
they also found no risk associated with adult obesity .
but women who had a larger body size at 20 years of age also had almost twice the risk of ms compared to women who reported a thinner body size .
previous research has linked high levels of vitamin d with a reduced risk of ms and the researchers point out that obesity is associated with low vitamin d levels in the body .
the researchers suggest fatty tissue produces substances that affect the immune system , which may also provide a link with the chances of developing ms. further research should look at confirming the findings in men and individuals from different ethnic groups as well as comparing with vitamin d levels , they said .
" our results suggest that weight during adolescence , rather than childhood or adulthood , is critical in determining the risk of ms , " said study author kassandra munger , scd , of harvard school of public health in boston .
" there 's a lot of research supporting the idea that adolescence may be an important time for development of disease , so what we have found is consistent with that . "
she added : " teaching and practicing obesity prevention from the start - but especially during teenage years - may be an important step in reducing the risk of ms later in life for women . "
susan kohlhaas , research communications officer for the ms society , said : " this study does not account for several other factors that may play a role in causing ms. based on that , more work is needed .
" as such , it is difficult to determine whether teenage obesity could be a possible factor in causing ms in women . "

but women who had a larger body size at 20 years of age also had almost twice the risk of ms compared to women who reported a thinner body size .
previous research has linked high levels of vitamin d with a reduced risk of ms and the researchers point out that obesity is associated with low vitamin d levels in the body .

she added : " teaching and practicing obesity prevention from the start - but especially during teenage years - may be an important step in reducing the risk of ms later in life for women . "
susan kohlhaas , research communications officer for the ms society , said : " this study does not account for several other factors that may play a role in causing ms. based on that , more work is needed .

i am very very happy to take part in the programme " question of the week " .
i feel it 's a very good effort from the staff of dw-tv towards the users .
this is the first time i try to answer this question .
" is your employer family friendly ? " .
in general , the relation of employer and the employee is very criticial and wholly depend on the attitudes of the employee , hard working and good response to the employer .
every employer becomes happy and appreciates the employer if he does some things good for his benefit , and increases the output of the business .
if these characters are fulfilled in any employee , of course the employer becomes family friendly .
my employer is family friendly because of these qualities .
thank you and best regards . - name : mogire machuki - country : kenya bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this weeks posed querry is so touching !
i work in the construction sector here in kisii , kenya .
my company is zero rated when it comes to family matters .
when it is work it is work .
no smart excuses !
so , here i seldom have time to enjoy life with my family .
working extra hours is a routine in my job .
i am at home regularly late in the evening and leave for work at dawn .
so my family often misses me .
my employers here seem not to care .
so the experience here of mixing family matters with work to a high degree is not well understood .
the only remedy is to employ a worker to help in the house at a certain fee .
but thanks to the mobile phone i can easily contact my family in case of an urgency . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

activists in the capitalist south are using the 20 year anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall to call for change . protesters in the south gathered close to the border in a bid to draw international attention to what they say are gross human-rights violations committed in the communist north .
they shouted " down with kim jong-il 's dictatorship " and demanded an end to the practice of political imprisonment .
the demonstrators also released a giant balloon carrying thousands of anti-dictatorship flyers , over the 245 kilometer long border .
the frontier , known officially as the demilitarized zone -lrb- dmz -rrb- , was created as part of the armistice which sealed the end of the 1950-1953 korean war .
it is lined with minefields , barbed wire and heavy armaments , and patrolled by a million soldiers .
there are two main crossing points , but they are rarely used .
communication between the two sides is minimal , with virtually no mail or telephone links between the sides .
could korea become the next germany ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : once unimaginable for germany .
could korea follow suit ?
but with celebrations underway in berlin to mark the momentous events of 1989 , south korean commentators have been talking about the possibility of the collapse of the single remaining cold war frontier .
an editorial in the korea herald newspaper said " just as the fall of the berlin wall took the west germans off guard , so may the collapse of the border fences come as a surprised to the south koreans . "
recent polls suggest that some sixty percent of south koreans favor unification with the north , but many add that they would be concerned about the financial implications .
and those would be massive .
south koreas gross national income is believed to be 38 times that of its northern counterpart .
analysts believe it would cost more than one trillion dollars for the south to absorb the north , which would be the only feasible scenario were the two sides to unite. tkw / reuters / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at her side were british prime minister gordon brown , presidents nicolas sarkozy of france and dmitry medvedev of russia , and us secretary of state hillary clinton , among other dignitaries , all clutching white umbrellas against the downpour .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and the other heads of state each delivered tributes to the people of berlin on a personal note , merkel - who grew up in east germany - said that the night of november 9 , 1989 was one of the happiest moments of her life .
but she also recalled a darker anniversary that is marked in germany each year on the same date - the pogroms against the jews in 1938 known as kristallnacht , or the " night of broken glass . "
these two events remind us " how fragile freedom is , and how it must be fought for again and again , " the chancellor said .
tributes to the people of berlin in his tribute , brown said the fall of the berlin wall should set an example to tackle the seemingly " impossible " challenges of today , including climate change , extreme poverty and nuclear proliferation .
the wall " was torn down by the greatest force of all - the unbreakable spirit of men and women of berlin , who dared to dream in the darkness , " he said .
in her remarks , clinton spoke of the need " to work together to advance freedom from beyond its current frontiers , so that people can pursue their dreams and live up to their god-given potential . "
she then introduced a surprise video address by us president barack obama , who said that " there could be no clearer rebuke of tyranny " than the sight of people tearing down the wall .
symbolic dominoes set in motion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dominoes created a symbolic wall in berlin a highlight of the festival was the symbolic toppling of 1,000 giant styrofoam dominoes along a 1.5-kilometer -lrb- one mile -rrb- stretch of the wall 's former course .
they were set in motion by former polish president lech walesa , recalling the sequence of events which began in early 1989 in poland and culminated with the fall of the wall .
the domino blocks were decorated by artists and schoolchildren in countries all over the world still affected by division and repression , and then sent back to berlin for monday night 's festival .
music to mark the moment the festival also featured several musical highlights .
the evening began with a concert by the staatskapelle berlin conducted by daniel barenboim , featuring compositions by ludwig van beethoven , richard wagner , arnold schoenberg and friedrich goldmann . tenor placido domingo sang a music-hall number celebrating berlin 's unique atmosphere , prompting enthusiastic calls of " encore ! " from the crowd . rocker jon bon jovi was also on hand to perform his new song , " we were n't born to follow . " the evening ended with a fireworks display , recalling the joyous atmosphere of 20 years ago , when people from east and west berlin celebrated the momentous events with spontaneous parties lasting well into the morning hours . author : deanne corbett editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german media estimated that lahm was forced to pay at least 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 75,000 -rrb- for his " unauthorized " interview with a german newspaper .
the club also handed italian striker luca toni a " severe fine " for leaving the stadium during saturday 's league match against schalke after being substituted at half-time .
bayern said toni 's departure from the allianz arena was an " unacceptable breach of discipline . "
however , it was lahm 's aforementioned interview with the german daily sueddeutsche zeitung published on saturday that really caused a stir in munich .
management 's fault ?
the german national player let off steam , following bayern 's disappointing results both in the bundesliga and the champions league over the past two weeks , slamming management 's purchasing policy of players as erratic .
" we currently have many players who have no position in the 4-3-3 system favored by our coach .
we have really good strikers but in the 4-3-3 system there are always two or three on the bench , " lahm told sueddeutsche zeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lahm , left , as bayern would rather see him in view of bayern 's likely premature exit from the champions league and their current 8th place in the bundesliga , lahm urged management to decide on a proper system and then buy the suitable players rather than simply just go after good players no matter whether they fit in or not .
" i think there were some unfortunate transfers in the past .
of course this also had to do with the fact that we had various coaches with different ideas in the last few years , " lahm said , adding " clubs like manchester or barcelona stipulate a system and the players are bought accordingly . " lahm attributed bayern 's mediocre performance this season to a gaping hole in the midfield .
" defenders need a player in the midfield that they can always pass the ball to … look at chelsea : frank lampard or michael ballack … they fulfill their role with such confidence that they 're always accessible .
i think our main problem lies in the midfield , " lahm said .
uncomfortable truths lahm 's comments hit a raw nerve with the club 's management who were quick to lash out at the 25-year-old , saying that he had violated club rules in " a flagrant and unacceptable manner " by failing to submit the interview for approval .
" we are disappointed because as a substitute captain -lrb- lahm -rrb- has a special responsibility for the team and club , " said general director karl-heinz rummenigge .
" so philipp lahm is fined a record amount never seen before at bayern . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : team chiefs rummenigge -lrb- left -rrb- and hoeness say lahm broke the rules however , many experts and soccer fans say lahm is being punished for simply speaking the truth to a management team that is good in dishing out criticism but loath to swallow any itself .
some experts say management 's biggest mistake was to let brazil 's ze roberto go to hsv – a move which left the creative gap that lahm pinpointed in the midfield .
a player of the calibre of ze roberto or bremen 's mesut oezil could have provided the missing link required to make full use of the undisputedly great wingers arjen robben and franck ribery , effectively providing the bavarians with a solid offensive and creative midfield .
incorrigible bayern critics say that bayern 's purchasing and club ethics invariably result in a patchwork star ensemble that lacks cohesion as a team , but the same critics often turn a blind eye to the fact that nonetheless the bavarian club has played a leading role in german and international soccer for much of the past two decades , clinching the bundesliga crown 21 times since 1931. nk / sz / dpa / afp editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

over the past five years , the charity says the number of such calls has risen five times faster than youngsters reporting abuse by a man .
of 16,094 children who called childline about sex abuse last year , 2,142 told of abuse by a woman , up 132 % on 2004-5 .
men still account for the majority of child abuse claims , but the nspcc said female sex abuse was under-reported .
this is because there is a reluctance or unwillingness on the part of professionals to acknowledge or identify sexual abuse by females , the charity suggested .
the research follows the recent high-profile case of nursery worker vanessa george , who abused children in her care .
she was a member of an internet paedophile ring which included another woman .
mothers childline 's report did not claim that sexual abuse by women was on the rise .
it instead suggested that , as more boys were tending to call its helpline , more cases were being reported . "
many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child " sue minto nspcc the research said nearly two-thirds -lrb- 1,311 -rrb- of the claims it received about sex abuse by a female involved the child 's mother .
just over twice as many victims -lrb- 2,972 -rrb- said they had been abused by their father - which amounted to 45 % of calls about sex abuse by males .
the number of children claiming to have been abused by men grew by 27 % in the same four-year period .
the childline research also showed that 42 % more children were calling the helpline in 2008-09 than in 2004-5 .
sue minto , head of childline , said : " most sex abuse calls to childline come from girls saying they were assaulted by a male .
" but a growing number of callers now say they were sexually abused by a female .
this may be partly because more boys are calling us than previously .
" many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child .
but they do . "
childline contacts childline is a free , confidential helpline which can be contacted on 0800 1111 you can also send e-mails via the childline website ' internalising ' dr lisa bunting , senior researcher at the nspcc , who has studied the issue , said : " there is such an intense stigma in disclosing incidents of abuse by women .
" we get a lot of stigma with any type of sex abuse , but this is particularly the case in the participation of women . "
she said this often led to victims " internalising " the abuse because they could not believe it had happened and did not think they would be believed .
she added : " if you do n't think females are capable of committing sex offences , then you are never going to be looking for that . "
the childline report said the issue of female sex offending was not well reflected in policy , practice and guidance on child protection and offender management .
it added : " it is important that regardless of what is currently known about the numbers of female offenders , more is done to understand the nature of sexual offending by women -lsb- and to -rsb- raise awareness among the public so that they can report it . "

of 16,094 children who called childline about sex abuse last year , 2,142 told of abuse by a woman , up 132 % on 2004-5 .
men still account for the majority of child abuse claims , but the nspcc said female sex abuse was under-reported .
this is because there is a reluctance or unwillingness on the part of professionals to acknowledge or identify sexual abuse by females , the charity suggested .
the research follows the recent high-profile case of nursery worker vanessa george , who abused children in her care .
she was a member of an internet paedophile ring which included another woman .
mothers childline 's report did not claim that sexual abuse by women was on the rise .
it instead suggested that , as more boys were tending to call its helpline , more cases were being reported .
many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child sue minto nspcc the research said nearly two-thirds -lrb- 1,311 -rrb- of the claims it received about sex abuse by a female involved the child 's mother .
just over twice as many victims -lrb- 2,972 -rrb- said they had been abused by their father - which amounted to 45 % of calls about sex abuse by males .
the number of children claiming to have been abused by men grew by 27 % in the same four-year period .
the childline research also showed that 42 % more children were calling the helpline in 2008-09 than in 2004-5 .
sue minto , head of childline , said : " most sex abuse calls to childline come from girls saying they were assaulted by a male .
" but a growing number of callers now say they were sexually abused by a female .
this may be partly because more boys are calling us than previously .
" many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child .
but they do . "
childline contacts childline is a free , confidential helpline which can be contacted on 0800 1111 you can also send e-mails via the childline website ' internalising ' dr lisa bunting , senior researcher at the nspcc , who has studied the issue , said : " there is such an intense stigma in disclosing incidents of abuse by women .
" we get a lot of stigma with any type of sex abuse , but this is particularly the case in the participation of women . "
she said this often led to victims " internalising " the abuse because they could not believe it had happened and did not think they would be believed .
she added : " if you do n't think females are capable of committing sex offences , then you are never going to be looking for that . "
the childline report said the issue of female sex offending was not well reflected in policy , practice and guidance on child protection and offender management .
it added : " it is important that regardless of what is currently known about the numbers of female offenders , more is done to understand the nature of sexual offending by women -lsb- and to -rsb- raise awareness among the public so that they can report it . "

chris cloke , childline nspcc : " we 've seen an increase ... going back five years " a huge rise in the number of children calling to report sexual abuse by women has been revealed by childline .
over the past five years , the charity says the number of such calls has risen five times faster than youngsters reporting abuse by a man .
of 16,094 children who called childline about sex abuse last year , 2,142 told of abuse by a woman , up 132 % on 2004-5 .
men still account for the majority of child abuse claims , but the nspcc said female sex abuse was under-reported .
this is because there is a reluctance or unwillingness on the part of professionals to acknowledge or identify sexual abuse by females , the charity suggested .
the research follows the recent high-profile case of nursery worker vanessa george , who abused children in her care .
she was a member of an internet paedophile ring which included another woman .
mothers childline 's report did not claim that sexual abuse by women was on the rise .
it instead suggested that , as more boys were tending to call its helpline , more cases were being reported .
many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child sue minto nspcc the research said nearly two-thirds -lrb- 1,311 -rrb- of the claims it received about sex abuse by a female involved the child 's mother .
just over twice as many victims -lrb- 2,972 -rrb- said they had been abused by their father - which amounted to 45 % of calls about sex abuse by males .
the number of children claiming to have been abused by men grew by 27 % in the same four-year period .
the childline research also showed that 42 % more children were calling the helpline in 2008-09 than in 2004-5 .
sue minto , head of childline , said : " most sex abuse calls to childline come from girls saying they were assaulted by a male .
" but a growing number of callers now say they were sexually abused by a female .
this may be partly because more boys are calling us than previously .
" many would find it shocking that any woman - let alone a mother - can sexually assault a child .
but they do . "
childline contacts childline is a free , confidential helpline which can be contacted on 0800 1111 you can also send e-mails via the childline website ' internalising ' dr lisa bunting , senior researcher at the nspcc , who has studied the issue , said : " there is such an intense stigma in disclosing incidents of abuse by women .
" we get a lot of stigma with any type of sex abuse , but this is particularly the case in the participation of women . "
she said this often led to victims " internalising " the abuse because they could not believe it had happened and did not think they would be believed .
she added : " if you do n't think females are capable of committing sex offences , then you are never going to be looking for that . "
the childline report said the issue of female sex offending was not well reflected in policy , practice and guidance on child protection and offender management .
it added : " it is important that regardless of what is currently known about the numbers of female offenders , more is done to understand the nature of sexual offending by women -lsb- and to -rsb- raise awareness among the public so that they can report it . "

eileen lawrence , 72 , drove onto the crossing in fairbourne , gwynedd , colliding with a train moving at 20mph .
she later admitted careless driving .
no-one was injured in the incident .
but members at the cambrian coast railway conference in porthmadog said the low fine issued was sending out the wrong message .
ms lawrence admitted careless driving and was fined £ 40 with three penalty points , with £ 80 costs and £ 15 victim surcharge by magistrates in dolgellau in september .
she had claimed to have been distracted when she collided with the machynlleth to pwllheli bound train on 14 may .
i have to admit that the £ 40 fine imposed was lenient and did not reflect the effect on the train driver who needed time off work pc bob newman the court heard the red warning lights and the audible warning sounds were working correctly at the railway crossing , which does not have barriers .
british transport police officer bob newman told the conference that the normal fine for contravention of the red railway crossing lights was around £ 120 .
" i have to admit that the £ 40 fine imposed was lenient and did not reflect the effect on the train driver , who needed time off work , or the inconvenience to the train passengers , " he said adding that the motorist was very lucky that she was not seriously injured .
conference chairman councillor trefor roberts , barmouth added : " such a low fine is sending out the wrong message . "
ben davies for arriva trains wales said that he would be in favour of train operators and the british transport police holding talks with the north wales magistrates court committees .
" between january and august this year there were 40 near-miss incidents reported in wales , " said mr davies .
" the majority of them involved motorists who narrowly avoided a potential fatal collision with a train . "
pc bob newman said that since april there had been 15 incidents of vehicles using railway crossings when the lights were on red , which was a decrease of five from the summer of 2008 .
members have agreed to try to arrange a meeting with magistrates to complain about the fine .

hollywood-based gruffudd recorded his part via a link between a studio near his la home and one in cardiff .

" they have a great record of producing high-quality animation for young children and i hope ella betsi will become a fan as soon as she 's old enough , " he said .
" she seemed to enjoy the scripts when i read them to her . "
the children 's show follows the adventures of a pig-tailed cave girl calon 's welsh-language voice director pat griffiths said : " i 'm so happy ioan was able to find time to do the narration .
" his voice is perfect , he is very warm and i 'm sure the young children watching the show will think he 's talking just to them . "
sian eirian , s4c 's head of children 's services , said : " securing the services of ioan gruffudd as narrator on this charming new series was something of a coup , and we 're delighted with the results . "
gavin and stacey star ruth jones is narrating the english-language version , which is due to be premiered next spring .
the series , a co-production with s4c , five , gaelic channel mg alba and the wales ip fund , was recently bought by australia 's public service broadcaster abc .
igam ogam will be screened on s4c at 1230 gmt from monday to friday until 4 december .
