the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2009 opinion : the eu could win in russia-ukraine gas crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and ukraine have agreed to allow european observers monitor the flow of russian gas , but each side is still blaming the other .
guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .

" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .

in the worst-case scenario , the property could accrue annual losses of 14.2 million euros , said sven lemiss , the head of berliner immobilienmanagement -lrb- bim -rrb- in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
in comparison , while tempelhof was still operational , it racked up a yearly deficit of some 10 million euros . so where are the additional costs coming from ?
lemiss pointed to a bill from the city 's cleaning firm , bsr .
because the airport is closed , it is classed as a normal property , and therefore incurs cleaning fees for the surrounding public roads . " that amounts to a seven-figure bill , " lemiss said .
in bim 's view , these costs could be avoided should tempelhof continue to be classed as a special property to which the street cleaning fees do not apply . tempelhof 's losses used to be absorbed by the airport operator .
now though , the burden falls to the government , which closed down the historic airfield before a plan for its future use had been approved . currently , the police force is leasing space in the former terminal , and bim says it has plans to lease more space to both businesses and cultural organizations . babelsberg keen to acquire space bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg is facing capacity problems and thinks tempelhof is the answer the most promising proposal , though , comes from babelsberg film studios , currently housed in a suburb of potsdam some 30 kilometers southwest of berlin .
thanks to increased international film production demands , babelsberg needs more capacity .
its bosses would like to transform tempelhof into a major movie production center in the heart of berlin . besides making use of tempelhof 's voluminous airport hangars , babelsberg company chiefs say their plans would involve the creation of a public events center , along with offices and apartment complexes for film workers and artists . babelsberg chief carl woebcken said that , if approved by the berlin authorities , the project will enable the historic film company to " greatly expand studio production capacity . " the berlin senate is currently running an " ideas competition " for tempelhof , with a decision expected at the end of january for the site 's future use . other proposals that were being considered before the closure included maintaining tempelhof as a short-haul inner city airport , and converting it into a medical center with convenient airport facilities . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 . " the december figures show that the economic crisis has reached the labor market , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise when releasing the data . germany in better shape to cope , say economists but elga bartsch , economist with morgan stanley , said that there is a key difference between the current downturn in germany and the one that hit the country in the early part of this decade . " back then , germany was seen as the sick man of europe , mired in deep-rooted structural problems , " said bartsch .
" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing . " the new batch of bleak economic data comes as german chancellor angela merkel 's government attempts to piece together a second stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- to help the nation limp through what is expected to be the country 's biggest economic downturn since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to finance , merkel has been called ' madame non ' this follows a first raft of measures worth over 30 billion euros agreed last november that was widely derided by critics as being too puny as it included only 12 billion euros of real new spending . on top of that , berlin has earmarked 100 billion euros to help german companies face the growing world-wide economic crisis . small- and medium-sized firms - regarded as the backbone of germany 's economy - complained on thursday that the credit crunch is still harming their ability to get fresh funds from the banks . " after a significant easing last year , many small- and mini-firms in particular are suffering from restrictive lending , " the german association for small- and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said in a statement . " they are still really feeling the effects of the banking crisis and the collapse of -lrb- us investment bank -rrb- lehman brothers , " said the association , which represents 3.3 million firms in germany 's powerful " mittelstand " sector . the misery is only set to get worse as the year unfolds , analysts say . the president of the influential ifo economic institute , hans-werner sinn , warned this week that no recovery was likely before 2011 and said unemployment could rise as high as four million . pressure building during election year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partners and rivals : steinmeier and merkel merkel is also battling to strike a balance between a push by her conservative christian social union allies for big tax cuts to spur growth and her social democrat coalition partners , who have been resisting lowering taxation . such prevailing gloom means the economy will be one of the main battlegrounds throughout 2009 - a key political year , during which germany holds a parliamentary election on sept .
27 and several crucial state polls . the first of these state elections is due on jan .
18 in the western state of hesse , home to frankfurt , germany 's major financial centre . the latest opinion polls in hesse suggest a coalition of merkel 's cdu party and the free-market free democratic party will win a clear majority .
the cdu governs at the national level in coalition with the center-left social democrats . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal .

the offer of a sought-after theater technician 's job to the former dropout by klaus peymann , director of the berliner ensemble , a theatre which receives most of its budget in state grants , angered many , since klar has never expressed contrition .
berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit suggested it was just a publicity stunt by the theatre .
a berlin newspaper ran a front page friday showing klar , who now lives in berlin , standing outside the theatre .
lawyer heinz-juergen schneider said klar had relinquished the opportunity because of the " continuing , aggressive campaign in the media " against his client .
the city of berlin said through a spokesman that the outcome was " sensible . "
the lawyer said klar was also suing bz for breach of privacy .
klar would look for a less prominent job in berlin .
germany 's ordeal as the terrorists assassinated , bombed and robbed came to the big screen last year with the release of an action film , the baader meinhof complex , named after the terrorist group 's late founders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof .
ignes ponto , widow of one of raf 's victims , failed friday in a lawsuit demanding changes to the film .
she watched klar shoot dead her husband juergen ponto in the entrance to their home in 1977 after the couple had opened the door to a young woman friend who had joined the terrorists .
the state court in cologne said artistic license was allowed and rejected ponto 's complaint that the scene was depicted inaccurately and sensationalized .
she was so upset by the film , which germany 's film export board has nominated for an oscar , that she sent back a german government honor , the cross of merit , which she received for her resilience after the assassination . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .
cats get annoyed if they feel ignored .
so i made sure he did n't feel ignored . "
there is no news about whether or not the accidental “ weathercat ” will be making a repeat performance . dw staff -lrb- mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .

now a breakthrough in the negotiations could mean the end of the dispute . russia agreed thursday to allow monitors to observe russian gas flow through ukraine in a move that " should " lead to the resumption of gas supplies to the european union , the czech eu presidency said .
ten to 12 observers from the european gas industry and the european commission were due on the ground as early as friday .
the breakthrough followed talks between czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , and russian prime minister vladimir putin , the presidency said in a statement .
" now the only decision missing is to put the gas in the system again , " a czech official close to the talks said .
earlier thursday , talks in brussels on renewal of gas deliveries to europe fell through because ukraine rejected gazprom 's demand to include its own observers in the eu 's monitoring mission , czech officials said .
the reversal in russia 's stance came hours after the failed negotiations .
ukraine then quickly reassured the european union of its readiness to restart gas deliveries to western europe .
as soon as russia ends its delivery ban , ukraine would guarantee gas transit to the west , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko told eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a phone discussion , the interfax news agency said , quoting sources in the kyiv presidential office .

according to the itar-tass news agency , there were indications that gazprom chief alexei miller and naftogaz head oleg dubina were to meet in the black sea resort town of sochi .
russia shut down gas deliveries flowing to europe via ukraine on wednesday amid a row with ukraine over a new delivery contract and alleged unpaid bills .
russia accused ukraine of stealing gas bound for europe , an allegation that ukraine has rejected .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2009 opinion : the eu could win in russia-ukraine gas crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and ukraine have agreed to allow european observers monitor the flow of russian gas , but each side is still blaming the other .
guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "

over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .

" ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal .

russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

now a breakthrough in the negotiations could mean the end of the dispute . russia agreed thursday to allow monitors to observe russian gas flow through ukraine in a move that " should " lead to the resumption of gas supplies to the european union , the czech eu presidency said .
ten to 12 observers from the european gas industry and the european commission were due on the ground as early as friday .
the breakthrough followed talks between czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , and russian prime minister vladimir putin , the presidency said in a statement .
" now the only decision missing is to put the gas in the system again , " a czech official close to the talks said .
earlier thursday , talks in brussels on renewal of gas deliveries to europe fell through because ukraine rejected gazprom 's demand to include its own observers in the eu 's monitoring mission , czech officials said .
the reversal in russia 's stance came hours after the failed negotiations .
ukraine then quickly reassured the european union of its readiness to restart gas deliveries to western europe .
as soon as russia ends its delivery ban , ukraine would guarantee gas transit to the west , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko told eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a phone discussion , the interfax news agency said , quoting sources in the kyiv presidential office .
negotiations to continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bulgaria , in particular , has suffered from the gas crisis while the gas shortage continues to affect parts of europe , frustration is growing in brussels over the failure of the two countries to agree on the participation of russian experts in the observer mission .
moscow expected talks between russian state-run gas provider gazprom and its ukrainian counterpart naftogaz to continue on friday .
according to the itar-tass news agency , there were indications that gazprom chief alexei miller and naftogaz head oleg dubina were to meet in the black sea resort town of sochi .
russia shut down gas deliveries flowing to europe via ukraine on wednesday amid a row with ukraine over a new delivery contract and alleged unpaid bills .
russia accused ukraine of stealing gas bound for europe , an allegation that ukraine has rejected .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2009 opinion : the eu could win in russia-ukraine gas crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and ukraine have agreed to allow european observers monitor the flow of russian gas , but each side is still blaming the other .
guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 .

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2009 opinion : the eu could win in russia-ukraine gas crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and ukraine have agreed to allow european observers monitor the flow of russian gas , but each side is still blaming the other .
guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .
cats get annoyed if they feel ignored .
so i made sure he did n't feel ignored . "

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .
eu energy ministers are set to hold yet another emergency meeting on the issue on monday . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 . " the december figures show that the economic crisis has reached the labor market , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise when releasing the data . germany in better shape to cope , say economists but elga bartsch , economist with morgan stanley , said that there is a key difference between the current downturn in germany and the one that hit the country in the early part of this decade . " back then , germany was seen as the sick man of europe , mired in deep-rooted structural problems , " said bartsch .
" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing .

the offer of a sought-after theater technician 's job to the former dropout by klaus peymann , director of the berliner ensemble , a theatre which receives most of its budget in state grants , angered many , since klar has never expressed contrition .
berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit suggested it was just a publicity stunt by the theatre .
a berlin newspaper ran a front page friday showing klar , who now lives in berlin , standing outside the theatre .
lawyer heinz-juergen schneider said klar had relinquished the opportunity because of the " continuing , aggressive campaign in the media " against his client .
the city of berlin said through a spokesman that the outcome was " sensible . "
the lawyer said klar was also suing bz for breach of privacy .
klar would look for a less prominent job in berlin .
germany 's ordeal as the terrorists assassinated , bombed and robbed came to the big screen last year with the release of an action film , the baader meinhof complex , named after the terrorist group 's late founders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof .
ignes ponto , widow of one of raf 's victims , failed friday in a lawsuit demanding changes to the film .
she watched klar shoot dead her husband juergen ponto in the entrance to their home in 1977 after the couple had opened the door to a young woman friend who had joined the terrorists .
the state court in cologne said artistic license was allowed and rejected ponto 's complaint that the scene was depicted inaccurately and sensationalized .
she was so upset by the film , which germany 's film export board has nominated for an oscar , that she sent back a german government honor , the cross of merit , which she received for her resilience after the assassination . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the worst-case scenario , the property could accrue annual losses of 14.2 million euros , said sven lemiss , the head of berliner immobilienmanagement -lrb- bim -rrb- in an interview with the tagesspiegel newspaper .
in comparison , while tempelhof was still operational , it racked up a yearly deficit of some 10 million euros . so where are the additional costs coming from ?
lemiss pointed to a bill from the city 's cleaning firm , bsr .
because the airport is closed , it is classed as a normal property , and therefore incurs cleaning fees for the surrounding public roads . " that amounts to a seven-figure bill , " lemiss said .
in bim 's view , these costs could be avoided should tempelhof continue to be classed as a special property to which the street cleaning fees do not apply . tempelhof 's losses used to be absorbed by the airport operator .
now though , the burden falls to the government , which closed down the historic airfield before a plan for its future use had been approved . currently , the police force is leasing space in the former terminal , and bim says it has plans to lease more space to both businesses and cultural organizations . babelsberg keen to acquire space bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg is facing capacity problems and thinks tempelhof is the answer the most promising proposal , though , comes from babelsberg film studios , currently housed in a suburb of potsdam some 30 kilometers southwest of berlin .
thanks to increased international film production demands , babelsberg needs more capacity .
its bosses would like to transform tempelhof into a major movie production center in the heart of berlin . besides making use of tempelhof 's voluminous airport hangars , babelsberg company chiefs say their plans would involve the creation of a public events center , along with offices and apartment complexes for film workers and artists . babelsberg chief carl woebcken said that , if approved by the berlin authorities , the project will enable the historic film company to " greatly expand studio production capacity . " the berlin senate is currently running an " ideas competition " for tempelhof , with a decision expected at the end of january for the site 's future use . other proposals that were being considered before the closure included maintaining tempelhof as a short-haul inner city airport , and converting it into a medical center with convenient airport facilities . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .
cats get annoyed if they feel ignored .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 09.01.2009 opinion : the eu could win in russia-ukraine gas crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia and ukraine have agreed to allow european observers monitor the flow of russian gas , but each side is still blaming the other .
guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 .

" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing .

" after a significant easing last year , many small- and mini-firms in particular are suffering from restrictive lending , " the german association for small- and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said in a statement . " they are still really feeling the effects of the banking crisis and the collapse of -lrb- us investment bank -rrb- lehman brothers , " said the association , which represents 3.3 million firms in germany 's powerful " mittelstand " sector . the misery is only set to get worse as the year unfolds , analysts say . the president of the influential ifo economic institute , hans-werner sinn , warned this week that no recovery was likely before 2011 and said unemployment could rise as high as four million . pressure building during election year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partners and rivals : steinmeier and merkel merkel is also battling to strike a balance between a push by her conservative christian social union allies for big tax cuts to spur growth and her social democrat coalition partners , who have been resisting lowering taxation . such prevailing gloom means the economy will be one of the main battlegrounds throughout 2009 - a key political year , during which germany holds a parliamentary election on sept .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .

russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza . " other humanitarian partners are subject to similar and unacceptable incidents and as a consequence are forced to reduce or stop their operations . „ these activities are crucial in bringing essential assistance to the suffering population of gaza , " eu humanitarian aid commissioner louis michel said in a separate statement . humanitarian crisis prompts strong eu tone the eu presidency , which the czech republic assumed on january 1 , also voiced its deep concern at the attacks on humanitarian convoys . " we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .
israel has called for closing the reported hundreds of tunnels across gaza 's borders , which had allowed the smuggling of an arsenal of missiles used by hamas to hit israel . dw staff -lrb- kjb , mrm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .
" i do n't know how he got into the studio , " kachelmann told reuters news agency , adding lupin belonged to a staffer who was out of town .
" i noticed him when he rubbed against my leg and thought people might wonder what was happening .
i figured it would be easier to control the cat by picking him up .
cats get annoyed if they feel ignored .
so i made sure he did n't feel ignored . "

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 . " the december figures show that the economic crisis has reached the labor market , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise when releasing the data . germany in better shape to cope , say economists but elga bartsch , economist with morgan stanley , said that there is a key difference between the current downturn in germany and the one that hit the country in the early part of this decade . " back then , germany was seen as the sick man of europe , mired in deep-rooted structural problems , " said bartsch .
" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing . " the new batch of bleak economic data comes as german chancellor angela merkel 's government attempts to piece together a second stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- to help the nation limp through what is expected to be the country 's biggest economic downturn since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to finance , merkel has been called ' madame non ' this follows a first raft of measures worth over 30 billion euros agreed last november that was widely derided by critics as being too puny as it included only 12 billion euros of real new spending . on top of that , berlin has earmarked 100 billion euros to help german companies face the growing world-wide economic crisis . small- and medium-sized firms - regarded as the backbone of germany 's economy - complained on thursday that the credit crunch is still harming their ability to get fresh funds from the banks . " after a significant easing last year , many small- and mini-firms in particular are suffering from restrictive lending , " the german association for small- and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said in a statement . " they are still really feeling the effects of the banking crisis and the collapse of -lrb- us investment bank -rrb- lehman brothers , " said the association , which represents 3.3 million firms in germany 's powerful " mittelstand " sector . the misery is only set to get worse as the year unfolds , analysts say . the president of the influential ifo economic institute , hans-werner sinn , warned this week that no recovery was likely before 2011 and said unemployment could rise as high as four million . pressure building during election year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partners and rivals : steinmeier and merkel merkel is also battling to strike a balance between a push by her conservative christian social union allies for big tax cuts to spur growth and her social democrat coalition partners , who have been resisting lowering taxation . such prevailing gloom means the economy will be one of the main battlegrounds throughout 2009 - a key political year , during which germany holds a parliamentary election on sept .
27 and several crucial state polls . the first of these state elections is due on jan .
18 in the western state of hesse , home to frankfurt , germany 's major financial centre . the latest opinion polls in hesse suggest a coalition of merkel 's cdu party and the free-market free democratic party will win a clear majority .

the move signals the first time the government has taken a stake in a major private bank and comes as commerzbank is set to buy dresdner bank . commerzbank , germany 's second largest bank , is to be recapitalized again as the state takes a 25-percent-plus-one-share stake in return for 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 13.6 billion -rrb- in fresh funds . the capital comes on top of the 8.2 billion euros that soffin , the state rescue fund for the banking sector , already granted commerzbank in november .
soffin will pay 6.0 euros per share . according to a statement from commerzbank , the german government " is clarifying all further details with the eu commission . " analysts say commerzbank requires the additional cash as it moves to acquire another struggling bank , dresdner bank , from insurance giant allianz at the end of january . " if the government had n't come on board , the dresdner takeover probably would n't have happened , " frankfurt-based banking professor martin faust told the berliner zeitung .
" and that would have had dramatic consequences for everyone involved . " government will have seats on the board the landmark move by the government to take a stake in a private bank will give it a veto right on board decisions of the new commerzbank-dresdner unit . " we are taking 25 percent ; of course we will join the supervisory board , " finance ministry spokesman torsten albig told reuters news agency .
he added , however , that the ministry would not seek to influence the bank 's operations . analysts say the german government 's second cash injection signals support for the bank 's rise to become a rival to deutsche bank . the head of the social democratic party , franz müntefering , defended the move and said it was not part of a nationalization scheme . " the government is stepping in for a time , but at a sensible time in the near future , it will step back , " he said . preparing for the storm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : blessing promised a stronger commerzbank according to the finance ministry , the move " sent a strong signal to a strong commerzbank . "
the deal will increase the core capital ratio of the commerzbank unit to 10 percent . " we are weatherproofing our bank for an economically stormy environment , " commerzbank chief executive martin blessing was quoted as saying .
" this will enable us to fulfill our responsibility to offer loans to the german economy and to ensure we will continue to be a reliable partner for our clients . " on the same day that the government stake was announced , commerzbank launched a bond issue worth more than one billion euros , the first to be underpinned by state guarantees . the commerzbank takeover of dresdner bank from allianz is expected to be completed by the end of the month .
under the acquisition , allianz will boost dresdner bank 's capital by taking over collateralized debt obligations with a nominal value of 2 billion euros at a purchase price of 1.1 billion euros . the news of the government injection prompted commerzbank shares to drop as much as 15 percent on friday .
over the past year , the stock has fallen more than 80 percent . dw staff -lrb- ls / dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

guest commentator thomas urban says the row is about a lot more than just money . as the conflict between russia and ukraine over gas payments continues this week , russian prime minister vladimir putin is hoping that europe will finally realize just how important the building of the planned pipeline is from russia to the eu via the baltic sea .
could this be the real reason behind the conflict that is affecting south-eastern europe so drastically and has also raised concern in western europe ?
from putin 's point of view , ukraine should be discredited in europe 's eyes as an unreliable transit nation .
apparently moscow is counting on the eu to not remain dependent on ukraine , which is politically instable anyway , and finally close the deal on the russian-german baltic sea pipeline .
bildunterschrift : thomas urban says non-payment from ukraine is just a surface issue but five eu member states - namely sweden , poland and the three former soviet satellite states lithuania , latvia and estonia - are against the idea .
their official objection is an environmental one : the baltic sea still contains contamination from chemical weapons used during world war ii , and most of that is located directly in the area where the pipeline is to be laid .
in reality , however , the governments of these five nations see the pipeline as political leverage the kremlin can use to marginalize poland as a viable gas transit nation .
poland , as well as the baltic state , would be disconnected from the european gas network and left at the mercy of the kremlin , just as ukraine is now .
winners and losers over the past few years putin has made it clear that moscow would play the energy card if ukraine continued to pursue western alliances like the eu and nato .
and because a large percentage of western european politicians hold kyiv partially responsible for the current crisis , one thing is certain : ukraine 's attempt to make itself out to be a victim of russian power politics has n't brought it any further in its quest for membership .
if anything , it has made this goal of ukrainian president viktor yushchenko , even less of a possibility .
however , it increasingly looks like this power struggle between moscow and kyiv is going to end in a pyrrhic victory for putin , because the call within eu nations to seek out other sources of energy is getting louder .
but both kyiv and moscow are going to lose this battle .
ukraine will be seen as an unreliable transit nation , while russia will be seen as an unreliable supplier which uses its position as purveyor of raw materials to maintain influence over neighboring nations . the eu could be the real winner , if its member states finally agree on a common energy strategy .
the mere fact that both sides have invited eu inspectors in , essentially recognizing the eu as arbitrator in this dispute , lends significance to the union .
now all it has to do is seize the opportunity .

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 . " the december figures show that the economic crisis has reached the labor market , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise when releasing the data . germany in better shape to cope , say economists but elga bartsch , economist with morgan stanley , said that there is a key difference between the current downturn in germany and the one that hit the country in the early part of this decade . " back then , germany was seen as the sick man of europe , mired in deep-rooted structural problems , " said bartsch .
" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing . " the new batch of bleak economic data comes as german chancellor angela merkel 's government attempts to piece together a second stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- to help the nation limp through what is expected to be the country 's biggest economic downturn since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to finance , merkel has been called ' madame non ' this follows a first raft of measures worth over 30 billion euros agreed last november that was widely derided by critics as being too puny as it included only 12 billion euros of real new spending . on top of that , berlin has earmarked 100 billion euros to help german companies face the growing world-wide economic crisis . small- and medium-sized firms - regarded as the backbone of germany 's economy - complained on thursday that the credit crunch is still harming their ability to get fresh funds from the banks . " after a significant easing last year , many small- and mini-firms in particular are suffering from restrictive lending , " the german association for small- and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said in a statement . " they are still really feeling the effects of the banking crisis and the collapse of -lrb- us investment bank -rrb- lehman brothers , " said the association , which represents 3.3 million firms in germany 's powerful " mittelstand " sector . the misery is only set to get worse as the year unfolds , analysts say . the president of the influential ifo economic institute , hans-werner sinn , warned this week that no recovery was likely before 2011 and said unemployment could rise as high as four million . pressure building during election year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partners and rivals : steinmeier and merkel merkel is also battling to strike a balance between a push by her conservative christian social union allies for big tax cuts to spur growth and her social democrat coalition partners , who have been resisting lowering taxation . such prevailing gloom means the economy will be one of the main battlegrounds throughout 2009 - a key political year , during which germany holds a parliamentary election on sept .
27 and several crucial state polls . the first of these state elections is due on jan .
18 in the western state of hesse , home to frankfurt , germany 's major financial centre . the latest opinion polls in hesse suggest a coalition of merkel 's cdu party and the free-market free democratic party will win a clear majority .

now a breakthrough in the negotiations could mean the end of the dispute . russia agreed thursday to allow monitors to observe russian gas flow through ukraine in a move that " should " lead to the resumption of gas supplies to the european union , the czech eu presidency said .
ten to 12 observers from the european gas industry and the european commission were due on the ground as early as friday .
the breakthrough followed talks between czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , and russian prime minister vladimir putin , the presidency said in a statement .
" now the only decision missing is to put the gas in the system again , " a czech official close to the talks said .
earlier thursday , talks in brussels on renewal of gas deliveries to europe fell through because ukraine rejected gazprom 's demand to include its own observers in the eu 's monitoring mission , czech officials said .
the reversal in russia 's stance came hours after the failed negotiations .
ukraine then quickly reassured the european union of its readiness to restart gas deliveries to western europe .
as soon as russia ends its delivery ban , ukraine would guarantee gas transit to the west , ukrainian president viktor yushchenko told eu commission president jose manuel barroso in a phone discussion , the interfax news agency said , quoting sources in the kyiv presidential office .

moscow expected talks between russian state-run gas provider gazprom and its ukrainian counterpart naftogaz to continue on friday .
according to the itar-tass news agency , there were indications that gazprom chief alexei miller and naftogaz head oleg dubina were to meet in the black sea resort town of sochi .
russia shut down gas deliveries flowing to europe via ukraine on wednesday amid a row with ukraine over a new delivery contract and alleged unpaid bills .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

now a breakthrough in the negotiations could mean the end of the dispute . russia agreed thursday to allow monitors to observe russian gas flow through ukraine in a move that " should " lead to the resumption of gas supplies to the european union , the czech eu presidency said .
ten to 12 observers from the european gas industry and the european commission were due on the ground as early as friday .
the breakthrough followed talks between czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country chairs the eu until june 30 , and russian prime minister vladimir putin , the presidency said in a statement .
" now the only decision missing is to put the gas in the system again , " a czech official close to the talks said .
earlier thursday , talks in brussels on renewal of gas deliveries to europe fell through because ukraine rejected gazprom 's demand to include its own observers in the eu 's monitoring mission , czech officials said .
the reversal in russia 's stance came hours after the failed negotiations .
ukraine then quickly reassured the european union of its readiness to restart gas deliveries to western europe .

" the presidency is deeply concerned over the continuing israeli military action in gaza and the continuation of indiscriminate rocket attacks on israel , " the eu presidency said in a statement . " we call on all parties to restrain from acts that further escalate an already tense situation , " it added . the eu presidency called on all parties to fully implement a truce order from the un security council . a defiant israel pounded gaza with bombs and shells friday , vowing to pursue its war on hamas despite the un decision , amid warnings the population was running out of food . the european commission meanwhile condemned " in the strongest terms " the attacks on un humanitarian convoys and personnel in gaza .

" we call on israel to work and closely coordinate with humanitarian organisations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is very concerned about the humanitarian situation " the presidency firmly believes that only a full and immediate ceasefire will allow the delivery and distribution of the large quantities of humanitarian aid that gaza desperately needs and for the resumption of basic services , " the statement said . the eu presidency " deplores the ongoing hostilities , which have led to an increasing number of civilian casualties in gaza and israel , " it added . however the statement also said the eu " shares israel 's concerns over the smuggling of weapons into gaza , " and was examining ways to assist in helping secure the border , " within the framework of an international mission . " the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

" the eu is ready to redeploy its former mission at the rafah crossing point from the gaza strip to egypt but also called on israel to open all its border crossings with gaza " to allow the regular and predictable movement of persons , humanitarian aid and commercial goods " . " we strongly believe that a viable gazan economy is essential for a sustainable peace , " it said . the un security council also urged israel and hamas to immediately end the gaza conflict as heavy air strikes and rocket attacks continued through friday as israeli leaders met to discuss a un resolution .
israel 's security cabinet decided on friday to continue its military campaign in the gaza strip , israel radio reported , in spite of a un security council resolution calling for an immediate ceasefire .
the death toll in the two-week-old offensive has risen to almost 800 .
palestinian emergency services said friday 's strikes killed 12 civilians , and that as many as half of the total number of victims so far were civilians .
israeli cabinet rejects outside interference caretaker prime minister ehud olmert said in a statement that israel " has never agreed that any outside body would determine its right to defend the security of its citizens , adding that the military would continue " operations in order to defend israeli citizens and will carry out the missions with which it has been assigned in the operation . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both israeli prime minister ehud olmert and foreign minister tzipi livni rejected the resolution olmert convened his inner security cabinet friday morning to discuss israel 's response to the resolution . israel also maintains an option , analysts said , to go to " phase three , " which would mean sending more ground troops deeper into populated areas . fighting continued even after the resolution was passed with israel conducting airstrikes in the gaza strip , killing 11 palestinians .
over 30 rockets and mortars were fired by palestinian militants at israel , with one landing in an empty school , local media reported . hamas agrees hamas had already rejected the resolution , with spokesman sami abu zuhri telling arabic news channel al-jazeera from yemen , " we are not concerned by the decision because hamas was not consulted and it did not take into consideration the interest and demands of our people in gaza . "
" this resolution does not suit us because it is not in the best interest of the palestinian people , " raafat morra of hamas told afp news agency in beirut .
" this resolution does not take into account the aspiration of the palestinian people . "
the 15-nation un security council had voted 14-0 late thursday , with the united states abstaining , to adopt the resolution demanding a ceasefire .
the vote capped three days of intense , closed-door negotiations at united nations headquarters to hammer out a compromise text acceptable to the permanent members with veto power - the united states , france , britain , russia and china .
us secretary of state condoleezza rice and foreign ministers bernard kouchner of france and david miliband of britain drafted the ceasefire text together with arab ministers and arab league secretary general amr moussa .
us calls for support of egyptian peace plan rice said despite her abstention that the united states supports the contents of the resolution .
she in particular called on the un to support the peace initiative made by egyptian president hosni mubarak .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rice said the us supported the ceasefire plan , although it abstained from voting those efforts , however , appear to have to run into trouble because of disagreements with israel over how to secure the border to prevent hamas from rearming , diplomats said . israeli and european diplomats , speaking to reuters on condition of anonymity , said egypt had objections to proposals for foreign forces deploying on the egyptian side of its 15-km -lrb- 9-mile -rrb- border with the gaza strip . instead of foreign troops , cairo told israel and the european union , it was prepared to accept only increased international technical assistance to help its own forces combat arms smuggling through tunnels dug across the border .
israel is demanding the tunnel traffic end as part of a ceasefire deal . " the truce talks are going nowhere at the moment , " said a senior european diplomat involved in the effort .
" there is a growing sense that the egyptian-french plan is not going to work . " un human rights chief calls for independent investigation united nations human rights chief navi pillay has called for an independent investigation and warned that some reported violations may constitute war crimes . according to news agency afp pillay told a special session of the un human rights council that israel and palestinian militants had an obligation under international humanitarian law to care for the wounded , and to protect ambulances , hospitals and health workers . the former south african judge also slammed rocket attacks by palestinian militants from gaza on israel as unacceptable . schools , hospitals , power and water supplies in the gaza strip had been driven to breaking point and must not be jeopardized by continued attacks , while civilians must be spared under international humanitarian law , she added . the un high commissioner for human rights underlined that the conditions for civilians in the gaza strip " constitute egregious violations of human rights " .
arms smuggling still a key issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the offensive has sparked protests across europe according to the un resolution , a durable ceasefire would require " arrangements and guarantees " for its implementation .
those arrangements include a ban on the smuggling of illicit weapons and ammunition , the sustained reopening of crossings into gaza and the support of an initiative by egypt and other regional and international efforts that are underway to end the conflict , which enters its 14th day on friday .
the text endorsed the egyptian initiative , which was made public tuesday by president mubarak when he met with french president nicholas sarkozy and later with german chancellor angela merkel in cairo .
the initiative has received support from the european union , the united states and palestinian authority president mahmoud abbas .
while mubarak gave the green light to the initiative , he has so far refused to open the rafah crossing between gaza and egypt , fearing that it would bring a great number of palestinian refugees into egyptian territory .

meanwhile a slew of fresh data suggests a deepening recession is taking hold . figures released this week showing a dramatic 10.6 percent plunge in german exports in november along with a hefty drop in factory orders and a larger-than-forecast rise in december unemployment point to the economic downturn rapidly gaining ground . meanwhile , the country 's manufacturing sector is also feeling the pain from the global economic crisis , with orders for german industrial goods diving 6 percent , much worse than economists had feared . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is no longer the sick man but its hardly healthy figures to be released friday are tipped to show german industrial production in the nation falling by 2 percent in november .
this would represent a drop of 5.5 percent over the year . after sinking into recession during the third quarter last year , economists have been revising down sharply their 2009 forecasts , with projections pointing to the german economy contracting by between 2 and even 4 percent this year . leading german companies have already announced plans for layoffs and production cuts as global economic growth spirals downwards . the german labor office said this week that unemployment in the nation rose for the first time in nearly three years in december with the number of jobless rising in seasonally adjusted terms by a more-than-forecast 18,000 . " the december figures show that the economic crisis has reached the labor market , " said labor office chief frank-juergen weise when releasing the data . germany in better shape to cope , say economists but elga bartsch , economist with morgan stanley , said that there is a key difference between the current downturn in germany and the one that hit the country in the early part of this decade . " back then , germany was seen as the sick man of europe , mired in deep-rooted structural problems , " said bartsch .
" today , germany is in for a major cyclical downturn , but it does so on much stronger structural footing . " the new batch of bleak economic data comes as german chancellor angela merkel 's government attempts to piece together a second stimulus package worth up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 68 billion -rrb- to help the nation limp through what is expected to be the country 's biggest economic downturn since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when it comes to finance , merkel has been called ' madame non ' this follows a first raft of measures worth over 30 billion euros agreed last november that was widely derided by critics as being too puny as it included only 12 billion euros of real new spending . on top of that , berlin has earmarked 100 billion euros to help german companies face the growing world-wide economic crisis . small- and medium-sized firms - regarded as the backbone of germany 's economy - complained on thursday that the credit crunch is still harming their ability to get fresh funds from the banks . " after a significant easing last year , many small- and mini-firms in particular are suffering from restrictive lending , " the german association for small- and medium-sized businesses -lrb- bvmw -rrb- said in a statement . " they are still really feeling the effects of the banking crisis and the collapse of -lrb- us investment bank -rrb- lehman brothers , " said the association , which represents 3.3 million firms in germany 's powerful " mittelstand " sector . the misery is only set to get worse as the year unfolds , analysts say . the president of the influential ifo economic institute , hans-werner sinn , warned this week that no recovery was likely before 2011 and said unemployment could rise as high as four million . pressure building during election year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : partners and rivals : steinmeier and merkel merkel is also battling to strike a balance between a push by her conservative christian social union allies for big tax cuts to spur growth and her social democrat coalition partners , who have been resisting lowering taxation . such prevailing gloom means the economy will be one of the main battlegrounds throughout 2009 - a key political year , during which germany holds a parliamentary election on sept .

the offer of a sought-after theater technician 's job to the former dropout by klaus peymann , director of the berliner ensemble , a theatre which receives most of its budget in state grants , angered many , since klar has never expressed contrition .
berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit suggested it was just a publicity stunt by the theatre .
a berlin newspaper ran a front page friday showing klar , who now lives in berlin , standing outside the theatre .
lawyer heinz-juergen schneider said klar had relinquished the opportunity because of the " continuing , aggressive campaign in the media " against his client .
the city of berlin said through a spokesman that the outcome was " sensible . "
the lawyer said klar was also suing bz for breach of privacy .
klar would look for a less prominent job in berlin .
germany 's ordeal as the terrorists assassinated , bombed and robbed came to the big screen last year with the release of an action film , the baader meinhof complex , named after the terrorist group 's late founders , andreas baader and ulrike meinhof .
ignes ponto , widow of one of raf 's victims , failed friday in a lawsuit demanding changes to the film .
she watched klar shoot dead her husband juergen ponto in the entrance to their home in 1977 after the couple had opened the door to a young woman friend who had joined the terrorists .
the state court in cologne said artistic license was allowed and rejected ponto 's complaint that the scene was depicted inaccurately and sensationalized .
she was so upset by the film , which germany 's film export board has nominated for an oscar , that she sent back a german government honor , the cross of merit , which she received for her resilience after the assassination . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .

russia wants the monitors in place to track the flow of gas through ukrainian pipelines and ensure supplies are not stolen - a charge kyiv denies .
russian and ukrainian officials on friday said they supported the eu observer plan , but both noted kyiv and moscow still have not agreed on gas pricing and terms between the two countries - the issue leading to the cut-off . briefing russian president dmitry medvedev on friday , gazprom chief alexei miller said there had been " no progress " on the price kyiv should pay for gas and charge for transit tariffs in 2009 . " the negotiations are practically serving no purpose , " miller told medvedev in the black sea resort town of sochi , where he flew directly from meetings with eu officials in brussels on thursday . gazprom and ukraine 's naftogaz had planned to sit for further face-to-face talks after the consultations in brussels .
but both sides only revived mutual accusations on friday . accusations stalling progress at noon in brussels , eu officials said that russian prime minister vladimir putin had vowed to reopen gas taps as soon as the mission , agreed in telephone conversations overnight , got under way . but almost simultaneously , the spokesman for russian gas monopolist gazprom , sergei kupryanov , accused ukraine of rejecting the deployment of russian experts - a precondition set by moscow for the resumption of gas supplies . " ukraine categorically refuses to include gazprom representatives and in overall agree with the proposal for the creation of an international multi-lateral monitoring commission , " he said , according to the news agency interfax . at the same moment , the head of ukrainian gas monopolist naftogaz , oleh dubina , told journalists in kyiv that russian negotiators were not interested in a deal . " we have the impression negotiators from gazprom do not have the authority to sign the agreement , " dubina said . gazprom stopped all natural gas shipments through ukraine on wednesday , endangering gas supplies to more than a dozen european nations .
russia provides roughly one quarter of the eu 's natural gas needs , and 80 per cent of that gas flowed to the eu through ukrainian pipelines until the embargo . czech prime minister mirek topolanek , whose country holds the rotating presidency of the eu , was expected to try and broker the final details of the mission during a visit to kyiv in the course of the afternoon . topolanek 's mission is intended to " discuss specific details of the functioning of the monitoring group and to make sure the observers are deployed immediately at points that are relevant for the transit of russian gas via ukraine to the eu , so that gas supplies can be restored as soon as possible , " an eu presidency statement said . many countries left in the cold bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people in bosnia are resorting to other methods of heating their homes eu member states in central and southern europe have already been hard hit by russia 's shut-off of all gas supplies through ukraine , with slovakia relying on gas supplies from poland and eu neighbour serbia seeking emergency help from germany , austria and hungary . that situation looks certain to last at least through the weekend , after russian and ukrainian experts said that there would be a technical delay of up to 66 hours between gazprom reopening supplies to europe and the first consignments of siberian gas reaching european customers . gas experts from eu member states met in brussels on friday to discuss emergency support for those countries hardest hit by the crisis .

the feline wandered onto the stage just and began rubbing up against the weatherman 's leg and waving its tail in front of the camera .
like a true professional , kachelmann was n't fazed by this surprise appearance .
he simply reached down and picked the cat , whose name is lupin , and finished his forecast without missing a beat .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- palm unveils smartphone at show bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 05:18 gmt , friday , 9 january 2009 palm unveils smartphone at show by mark ward bbc news technology correspondent , las vegas handheld computing veteran palm has unveiled its pre smartphone at ces .
the touchscreen handset runs a web-centric operating system that aims to help people organise and manage their many online contacts and identities .
the device is widely seen as a competitor to rival smartphones such as the iphone , blackberry , n97 and g1 .
the gadget will be available on the sprint network in the us before june 2009 .
palm has not said when it will debut in other nations .
palm showed off the pre at a lavish news conference at the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas .
online lives introducing the pre , jon rubinstein , executive chairman of palm , said the rise of the smartphone signalled a significant " transition " in what people expected from their handset .
rather than just take and make calls , he said , people wanted their phones to act as a co-ordinating centre for their online lives .
" the opportunity is to take all of that information wherever it is and put it all in one place - in your hands , " he said .
palm 's history meant it was well placed to create a gadget to fulfil this need , said mr rubinstein .
in the late 1990s palm was synonymous with handheld gadgets thanks to the success of its iconic palm pilot line and follow-on products such as the treo .
" the next wave is likely mobile devices and palm 's dna is mobile and always has been , " said mr rubinstein , who joined palm from apple where he was influential in creating the hugely popular ipod portable music player .
thumb swipe as well as a touchscreen that lets owners scroll through lists , zoom in on pictures or control media with a finger touch , the pre also has a " gesture area " below the screen on the lower part of the phone .
performing gestures , such as a thumb swipe , on this area owners perform other tasks , such as bringing up a main menu , without having to obscure what is on screen .
the device also has a slide out qwerty keyboard , removable battery , three megapixel camera and 8gb of memory on board .
the pre also comes with a " touchstone " so it can be recharged wirelessly .
doing the hard work onboard the pre is the palm web os - formerly called nova - that is based around common web technologies such as html and javascript .
this allows applications on the phone to run concurrently and also organises all the information accessed via the handset .
for instance , when users visit sites such as gmail , facebook and others the phone grabs copies of contacts then compiles a master address book of all the people someone knows and the ways to contact them .
' different places ' but , said palm boss ed colligan , the software does not force owners to mash all their contacts together .
" our lives live in different places on the net , " said mr colligan , " a lot of people do want to simplify their lives but they want to keep the info in those silos . "
he said the device was not intended to be connected and updated via a pc .
instead , he said , it assumes that it will connect to the net .
it can be linked to a pc to allow owners to transfer data or load content from partners .
also due is an applications store that will be populated with software from third-party developers .
distribution network despite the positive reception the pre won , mr colligan acknowledged that there was much more to making it a success than just making gadgets .
" this is a point in time , " said mr colligan , " we can celebrate for a day but the reality is that we have to ship the product and build our distribution network . "
already , he said , palm had drawn up plans for a whole product line that would be rolled out over the coming months .
all the devices would bear palm 's name and be wholly palm products , he said .
" if you do not make the hardware those kind of fundamental design things like the gesture area do not get incorporated into it , " he said .

online lives introducing the pre , jon rubinstein , executive chairman of palm , said the rise of the smartphone signalled a significant " transition " in what people expected from their handset .
rather than just take and make calls , he said , people wanted their phones to act as a co-ordinating centre for their online lives .
" the opportunity is to take all of that information wherever it is and put it all in one place - in your hands , " he said .
palm 's history meant it was well placed to create a gadget to fulfil this need , said mr rubinstein .
in the late 1990s palm was synonymous with handheld gadgets thanks to the success of its iconic palm pilot line and follow-on products such as the treo .
" the next wave is likely mobile devices and palm 's dna is mobile and always has been , " said mr rubinstein , who joined palm from apple where he was influential in creating the hugely popular ipod portable music player .
thumb swipe as well as a touchscreen that lets owners scroll through lists , zoom in on pictures or control media with a finger touch , the pre also has a " gesture area " below the screen on the lower part of the phone .
performing gestures , such as a thumb swipe , on this area owners perform other tasks , such as bringing up a main menu , without having to obscure what is on screen .
the device also has a slide out qwerty keyboard , removable battery , three megapixel camera and 8gb of memory on board .
the pre also comes with a " touchstone " so it can be recharged wirelessly .
doing the hard work onboard the pre is the palm web os - formerly called nova - that is based around common web technologies such as html and javascript .
this allows applications on the phone to run concurrently and also organises all the information accessed via the handset .
for instance , when users visit sites such as gmail , facebook and others the phone grabs copies of contacts then compiles a master address book of all the people someone knows and the ways to contact them .
' different places ' but , said palm boss ed colligan , the software does not force owners to mash all their contacts together .
" our lives live in different places on the net , " said mr colligan , " a lot of people do want to simplify their lives but they want to keep the info in those silos . "
he said the device was not intended to be connected and updated via a pc .
instead , he said , it assumes that it will connect to the net .
it can be linked to a pc to allow owners to transfer data or load content from partners .
also due is an applications store that will be populated with software from third-party developers .
distribution network despite the positive reception the pre won , mr colligan acknowledged that there was much more to making it a success than just making gadgets .
" this is a point in time , " said mr colligan , " we can celebrate for a day but the reality is that we have to ship the product and build our distribution network . "
already , he said , palm had drawn up plans for a whole product line that would be rolled out over the coming months .
all the devices would bear palm 's name and be wholly palm products , he said .
" if you do not make the hardware those kind of fundamental design things like the gesture area do not get incorporated into it , " he said .

the touchscreen handset runs a web-centric operating system that aims to help people organise and manage their many online contacts and identities .
the device is widely seen as a competitor to rival smartphones such as the iphone , blackberry , n97 and g1 .
the gadget will be available on the sprint network in the us before june 2009 .
palm has not said when it will debut in other nations .
palm showed off the pre at a lavish news conference at the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas .
online lives introducing the pre , jon rubinstein , executive chairman of palm , said the rise of the smartphone signalled a significant " transition " in what people expected from their handset .
rather than just take and make calls , he said , people wanted their phones to act as a co-ordinating centre for their online lives .
" the opportunity is to take all of that information wherever it is and put it all in one place - in your hands , " he said .
palm 's history meant it was well placed to create a gadget to fulfil this need , said mr rubinstein .
in the late 1990s palm was synonymous with handheld gadgets thanks to the success of its iconic palm pilot line and follow-on products such as the treo .
" the next wave is likely mobile devices and palm 's dna is mobile and always has been , " said mr rubinstein , who joined palm from apple where he was influential in creating the hugely popular ipod portable music player .
thumb swipe as well as a touchscreen that lets owners scroll through lists , zoom in on pictures or control media with a finger touch , the pre also has a " gesture area " below the screen on the lower part of the phone .
performing gestures , such as a thumb swipe , on this area owners perform other tasks , such as bringing up a main menu , without having to obscure what is on screen .
the device also has a slide out qwerty keyboard , removable battery , three megapixel camera and 8gb of memory on board .
the pre also comes with a " touchstone " so it can be recharged wirelessly .
doing the hard work onboard the pre is the palm web os - formerly called nova - that is based around common web technologies such as html and javascript .
this allows applications on the phone to run concurrently and also organises all the information accessed via the handset .
for instance , when users visit sites such as gmail , facebook and others the phone grabs copies of contacts then compiles a master address book of all the people someone knows and the ways to contact them .
' different places ' but , said palm boss ed colligan , the software does not force owners to mash all their contacts together .
" our lives live in different places on the net , " said mr colligan , " a lot of people do want to simplify their lives but they want to keep the info in those silos . "
he said the device was not intended to be connected and updated via a pc .
instead , he said , it assumes that it will connect to the net .
it can be linked to a pc to allow owners to transfer data or load content from partners .
also due is an applications store that will be populated with software from third-party developers .
distribution network despite the positive reception the pre won , mr colligan acknowledged that there was much more to making it a success than just making gadgets .
" this is a point in time , " said mr colligan , " we can celebrate for a day but the reality is that we have to ship the product and build our distribution network . "
already , he said , palm had drawn up plans for a whole product line that would be rolled out over the coming months .
all the devices would bear palm 's name and be wholly palm products , he said .
" if you do not make the hardware those kind of fundamental design things like the gesture area do not get incorporated into it , " he said .

the gadget will be available on the sprint network in the us before june 2009 .
palm has not said when it will debut in other nations .
palm showed off the pre at a lavish news conference at the venetian hotel and casino in las vegas .
online lives introducing the pre , jon rubinstein , executive chairman of palm , said the rise of the smartphone signalled a significant " transition " in what people expected from their handset .
rather than just take and make calls , he said , people wanted their phones to act as a co-ordinating centre for their online lives .
" the opportunity is to take all of that information wherever it is and put it all in one place - in your hands , " he said .
palm 's history meant it was well placed to create a gadget to fulfil this need , said mr rubinstein .
in the late 1990s palm was synonymous with handheld gadgets thanks to the success of its iconic palm pilot line and follow-on products such as the treo .
" the next wave is likely mobile devices and palm 's dna is mobile and always has been , " said mr rubinstein , who joined palm from apple where he was influential in creating the hugely popular ipod portable music player .
thumb swipe as well as a touchscreen that lets owners scroll through lists , zoom in on pictures or control media with a finger touch , the pre also has a " gesture area " below the screen on the lower part of the phone .
performing gestures , such as a thumb swipe , on this area owners perform other tasks , such as bringing up a main menu , without having to obscure what is on screen .
the device also has a slide out qwerty keyboard , removable battery , three megapixel camera and 8gb of memory on board .
the pre also comes with a " touchstone " so it can be recharged wirelessly .
doing the hard work onboard the pre is the palm web os - formerly called nova - that is based around common web technologies such as html and javascript .
this allows applications on the phone to run concurrently and also organises all the information accessed via the handset .
for instance , when users visit sites such as gmail , facebook and others the phone grabs copies of contacts then compiles a master address book of all the people someone knows and the ways to contact them .
' different places ' but , said palm boss ed colligan , the software does not force owners to mash all their contacts together .
" our lives live in different places on the net , " said mr colligan , " a lot of people do want to simplify their lives but they want to keep the info in those silos . "
he said the device was not intended to be connected and updated via a pc .
instead , he said , it assumes that it will connect to the net .
it can be linked to a pc to allow owners to transfer data or load content from partners .
also due is an applications store that will be populated with software from third-party developers .
distribution network despite the positive reception the pre won , mr colligan acknowledged that there was much more to making it a success than just making gadgets .
" this is a point in time , " said mr colligan , " we can celebrate for a day but the reality is that we have to ship the product and build our distribution network . "
already , he said , palm had drawn up plans for a whole product line that would be rolled out over the coming months .
all the devices would bear palm 's name and be wholly palm products , he said .
" if you do not make the hardware those kind of fundamental design things like the gesture area do not get incorporated into it , " he said .

advertisement see the footage of the rare , venomous mammal rare footage of one of the world 's most strange and elusive mammals has been captured by scientists .
large , and with a long , thin snout , the hispaniolan solenodon resembles an overgrown shrew ; it can inject passing prey with a venom-loaded bite .
little is known about the creature , which is found in the caribbean , but it is under threat from deforestation , hunting and introduced species .
researchers say conservation efforts are now needed .
the mammal was filmed in the summer of 2008 during a month-long expedition to the dominican republic - one of only two countries where this nocturnal , insect-eating animal -lrb- solenodon paradoxus -rrb- can be found -lrb- the other is haiti -rrb- .
it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world dr sam turvey , zsl the researchers from the durrell wildlife conservation trust and the ornithological society of hispaniola were able to take measurements and dna from the creature before it was released .
dr richard young , from durrell wildlife conservation trust , said : " my colleagues were excited and thrilled when they found it in the trap .
" but despite a month 's worth of trapping effort , they only ever caught a single individual . "
specialised teeth the hispaniolan solenodon is one of the creatures highlighted by the zoological society of london 's -lrb- zsl -rrb- edge of existence programme , which focuses its efforts on conservation plans for animals that are both endangered and evolutionarily distinctive .
dr sam turvey , a zsl researcher involved with the programme , told bbc news : " it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world .
" along with the other species of solenodon , which is found in cuba -lrb- solenodon cubanus -rrb- , it is the only living mammal that can actually inject venom into their prey through specialised teeth .
" the fossil record shows that some other now-extinct mammal groups also had so-called dental venom delivery systems .
so this might have been a more general ancient mammalian characteristic that has been lost in most modern mammals , and is only retained in a couple of very ancient lineages . "
a population was discovered living in a remote corner of haiti dr turvey and other scientists working for the edge programme recently discovered a population of solenodons living in a remote corner of haiti .
the researcher said that the team was surprised to find them ; previously it had been feared that the creatures had become extinct in this country because of extensive deforestation , recently introduced mongoose and dogs , and hunting by humans for food .
he said : " they are still incredibly vulnerable and fragile .
so it is really important to get back out there to work how how these animals are surviving . "
conservation efforts are now needed in both haiti and the dominican republic , the teams believe , but the first step would be to find out more about the animal .
dr young said : " we know little about its ecology , its behaviour , its population status , its genetics - and without that knowledge base it is really difficult to design effective conservation . "
the research will be undertaken by zsl 's edge programme , durrell , the ornithological society of hispaniola , the audubon society of haiti , and the dominican republic 's national zoological park and agency for protected areas and biodiversity .

advertisement see the footage of the rare , venomous mammal rare footage of one of the world 's most strange and elusive mammals has been captured by scientists .
large , and with a long , thin snout , the hispaniolan solenodon resembles an overgrown shrew ; it can inject passing prey with a venom-loaded bite .
little is known about the creature , which is found in the caribbean , but it is under threat from deforestation , hunting and introduced species .
researchers say conservation efforts are now needed .
the mammal was filmed in the summer of 2008 during a month-long expedition to the dominican republic - one of only two countries where this nocturnal , insect-eating animal -lrb- solenodon paradoxus -rrb- can be found -lrb- the other is haiti -rrb- .
it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world dr sam turvey , zsl the researchers from the durrell wildlife conservation trust and the ornithological society of hispaniola were able to take measurements and dna from the creature before it was released .
dr richard young , from durrell wildlife conservation trust , said : " my colleagues were excited and thrilled when they found it in the trap .
" but despite a month 's worth of trapping effort , they only ever caught a single individual . "
specialised teeth the hispaniolan solenodon is one of the creatures highlighted by the zoological society of london 's -lrb- zsl -rrb- edge of existence programme , which focuses its efforts on conservation plans for animals that are both endangered and evolutionarily distinctive .
dr sam turvey , a zsl researcher involved with the programme , told bbc news : " it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world .
" along with the other species of solenodon , which is found in cuba -lrb- solenodon cubanus -rrb- , it is the only living mammal that can actually inject venom into their prey through specialised teeth .
" the fossil record shows that some other now-extinct mammal groups also had so-called dental venom delivery systems .
so this might have been a more general ancient mammalian characteristic that has been lost in most modern mammals , and is only retained in a couple of very ancient lineages . "
a population was discovered living in a remote corner of haiti dr turvey and other scientists working for the edge programme recently discovered a population of solenodons living in a remote corner of haiti .
the researcher said that the team was surprised to find them ; previously it had been feared that the creatures had become extinct in this country because of extensive deforestation , recently introduced mongoose and dogs , and hunting by humans for food .
he said : " they are still incredibly vulnerable and fragile .
so it is really important to get back out there to work how how these animals are surviving . "
conservation efforts are now needed in both haiti and the dominican republic , the teams believe , but the first step would be to find out more about the animal .
dr young said : " we know little about its ecology , its behaviour , its population status , its genetics - and without that knowledge base it is really difficult to design effective conservation . "
the research will be undertaken by zsl 's edge programme , durrell , the ornithological society of hispaniola , the audubon society of haiti , and the dominican republic 's national zoological park and agency for protected areas and biodiversity .

large , and with a long , thin snout , the hispaniolan solenodon resembles an overgrown shrew ; it can inject passing prey with a venom-loaded bite .
little is known about the creature , which is found in the caribbean , but it is under threat from deforestation , hunting and introduced species .
researchers say conservation efforts are now needed .
the mammal was filmed in the summer of 2008 during a month-long expedition to the dominican republic - one of only two countries where this nocturnal , insect-eating animal -lrb- solenodon paradoxus -rrb- can be found -lrb- the other is haiti -rrb- . "
it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world " dr sam turvey , zsl the researchers from the durrell wildlife conservation trust and the ornithological society of hispaniola were able to take measurements and dna from the creature before it was released .
dr richard young , from durrell wildlife conservation trust , said : " my colleagues were excited and thrilled when they found it in the trap .
" but despite a month 's worth of trapping effort , they only ever caught a single individual . "
specialised teeth the hispaniolan solenodon is one of the creatures highlighted by the zoological society of london 's -lrb- zsl -rrb- edge of existence programme , which focuses its efforts on conservation plans for animals that are both endangered and evolutionarily distinctive .
dr sam turvey , a zsl researcher involved with the programme , told bbc news : " it is an amazing creature - it is one of the most evolutionary distinct mammals in the world .
" along with the other species of solenodon , which is found in cuba -lrb- solenodon cubanus -rrb- , it is the only living mammal that can actually inject venom into their prey through specialised teeth .
" the fossil record shows that some other now-extinct mammal groups also had so-called dental venom delivery systems .
so this might have been a more general ancient mammalian characteristic that has been lost in most modern mammals , and is only retained in a couple of very ancient lineages . "
dr turvey and other scientists working for the edge programme recently discovered a population of solenodons living in a remote corner of haiti .
the researcher said that the team was surprised to find them ; previously it had been feared that the creatures had become extinct in this country because of extensive deforestation , recently introduced mongoose and dogs , and hunting by humans for food .
he said : " they are still incredibly vulnerable and fragile .
so it is really important to get back out there to work how how these animals are surviving . "
conservation efforts are now needed in both haiti and the dominican republic , the teams believe , but the first step would be to find out more about the animal .
dr young said : " we know little about its ecology , its behaviour , its population status , its genetics - and without that knowledge base it is really difficult to design effective conservation . "
the research will be undertaken by zsl 's edge programme , durrell , the ornithological society of hispaniola , the audubon society of haiti , and the dominican republic 's national zoological park and agency for protected areas and biodiversity .

the main reasons given for absences were stress , depression , mental health issues and fatigue .
the highest average rates were recorded by workers in larne with 20 days a year , followed by carrickfergus , derry city council , moyle and craigavon .
magherafelt staff had the lowest rate , calling in sick eight days on average .
the sharpest rise occurred in ballymena council .
newry and mourne showed the biggest improvement since last year , cutting absenteeism from an average of 21 days to 15 since 2005 .
brian campfield of the public service union nipsa said the absentee levels sounded like " a staggering figure " but had to be assessed " in context of the overall workforce " .
" you have to remember that many council employees work outdoors in all weathers , and they are subject to quite a bit of pressure from the public from different sectors of society , " he said .
" many of the jobs have a lot of stress involved . "
the report , by chief local government auditor john buchanan , found there was no discernable pattern in absentee rates , but said the management of absenteeism did vary between councils .
" we recommend that councils with high and rising absenteeism rates should review their own management practices and benchmark these against those councils with low and falling absenteeism rates , " it said .

the main reasons given for absences were stress , depression , mental health issues and fatigue .
the highest average rates were recorded by workers in larne with 20 days a year , followed by carrickfergus , derry city council , moyle and craigavon .
magherafelt staff had the lowest rate , calling in sick eight days on average .
the sharpest rise occurred in ballymena council .
newry and mourne showed the biggest improvement since last year , cutting absenteeism from an average of 21 days to 15 since 2005 .
brian campfield of the public service union nipsa said the absentee levels sounded like " a staggering figure " but had to be assessed " in context of the overall workforce " .
" you have to remember that many council employees work outdoors in all weathers , and they are subject to quite a bit of pressure from the public from different sectors of society , " he said .
" many of the jobs have a lot of stress involved . "
the report , by chief local government auditor john buchanan , found there was no discernable pattern in absentee rates , but said the management of absenteeism did vary between councils .
" we recommend that councils with high and rising absenteeism rates should review their own management practices and benchmark these against those councils with low and falling absenteeism rates , " it said .

the main reasons given for absences were stress , depression , mental health issues and fatigue .
the highest average rates were recorded by workers in larne with 20 days a year , followed by carrickfergus , derry city council , moyle and craigavon .
magherafelt staff had the lowest rate , calling in sick eight days on average .
the sharpest rise occurred in ballymena council .
newry and mourne showed the biggest improvement since last year , cutting absenteeism from an average of 21 days to 15 since 2005 .
brian campfield of the public service union nipsa said the absentee levels sounded like " a staggering figure " but had to be assessed " in context of the overall workforce " .
" you have to remember that many council employees work outdoors in all weathers , and they are subject to quite a bit of pressure from the public from different sectors of society , " he said .
" many of the jobs have a lot of stress involved . "
the report , by chief local government auditor john buchanan , found there was no discernable pattern in absentee rates , but said the management of absenteeism did vary between councils .
" we recommend that councils with high and rising absenteeism rates should review their own management practices and benchmark these against those councils with low and falling absenteeism rates , " it said .

many of the community-based organisations offering savings and loans and other financial help say membership has jumped in recent months .
those contacted by bbc wales say hundreds of people have joined since the credit crunch began to bite .
the total membership of credit unions has trebled over the past decade .
there are 30 credit unions in wales , with more than 45,000 members , offering a range of financial services depending on their size . "
we 've had a lot of people coming to us because they 've been refused credit from the banks " rina clarke , robert owen montgomeryshire credit union any area or organisation can form a credit union but they have to operate within their own communities - known as the " common bond " .
the robert owen montgomeryshire credit union in newtown , powys , has 2,000 members , with 160 joining in the last four months , and has seen an 8 % rise in loan applications .
manager rina clarke said : " we 've had a lot of people coming to us because they 've been refused credit from the banks .
" we 've had an increase in personal and business applications , and this has led to an increase in membership .
every week we have several new members .
what credit unions do credit unions are financial co-operatives owned and controlled by their members members pool their savings together which then provide funds from which loans can be made besides loans and savings , some also offer other financial services such as current accounts profits go towards developing the business or are returned to members they are regulated and authorised by the financial services authority , the same regulator as banks and building societies they are managed and controlled by a volunteer board of directors there are 30 in wales with more than 45,000 members there are around 500 in the uk with some 500,000 members " they are not guaranteed a loan , but we look at the applications differently to the banks and base decisions on income and expenditure .
" people have an in-depth interview and have to save with us for a period beforehand .
" we also offer financial advice and hold people 's hands really , and try to educate them in some financial literacy . "
delyth shearing , manager of merthyr tydfil borough credit union , said she and her colleagues had been " extremely busy " for about 18 months .
since last july , membership has increased by 187 , which is up on the same period in 2007 .
" we 've seen an increase in people slow to repay their loans , " said ms shearing .
" there 's also been an increase in people seeking advice about coping with debt , those wanting advice about dealing with rent arrears , and a rise in inquiries for larger loans to consolidate debt .
" the sort of people we are dealing with have suffered redundancy , a cut in working hours or a change to the benefits they receive . "
david collins , who manages wrexham and borough credit union , said : " we have 350 members and 60 of those have joined since december .
that figure could be related to christmas , but in the last three months there 's been a sharp rise in loan applications , " he said . "
we have 350 members and 60 of those have joined since december " david collins , wrexham and borough credit union " people want somewhere safe to put their money and credit unions are ideal .
we 're not linked to the bank of england , we 're not affected by stock market fluctuations - we 're totally independent . "
dave williams of llandudno and district credit union , which covers conwy county , said although the organisation was growing anyway , the credit crunch had led to more people getting in touch about loans .
" unfortunately people have perhaps built up a not very favourable credit history , " he said .
" all of a sudden , bang , those people who were perhaps a bit rash in the past found all of a sudden nobody wants to know about them .
" banks are restricting people 's overdrafts and not allowing them any more money . "
he said the credit union would soon be the first in wales to offer current accounts to people who would not otherwise have one .
mark lyonett , chief executive of the association of british credit unions , said : " certainly the credit crunch has made more people come to talk to credit unions about their borrowing and saving needs , " he said .
savers and borrowers " but credit unions have been growing for the last 10 years and this is an added impetus to growth . "
katija dew of the wales co-operative centre , which supports credit unions , has found they are attracting savers as well as borrowers .
she said : " there are a lot more people wanting to borrow from credit unions but there 's a move to more people saving as well .
" people are realising they ca n't rely on credit quite as much as they have done in the past . "
credit unions work as low-risk savings and loans providers , frequently for less well-off customers , but ms dew said they attracted people from all sectors of society .
" some people do invest in a credit union purely as part of their ethical outlook to support something they feel is local and doing good , " she said .
brian capon of the british bankers ' association said there was plenty of room in the market for both banks and credit unions , and they complemented one another .

responses from 132 hospital trusts to a freedom of information request found that 15 % still used at least one open-plan , mixed-sex ward .
others had curtains dividing the sexes , falling short of advice that there should be solid full-height partitions the government said progress was being made but admitted there was more to do .
it is degrading to patients joyce robins , of patient concern send us your comments labour pledged to end mixed-sex accommodation in both its 1997 and 2001 manifestos .
by 2006 ministers were claiming it had been achieved in 99 % of cases , but patient surveys soon showed this to be untrue .
a government report in 2007 accepted 15 % of trusts still had not achieved it .
under the government 's definition of mixed-sex accommodation , patients should be kept in bays divided at the very least by fixed full-height partitions .
patients should also not be expected to walk past others of the opposite sex to go to washing or toilet facilities either .
intensive care and a & e departments are not included for practical reasons .
failing the tories ' freedom of information request on mixed-sex accommodation - the second of its kind carried out in the past year - was answered by 132 hospital trusts and 55 mental health trusts .
for the latter , there was just one -lrb- 2 % -rrb- that had a mixed-sex ward .

more from today programme as well as the use of " nightingale " wards , 16 % of hospital and 8 % of mental health centres relied on curtains .
and nearly a third were failing on the requirement that patients should not walk past those of the opposite sex when they were going to use washing or toilet facilities .
the issue of mixed-sex accommodation has become a priority for the tories .
last year they promised they would fund a huge rise in single rooms , guaranteeing expectant mothers and mental health patients their own rooms .
shadow health secretary andrew lansley said : " patients have enough to worry about without having to suffer the indignity of being placed in accommodation that affords them too little privacy .
" despite hearing promise after promise to end the scandal of mixed-sex wards , we have not seen the necessary action and they continue to blight our hospitals . "
sharing toilets joyce robins , of patient concern , said : " it is scandalous that mixed-sex wards are still being used .
" it is degrading to patients .
hospitals are just too busy . "
dr anthony halperin , from the patients association , said the government had not given the full facts , with 30 % of all wards sharing toilet facilities .
" men and women find that very embarrassing , and it nullifies having single-sex wards . "
he said mixed-sex wards were about keeping beds occupied all the time , and were simply a " question of cost " .

as she sits on the bed in al-quds hospital in gaza city , their mother fatima al-shamouny , 36 , tries to comfort them .
but as she tells their - and her own - story , she sobs too .
the boys were found on wednesday , with their dead father and unconscious mother nearby , four days after the emergency services said they began trying to reach the neighbourhood .
they were among 30 people palestinian red crescent workers said they evacuated from zeitoun , a south-eastern suburb of gaza city , on wednesday .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said the paramedics found " shocking " scenes of wounded people huddled together in houses among dead bodies , weak after having had no food or water for several days .
in one home , the agency said , four small children were found sitting close to their dead mothers , " too weak to stand on their own " .
it is not clear if sameh and ahmad were in that particular house - it may be that the unconscious fatima was initially thought to be dead - but she says she and her toddlers were among those who had a long wait for help .
survivors ' accounts the icrc has accused the israeli military of failing to live up to its obligations under international law to facilitate the evacuation or to care for the wounded .
the agency said it had been requesting safe passage for its ambulances to access the neighbourhood since 3 january , but only received permission to do so from the israeli defence forces -lrb- idf -rrb- four days later .
the details of exactly what happened at the shamouny family compound are still sketchy .
survivors have told the bbc that 26 of the extended family 's 65 members died in israeli military operations .
we spent days without food , without water - the wounded were bleeding for four days wael faris al-shamouny their accounts of shelling , and then ground troops surrounding their homes , can not be independently verified .
fatima , who was wounded in the chest , says two of her sons , her husband , her aunt , her uncle and her brother-in-law were all killed .
" one of my sons crawled to our neighbour 's house - he was injured - and he called some of the local radio stations to ask for help .
but the help arrived late .
everybody had died , " she said .
" on the third day , i passed out .
i do n't know what happened until i found myself here in the hospital , " she said .
wael faris al-shamouny , 39 , another member of the extended family , smoked and sipped black coffee as he sat on the floor in the hospital corridor .
he says he lost five sons and his wife , and believes some of the dead may have survived if given medical treatment earlier .
" we tried to help them , but we did n't have first aid things in our house .
we spent days without food , without water - the wounded were bleeding for four days , " he said .
" the ambulances came and they saved who they saved .
there are still pieces of my wife , my sons and my cousins ' bodies in the house . "
icrc criticism the icrc said the wounded had to be transported about a kilometre on a hand-pulled donkey cart because large earth walls erected by the israeli army had made it impossible to bring ambulances into the neighbourhood .
the minimum is to treat these -lsb- injured -rsb- people , to feed these people , give them water , and keep them in a safe place katarina ritz icrc 's head of mission in jerusalem gaza ' human shields ' criticised in pictures : gaza conflict israelis back gaza action - for now conflict hits egyptian smugglers katarina ritz , the icrc 's head of mission in jerusalem , said experienced palestinian emergency workers wept at the scenes they were confronted with .
she said israeli troops were within about 100m of the houses in question , and that the icrc believes the soldiers " must have been aware " of the presence of the wounded people , because of repeated requests from aid agencies for access .
under international law , she said , even if there are security concerns meaning the injured can not be evacuated , " the minimum is to treat these people , to feed these people , give them water , and keep them in a safe place " .
the israeli military said it was investigating the case .
it said it is " engaged in a battle with the hamas terrorist organisation that has deliberately used palestinian civilians as human shields " .
and it stressed it works in " close co-operation with international aid organisations during the fighting , so that civilians can be provided with assistance " .
' difficult ' co-operation earlier in the week , an icrc spokeswoman told the bbc attempts to co-ordinate safe passage for ambulances were so slow that people were dying as they waited .
not all ambulance drivers in gaza have been waiting for co-ordination with the israeli military , and health officials in gaza say 10 paramedics have been killed trying to rescue the wounded since the israeli operation began .
israeli defence ministry spokesman peter lerner said that co-ordinating the movements of ambulances has been " extremely difficult because of heavy gunfire " .
he said that even during the three-hour lull israel declared to allow humanitarian operations , hamas militants continued to shoot at israeli forces .
outside the hospital , as fatima shamouny told her story , dozens of people gathered as thursday 's icrc-led convoy of ambulances prepared to leave .
they came with addresses where they believed injured people were trapped .
one man 's hands shook so much with fear that he had to ask for help writing the directions down .
finally , the convoy received clearance , and drove away .
it was headed back to zeitoun , where the icrc said there were reports of more injured people stranded , and another area in northern gaza , which icrc workers had not even reached yet .

as she sits on the bed in al-quds hospital in gaza city , their mother fatima al-shamouny , 36 , tries to comfort them .
but as she tells their - and her own - story , she sobs too .
the boys were found on wednesday , with their dead father and unconscious mother nearby , four days after the emergency services said they began trying to reach the neighbourhood .
they were among 30 people palestinian red crescent workers said they evacuated from zeitoun , a south-eastern suburb of gaza city , on wednesday .
the international committee of the red cross -lrb- icrc -rrb- said the paramedics found " shocking " scenes of wounded people huddled together in houses among dead bodies , weak after having had no food or water for several days .
in one home , the agency said , four small children were found sitting close to their dead mothers , " too weak to stand on their own " .
it is not clear if sameh and ahmad were in that particular house - it may be that the unconscious fatima was initially thought to be dead - but she says she and her toddlers were among those who had a long wait for help .
survivors ' accounts the icrc has accused the israeli military of failing to live up to its obligations under international law to facilitate the evacuation or to care for the wounded .
the agency said it had been requesting safe passage for its ambulances to access the neighbourhood since 3 january , but only received permission to do so from the israeli defence forces -lrb- idf -rrb- four days later .
the details of exactly what happened at the shamouny family compound are still sketchy .
survivors have told the bbc that 26 of the extended family 's 65 members died in israeli military operations .
we spent days without food , without water - the wounded were bleeding for four days wael faris al-shamouny their accounts of shelling , and then ground troops surrounding their homes , can not be independently verified .
fatima , who was wounded in the chest , says two of her sons , her husband , her aunt , her uncle and her brother-in-law were all killed .
" one of my sons crawled to our neighbour 's house - he was injured - and he called some of the local radio stations to ask for help .
but the help arrived late .
everybody had died , " she said .
" on the third day , i passed out .
i do n't know what happened until i found myself here in the hospital , " she said .
wael faris al-shamouny , 39 , another member of the extended family , smoked and sipped black coffee as he sat on the floor in the hospital corridor .
he says he lost five sons and his wife , and believes some of the dead may have survived if given medical treatment earlier .
" we tried to help them , but we did n't have first aid things in our house .
we spent days without food , without water - the wounded were bleeding for four days , " he said .
" the ambulances came and they saved who they saved .
there are still pieces of my wife , my sons and my cousins ' bodies in the house . "
icrc criticism the icrc said the wounded had to be transported about a kilometre on a hand-pulled donkey cart because large earth walls erected by the israeli army had made it impossible to bring ambulances into the neighbourhood .
the minimum is to treat these -lsb- injured -rsb- people , to feed these people , give them water , and keep them in a safe place katarina ritz icrc 's head of mission in jerusalem gaza ' human shields ' criticised in pictures : gaza conflict israelis back gaza action - for now conflict hits egyptian smugglers katarina ritz , the icrc 's head of mission in jerusalem , said experienced palestinian emergency workers wept at the scenes they were confronted with .
she said israeli troops were within about 100m of the houses in question , and that the icrc believes the soldiers " must have been aware " of the presence of the wounded people , because of repeated requests from aid agencies for access .
under international law , she said , even if there are security concerns meaning the injured can not be evacuated , " the minimum is to treat these people , to feed these people , give them water , and keep them in a safe place " .
the israeli military said it was investigating the case .
it said it is " engaged in a battle with the hamas terrorist organisation that has deliberately used palestinian civilians as human shields " .
and it stressed it works in " close co-operation with international aid organisations during the fighting , so that civilians can be provided with assistance " .
' difficult ' co-operation earlier in the week , an icrc spokeswoman told the bbc attempts to co-ordinate safe passage for ambulances were so slow that people were dying as they waited .
not all ambulance drivers in gaza have been waiting for co-ordination with the israeli military , and health officials in gaza say 10 paramedics have been killed trying to rescue the wounded since the israeli operation began .
israeli defence ministry spokesman peter lerner said that co-ordinating the movements of ambulances has been " extremely difficult because of heavy gunfire " .
he said that even during the three-hour lull israel declared to allow humanitarian operations , hamas militants continued to shoot at israeli forces .
outside the hospital , as fatima shamouny told her story , dozens of people gathered as thursday 's icrc-led convoy of ambulances prepared to leave .
they came with addresses where they believed injured people were trapped .
one man 's hands shook so much with fear that he had to ask for help writing the directions down .
finally , the convoy received clearance , and drove away .
it was headed back to zeitoun , where the icrc said there were reports of more injured people stranded , and another area in northern gaza , which icrc workers had not even reached yet .
