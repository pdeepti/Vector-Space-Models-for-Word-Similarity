4 , hamburg would be prepared to release croatia striker olic in the winter break if they can get podolski in exchange .
hamburg would have to pay some 7 million euros -lrb- 9.7 million dollars -rrb- for podolski plus olic who would otherwise join bayern on a free transfer at the end of the season .
the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "
both bayern and hamburg are in dubai for winter training camps and are staying at hotels a few minutes drive from each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could link up with bayern sooner than expected bayern are said to want at least 10 million euros for podolski who would be interested in rejoining his former club cologne .
hoeness confirmed saturday that olic , 29 , is set to join bayern at the end of the season on a three-year contract .
however , hamburg coach martin jol said in dubai he could not rule out the olic transfer " taking place sooner . "
podolski , who has been recovering from the flu , will fly out to join the bayern squad in dubai on monday .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann said " uli hoeness will be trying to wrap up talks in january so that everything is sorted out to the satisfaction of lukas and the club . "
other players ' futures on the table klinsmann meanwhile said sunday he would also be seeking talks in dubai with argentinian midfielder jose sosa over the player 's future .
klinsmann would like to release the midfielder on loan to enable him to get more match practice .
" it 's a very difficult situation with jose to get him more match practice so that he can develop further .
the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "
us striker landon donovan will be hoping to impress his claim to stay at bayern after arriving on loan from la galaxy .
a decision will be taken in march on whether the deal may be extended .
donovan told the bayern web site said he was ready for the challenge against fellow strikers luca toni , miroslav klose and podolski .

i can learn lots from them , " he said .
" at the same time , i do believe i can bring qualities of my own to the team .
i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .
i know i 'm ready for it now . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.01.2009 german government at odds over new stimulus package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure projects are part of the new stimulus package , but are tax cuts ?
leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg would have to pay some 7 million euros -lrb- 9.7 million dollars -rrb- for podolski plus olic who would otherwise join bayern on a free transfer at the end of the season .
the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "

the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "
us striker landon donovan will be hoping to impress his claim to stay at bayern after arriving on loan from la galaxy .
a decision will be taken in march on whether the deal may be extended .
donovan told the bayern web site said he was ready for the challenge against fellow strikers luca toni , miroslav klose and podolski .

i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .

greece , meanwhile , has seen a drop of nearly one-third in its gas supplies .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .
two somali journalists who were assisting them were also kidnapped , but there has been no word of their whereabouts . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german finance minister warns against new " growth bubble " german finance minister peer steinbrueck has warned against cutting interest rates to spur the country 's economy , a move he insists would lead to a hazardous " growth bubble " in germany .
-lrb- 30.12.2008 -rrb- media : germany stimulus package smaller than expected german papers reported on wednesday , dec .
24 , that berlin is planning a package of measures to help the country fight recession worth 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , less than the 40 billion euros reported earlier .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .

"
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .

ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .

civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions .

" other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "

that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .

six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .

4 , hamburg would be prepared to release croatia striker olic in the winter break if they can get podolski in exchange .
hamburg would have to pay some 7 million euros -lrb- 9.7 million dollars -rrb- for podolski plus olic who would otherwise join bayern on a free transfer at the end of the season .
the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "
both bayern and hamburg are in dubai for winter training camps and are staying at hotels a few minutes drive from each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could link up with bayern sooner than expected bayern are said to want at least 10 million euros for podolski who would be interested in rejoining his former club cologne .
hoeness confirmed saturday that olic , 29 , is set to join bayern at the end of the season on a three-year contract .
however , hamburg coach martin jol said in dubai he could not rule out the olic transfer " taking place sooner . "
podolski , who has been recovering from the flu , will fly out to join the bayern squad in dubai on monday .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann said " uli hoeness will be trying to wrap up talks in january so that everything is sorted out to the satisfaction of lukas and the club . "
other players ' futures on the table klinsmann meanwhile said sunday he would also be seeking talks in dubai with argentinian midfielder jose sosa over the player 's future .
klinsmann would like to release the midfielder on loan to enable him to get more match practice .
" it 's a very difficult situation with jose to get him more match practice so that he can develop further .
the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "

in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming .

the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .

since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .

" this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what is the left party ?
where did it come from ?
and what are its policies ? december 1989 .
the border between east and west germany has been open for a month .
the berlin wall has fallen , taking down with it an entire political system .
the east german parliament has deleted from the gdr constitution the paragraph that gave the socialist unity party the leading role in deciding the country 's politics .
party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 05.01.2009 israel rejects ceasefire talk as eu toils to align peace efforts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel rejected eu calls for a ceasfire and said it would decide when to stop operations israel has rejected calls by visiting eu diplomats for an immediate ceasefire in gaza .
meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .

the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .

party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .

but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .

"

defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .

in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .

assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .

that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.01.2009 international crackdown on somali piracy gaining pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed and serious : german marines have been called into action as part of the force a battle is being waged against the somalian pirates who 've been wreaking havoc in the gulf of aden .
but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .
two somali journalists who were assisting them were also kidnapped , but there has been no word of their whereabouts . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their advance sparked clashes with local hamas fighters .
according to palestinian officials , at least 50 palestinians have been killed since the ground offensive began saturday , while more than 200 have been injured .
since israel nine days ago launched its operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - more than 520 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,500 injured .
a hamas official said monday that a delegation of the militant group would attend talks in egypt , news agency reuters reported .

" in all wars there is a humanitarian crisis and certainly more than imaginable in gaza . " we have to return to the political process , the palestinian parties must speak to each other and there must be a palestinian state .

"
a european envoy meanwhile hopes to broker peace . israeli ground troops took control of areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
their advance sparked clashes with local hamas fighters .
according to palestinian officials , at least 50 palestinians have been killed since the ground offensive began saturday , while more than 200 have been injured .
since israel nine days ago launched its operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - more than 520 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,500 injured .
a hamas official said monday that a delegation of the militant group would attend talks in egypt , news agency reuters reported .
french condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says diplomacy can end the conflict also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy traveled to the middle east for talks in egypt , the west bank and israel aimed at achieving a diplomatic solution , before engaging in further discussions in syria and lebanon on tuesday .
in an interview to be published monday the french president told three lebanese newspapers that france denounced the israeli ground offensive . but he added that hamas bore " a heavy responsibility " for the suffering of palestinians in gaza . " i want to say again here that we condemn with the same firmness -lrb- hamas ' -rrb- continuing rocket fire , which is an unacceptable provocation , " said sarkozy . steinmeier : arms must be ' controlled ' german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday that israel 's ground offensive had effectively nullified any hopes of an early cessation of fighting . he called for speedy efforts to ensure that " the dramatic humanitarian situation " in gaza did not deteriorate and to allow urgently needed relief supplies to be distributed to the population . at the same time , steinmeier said steps should be introduced that would provide permanent guarantees for the security of israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there must be an end to arms smuggling into the gaza strip it was not enough for hamas militants to cease firing missiles at the jewish state , he said .
there was also a need for a reliable control mechanism at crossing points with gaza to halt arms smuggling , he added . war must stop , eu mission says an eu delegation to the middle east - including czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and swedish foreign minister carl bildt - also took a hard stance sunday against both hamas and israeli attacks , calling for an immediate end to hostilities . after meeting with egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit , schwarzenberg said palestinian " rocket attacks and on the other side the shelling and the bombing of the gaza strip " had to stop , though he offered no concrete solution to bring about a ceasefire . kouchner , meanwhile , highlighted the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement against the hostilities as a sign that the international community was powerless to stop the cross-border attacks of both warring parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner , right , says there is no military solution " this war must completely stop , everyone knows it .
we know what has to be done but no one can do it , " he told a media conference in cairo . call for a palestinian state " i think that there will be no military solution but the protagonists must both be convinced of this . " unfortunately our efforts have been unsuccessful and there is ... an unbearable humanitarian situation , " kouchner said .
" in all wars there is a humanitarian crisis and certainly more than imaginable in gaza . " we have to return to the political process , the palestinian parties must speak to each other and there must be a palestinian state . " kouchner said that hamas made " a deliberate choice not only to resume rocket fire but also to refuse to meet " the rival fatah faction of palestinian president mahmud abbas for egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks . israeli ground offensive on sunday , the israeli army disconnected the north , including gaza city , from the southern region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say some 40 israeli tanks are moving towards the southern city of khan younis hamas , which has kept one israeli soldier captive in gaza since june 2005 as a bargaining chip to free palestinian militants from israeli prisons , has threatened to use the ground offensive to capture more israeli soldiers .
israel radio reported monday that the israeli army foiled one such attempt by hamas fighters the previous day .
at least five israeli soldiers were moderately injured overnight , israel radio reported , and an unknown number of palestinians .
one israeli soldier was killed and some 31 injured in the fighting sunday .
four israelis have also died by palestinian rocket attacks since the israeli operation began dec .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .

civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .
people are hungry , people are cold and people feel fear all the time . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "

that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamburg would have to pay some 7 million euros -lrb- 9.7 million dollars -rrb- for podolski plus olic who would otherwise join bayern on a free transfer at the end of the season .
the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could link up with bayern sooner than expected bayern are said to want at least 10 million euros for podolski who would be interested in rejoining his former club cologne .
hoeness confirmed saturday that olic , 29 , is set to join bayern at the end of the season on a three-year contract .
however , hamburg coach martin jol said in dubai he could not rule out the olic transfer " taking place sooner . "
podolski , who has been recovering from the flu , will fly out to join the bayern squad in dubai on monday .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann said " uli hoeness will be trying to wrap up talks in january so that everything is sorted out to the satisfaction of lukas and the club . "
other players ' futures on the table klinsmann meanwhile said sunday he would also be seeking talks in dubai with argentinian midfielder jose sosa over the player 's future .
klinsmann would like to release the midfielder on loan to enable him to get more match practice .
" it 's a very difficult situation with jose to get him more match practice so that he can develop further .
the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "
us striker landon donovan will be hoping to impress his claim to stay at bayern after arriving on loan from la galaxy .
a decision will be taken in march on whether the deal may be extended .
donovan told the bayern web site said he was ready for the challenge against fellow strikers luca toni , miroslav klose and podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national soccer player landon donovan had a short spell in germany in 2005 " training with such classy players makes you a better player yourself .
i can learn lots from them , " he said .
" at the same time , i do believe i can bring qualities of my own to the team .
i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .
i know i 'm ready for it now . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a european envoy meanwhile hopes to broker peace . israeli ground troops took control of areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
their advance sparked clashes with local hamas fighters .
according to palestinian officials , at least 50 palestinians have been killed since the ground offensive began saturday , while more than 200 have been injured .
since israel nine days ago launched its operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - more than 520 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,500 injured .
a hamas official said monday that a delegation of the militant group would attend talks in egypt , news agency reuters reported .
french condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says diplomacy can end the conflict also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy traveled to the middle east for talks in egypt , the west bank and israel aimed at achieving a diplomatic solution , before engaging in further discussions in syria and lebanon on tuesday .
in an interview to be published monday the french president told three lebanese newspapers that france denounced the israeli ground offensive . but he added that hamas bore " a heavy responsibility " for the suffering of palestinians in gaza . " i want to say again here that we condemn with the same firmness -lrb- hamas ' -rrb- continuing rocket fire , which is an unacceptable provocation , " said sarkozy . steinmeier : arms must be ' controlled ' german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday that israel 's ground offensive had effectively nullified any hopes of an early cessation of fighting . he called for speedy efforts to ensure that " the dramatic humanitarian situation " in gaza did not deteriorate and to allow urgently needed relief supplies to be distributed to the population . at the same time , steinmeier said steps should be introduced that would provide permanent guarantees for the security of israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there must be an end to arms smuggling into the gaza strip it was not enough for hamas militants to cease firing missiles at the jewish state , he said .
there was also a need for a reliable control mechanism at crossing points with gaza to halt arms smuggling , he added . war must stop , eu mission says an eu delegation to the middle east - including czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and swedish foreign minister carl bildt - also took a hard stance sunday against both hamas and israeli attacks , calling for an immediate end to hostilities . after meeting with egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit , schwarzenberg said palestinian " rocket attacks and on the other side the shelling and the bombing of the gaza strip " had to stop , though he offered no concrete solution to bring about a ceasefire . kouchner , meanwhile , highlighted the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement against the hostilities as a sign that the international community was powerless to stop the cross-border attacks of both warring parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner , right , says there is no military solution " this war must completely stop , everyone knows it .
we know what has to be done but no one can do it , " he told a media conference in cairo . call for a palestinian state " i think that there will be no military solution but the protagonists must both be convinced of this . " unfortunately our efforts have been unsuccessful and there is ... an unbearable humanitarian situation , " kouchner said .
" in all wars there is a humanitarian crisis and certainly more than imaginable in gaza . " we have to return to the political process , the palestinian parties must speak to each other and there must be a palestinian state . " kouchner said that hamas made " a deliberate choice not only to resume rocket fire but also to refuse to meet " the rival fatah faction of palestinian president mahmud abbas for egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks . israeli ground offensive on sunday , the israeli army disconnected the north , including gaza city , from the southern region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say some 40 israeli tanks are moving towards the southern city of khan younis hamas , which has kept one israeli soldier captive in gaza since june 2005 as a bargaining chip to free palestinian militants from israeli prisons , has threatened to use the ground offensive to capture more israeli soldiers .
israel radio reported monday that the israeli army foiled one such attempt by hamas fighters the previous day .
at least five israeli soldiers were moderately injured overnight , israel radio reported , and an unknown number of palestinians .
one israeli soldier was killed and some 31 injured in the fighting sunday .
four israelis have also died by palestinian rocket attacks since the israeli operation began dec .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .

the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .

" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .

i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he is accompanied by his country 's special envoy for energy , vaclav bartuska , and officials from the office of eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .

since the row began , russia and ukraine have issued conflicting accounts on who is to blame for the shut-off and the extent to which supplies to europe would be affected .
reports from eu member states in central and eastern europe have also given contradictory versions of the current state of gas supplies , leaving eu authorities groping for accurate information .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

4 , hamburg would be prepared to release croatia striker olic in the winter break if they can get podolski in exchange .
hamburg would have to pay some 7 million euros -lrb- 9.7 million dollars -rrb- for podolski plus olic who would otherwise join bayern on a free transfer at the end of the season .
the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "
both bayern and hamburg are in dubai for winter training camps and are staying at hotels a few minutes drive from each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could link up with bayern sooner than expected bayern are said to want at least 10 million euros for podolski who would be interested in rejoining his former club cologne .
hoeness confirmed saturday that olic , 29 , is set to join bayern at the end of the season on a three-year contract .
however , hamburg coach martin jol said in dubai he could not rule out the olic transfer " taking place sooner . "
podolski , who has been recovering from the flu , will fly out to join the bayern squad in dubai on monday .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann said " uli hoeness will be trying to wrap up talks in january so that everything is sorted out to the satisfaction of lukas and the club . "
other players ' futures on the table klinsmann meanwhile said sunday he would also be seeking talks in dubai with argentinian midfielder jose sosa over the player 's future .
klinsmann would like to release the midfielder on loan to enable him to get more match practice .
" it 's a very difficult situation with jose to get him more match practice so that he can develop further .
the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "
us striker landon donovan will be hoping to impress his claim to stay at bayern after arriving on loan from la galaxy .
a decision will be taken in march on whether the deal may be extended .
donovan told the bayern web site said he was ready for the challenge against fellow strikers luca toni , miroslav klose and podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national soccer player landon donovan had a short spell in germany in 2005 " training with such classy players makes you a better player yourself .
i can learn lots from them , " he said .
" at the same time , i do believe i can bring qualities of my own to the team .
i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .
i know i 'm ready for it now . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a european envoy meanwhile hopes to broker peace . israeli ground troops took control of areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
their advance sparked clashes with local hamas fighters .
according to palestinian officials , at least 50 palestinians have been killed since the ground offensive began saturday , while more than 200 have been injured .
since israel nine days ago launched its operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - more than 520 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,500 injured .
a hamas official said monday that a delegation of the militant group would attend talks in egypt , news agency reuters reported .
french condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says diplomacy can end the conflict also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy traveled to the middle east for talks in egypt , the west bank and israel aimed at achieving a diplomatic solution , before engaging in further discussions in syria and lebanon on tuesday .
in an interview to be published monday the french president told three lebanese newspapers that france denounced the israeli ground offensive . but he added that hamas bore " a heavy responsibility " for the suffering of palestinians in gaza . " i want to say again here that we condemn with the same firmness -lrb- hamas ' -rrb- continuing rocket fire , which is an unacceptable provocation , " said sarkozy . steinmeier : arms must be ' controlled ' german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday that israel 's ground offensive had effectively nullified any hopes of an early cessation of fighting . he called for speedy efforts to ensure that " the dramatic humanitarian situation " in gaza did not deteriorate and to allow urgently needed relief supplies to be distributed to the population . at the same time , steinmeier said steps should be introduced that would provide permanent guarantees for the security of israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there must be an end to arms smuggling into the gaza strip it was not enough for hamas militants to cease firing missiles at the jewish state , he said .
there was also a need for a reliable control mechanism at crossing points with gaza to halt arms smuggling , he added . war must stop , eu mission says an eu delegation to the middle east - including czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and swedish foreign minister carl bildt - also took a hard stance sunday against both hamas and israeli attacks , calling for an immediate end to hostilities . after meeting with egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit , schwarzenberg said palestinian " rocket attacks and on the other side the shelling and the bombing of the gaza strip " had to stop , though he offered no concrete solution to bring about a ceasefire . kouchner , meanwhile , highlighted the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement against the hostilities as a sign that the international community was powerless to stop the cross-border attacks of both warring parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner , right , says there is no military solution " this war must completely stop , everyone knows it .
we know what has to be done but no one can do it , " he told a media conference in cairo . call for a palestinian state " i think that there will be no military solution but the protagonists must both be convinced of this . " unfortunately our efforts have been unsuccessful and there is ... an unbearable humanitarian situation , " kouchner said .
" in all wars there is a humanitarian crisis and certainly more than imaginable in gaza . " we have to return to the political process , the palestinian parties must speak to each other and there must be a palestinian state . " kouchner said that hamas made " a deliberate choice not only to resume rocket fire but also to refuse to meet " the rival fatah faction of palestinian president mahmud abbas for egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks . israeli ground offensive on sunday , the israeli army disconnected the north , including gaza city , from the southern region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say some 40 israeli tanks are moving towards the southern city of khan younis hamas , which has kept one israeli soldier captive in gaza since june 2005 as a bargaining chip to free palestinian militants from israeli prisons , has threatened to use the ground offensive to capture more israeli soldiers .
israel radio reported monday that the israeli army foiled one such attempt by hamas fighters the previous day .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .

so what is the left party ?
where did it come from ?
and what are its policies ? december 1989 .
the border between east and west germany has been open for a month .
the berlin wall has fallen , taking down with it an entire political system .
the east german parliament has deleted from the gdr constitution the paragraph that gave the socialist unity party the leading role in deciding the country 's politics .
party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 05.01.2009 german government at odds over new stimulus package großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : infrastructure projects are part of the new stimulus package , but are tax cuts ?
leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .

the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .

palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .

"
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .

french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.01.2009 international crackdown on somali piracy gaining pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed and serious : german marines have been called into action as part of the force a battle is being waged against the somalian pirates who 've been wreaking havoc in the gulf of aden .
but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .
two somali journalists who were assisting them were also kidnapped , but there has been no word of their whereabouts . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the delegation is also due to meet officials from russian gas monopoly gazprom on monday or tuesday , depending on their respective schedules .
gazprom has already sent a delegation of top officials to europe to present its side of the dispute .
the mission is headed by czech industry minister martin riman .
he is accompanied by his country 's special envoy for energy , vaclav bartuska , and officials from the office of eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
the eu mission is intended to " keep up intense contacts " with the two sides , whose row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills led gazprom to shut off gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday , jan .
1 , a czech spokesman said .
brussels seeks solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom ceo alexei miller is to meet with eu officials monday or tuesday meanwhile , eu diplomats later monday are to hold an emergency meeting in brussels to exchange information over the gas crisis .
eu energy experts are set to meet in brussels on friday .
since the row began , russia and ukraine have issued conflicting accounts on who is to blame for the shut-off and the extent to which supplies to europe would be affected .
reports from eu member states in central and eastern europe have also given contradictory versions of the current state of gas supplies , leaving eu authorities groping for accurate information .
the fact-finding mission had been planned for later this week , but was brought forward to avoid a clash with the orthodox christmas on wednesday , jan .
7 , a czech spokesman said .
supplies affected in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : natural gas shortages have been widespread throughout the balkans gazprom said ukrainian authorities had shut down the orlovka compressor station which supplies gas to the balkans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .

" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "

that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
a european envoy meanwhile hopes to broker peace . israeli ground troops took control of areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
their advance sparked clashes with local hamas fighters .
according to palestinian officials , at least 50 palestinians have been killed since the ground offensive began saturday , while more than 200 have been injured .
since israel nine days ago launched its operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - more than 520 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,500 injured .
a hamas official said monday that a delegation of the militant group would attend talks in egypt , news agency reuters reported .
french condemnation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy says diplomacy can end the conflict also on monday , french president nicolas sarkozy traveled to the middle east for talks in egypt , the west bank and israel aimed at achieving a diplomatic solution , before engaging in further discussions in syria and lebanon on tuesday .
in an interview to be published monday the french president told three lebanese newspapers that france denounced the israeli ground offensive . but he added that hamas bore " a heavy responsibility " for the suffering of palestinians in gaza . " i want to say again here that we condemn with the same firmness -lrb- hamas ' -rrb- continuing rocket fire , which is an unacceptable provocation , " said sarkozy . steinmeier : arms must be ' controlled ' german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said sunday that israel 's ground offensive had effectively nullified any hopes of an early cessation of fighting . he called for speedy efforts to ensure that " the dramatic humanitarian situation " in gaza did not deteriorate and to allow urgently needed relief supplies to be distributed to the population . at the same time , steinmeier said steps should be introduced that would provide permanent guarantees for the security of israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says there must be an end to arms smuggling into the gaza strip it was not enough for hamas militants to cease firing missiles at the jewish state , he said .
there was also a need for a reliable control mechanism at crossing points with gaza to halt arms smuggling , he added . war must stop , eu mission says an eu delegation to the middle east - including czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , french foreign minister bernard kouchner , eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and swedish foreign minister carl bildt - also took a hard stance sunday against both hamas and israeli attacks , calling for an immediate end to hostilities . after meeting with egyptian foreign minister ahmed abul gheit , schwarzenberg said palestinian " rocket attacks and on the other side the shelling and the bombing of the gaza strip " had to stop , though he offered no concrete solution to bring about a ceasefire . kouchner , meanwhile , highlighted the failure of the un security council to agree on a statement against the hostilities as a sign that the international community was powerless to stop the cross-border attacks of both warring parties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french foreign minister bernard kouchner , right , says there is no military solution " this war must completely stop , everyone knows it .
we know what has to be done but no one can do it , " he told a media conference in cairo . call for a palestinian state " i think that there will be no military solution but the protagonists must both be convinced of this . " unfortunately our efforts have been unsuccessful and there is ... an unbearable humanitarian situation , " kouchner said .
" in all wars there is a humanitarian crisis and certainly more than imaginable in gaza . " we have to return to the political process , the palestinian parties must speak to each other and there must be a palestinian state . " kouchner said that hamas made " a deliberate choice not only to resume rocket fire but also to refuse to meet " the rival fatah faction of palestinian president mahmud abbas for egyptian-mediated reconciliation talks . israeli ground offensive on sunday , the israeli army disconnected the north , including gaza city , from the southern region . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reports say some 40 israeli tanks are moving towards the southern city of khan younis hamas , which has kept one israeli soldier captive in gaza since june 2005 as a bargaining chip to free palestinian militants from israeli prisons , has threatened to use the ground offensive to capture more israeli soldiers .
israel radio reported monday that the israeli army foiled one such attempt by hamas fighters the previous day .
at least five israeli soldiers were moderately injured overnight , israel radio reported , and an unknown number of palestinians .
one israeli soldier was killed and some 31 injured in the fighting sunday .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .

and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .

the report said the deal would benefit both sides in many ways , including the fact that both players would still be eligible to play in the champions league -lrb- bayern -rrb- and uefa cup -lrb- hamburg -rrb- .
lucrative sponsorship deal for hamburg hamburg in addition have just extended their contract with main sponsors emirates for an improved deal bringing in some 7 million euros a year , abendblatt said .
bayern general manager uli hoeness is quoted as telling welt , " if podolski comes to us and says he wants to go to hsv -lrb- hamburg -rrb- then we can talk about it . "
both bayern and hamburg are in dubai for winter training camps and are staying at hotels a few minutes drive from each other .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ivica olic could link up with bayern sooner than expected bayern are said to want at least 10 million euros for podolski who would be interested in rejoining his former club cologne .
hoeness confirmed saturday that olic , 29 , is set to join bayern at the end of the season on a three-year contract .
however , hamburg coach martin jol said in dubai he could not rule out the olic transfer " taking place sooner . "
podolski , who has been recovering from the flu , will fly out to join the bayern squad in dubai on monday .
bayern coach juergen klinsmann said " uli hoeness will be trying to wrap up talks in january so that everything is sorted out to the satisfaction of lukas and the club . "
other players ' futures on the table klinsmann meanwhile said sunday he would also be seeking talks in dubai with argentinian midfielder jose sosa over the player 's future .
klinsmann would like to release the midfielder on loan to enable him to get more match practice .
" it 's a very difficult situation with jose to get him more match practice so that he can develop further .
the competition is very , very great .
but it depends on what he wants to do . "
us striker landon donovan will be hoping to impress his claim to stay at bayern after arriving on loan from la galaxy .
a decision will be taken in march on whether the deal may be extended .
donovan told the bayern web site said he was ready for the challenge against fellow strikers luca toni , miroslav klose and podolski .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us national soccer player landon donovan had a short spell in germany in 2005 " training with such classy players makes you a better player yourself .
i can learn lots from them , " he said .
" at the same time , i do believe i can bring qualities of my own to the team .
i 'm a different type of player compared to luca , miro and lukas .
i do a lot of work off the ball and at a high pace . "
donovan , 26 , said he had improved greatly since an apprenticeship with bayer leverkusen and a brief spell with the club in 2005 .
" i 've grown up , especially mentally .
i 'm more experienced and mentally stronger , and i know what to expect here , " he said .
" back then in leverkusen , i was n't ready for germany and the bundesliga .
i thought for many months about the decision to come back , and spoke to lots of people .
i know i 'm ready for it now . " dpa news agency -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what is the left party ?
where did it come from ?
and what are its policies ? december 1989 .
the border between east and west germany has been open for a month .
the berlin wall has fallen , taking down with it an entire political system .
the east german parliament has deleted from the gdr constitution the paragraph that gave the socialist unity party the leading role in deciding the country 's politics .
party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .

the delegation is also due to meet officials from russian gas monopoly gazprom on monday or tuesday , depending on their respective schedules .
gazprom has already sent a delegation of top officials to europe to present its side of the dispute .
the mission is headed by czech industry minister martin riman .
he is accompanied by his country 's special envoy for energy , vaclav bartuska , and officials from the office of eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
the eu mission is intended to " keep up intense contacts " with the two sides , whose row over contracts and allegedly unpaid bills led gazprom to shut off gas deliveries to ukraine on thursday , jan .

brussels seeks solutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gazprom ceo alexei miller is to meet with eu officials monday or tuesday meanwhile , eu diplomats later monday are to hold an emergency meeting in brussels to exchange information over the gas crisis .
eu energy experts are set to meet in brussels on friday .
since the row began , russia and ukraine have issued conflicting accounts on who is to blame for the shut-off and the extent to which supplies to europe would be affected .
reports from eu member states in central and eastern europe have also given contradictory versions of the current state of gas supplies , leaving eu authorities groping for accurate information .

bulgaria 's state gas distributor bulgargaz said russian gas transit volumes via bulgaria to turkey and macedonia were lower as a result of the standoff .
supplies to romania were 30 percent lower , while the czech republic saw a 5 percent drop sunday , though the government in prague said gas levels had returned to normal monday .
croatia said natural gas deliveries from russia had dropped 7.5 percent as a result of the dispute , but added that supplies to domestic customers would not be affected .
greece , meanwhile , has seen a drop of nearly one-third in its gas supplies .
both sides threaten court action with no immediate end in sight , both moscow and kyiv have said they would bring cases against each other at an arbitration court in stockholm that handles commercial disputes .
gazprom chief executive alexei miller will meet russian prime minister vladimir putin on monday for talks on the standoff , a russian government spokeswoman said the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas passing through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .

but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .
two somali journalists who were assisting them were also kidnapped , but there has been no word of their whereabouts . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what is the left party ?
where did it come from ?
and what are its policies ? december 1989 .
the border between east and west germany has been open for a month .
the berlin wall has fallen , taking down with it an entire political system .
the east german parliament has deleted from the gdr constitution the paragraph that gave the socialist unity party the leading role in deciding the country 's politics .
party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 05.01.2009 international crackdown on somali piracy gaining pace großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : armed and serious : german marines have been called into action as part of the force a battle is being waged against the somalian pirates who 've been wreaking havoc in the gulf of aden .
but as international warships thwart more attacks , the question arises of what to do with the pirates they capture . the first days of 2009 have seen a spate of pirate attacks off the somalian coast , but a crackdown on rampant piracy by eu nations as well as the us , china , india , malaysia , turkey and russia means many of the bandits ' hijacking attempts are being thwarted .
the international maritime bureau -lrb- imb -rrb- piracy reporting center in kuala lumpur has confirmed five attacks so far this year .
the first was on new year 's day when a malaysian warship helped indian seamen fight off heavily-armed bandits attempting to board an oil tanker .
the second came just an hour later , when attackers managed to hijack an egyptian cargo ship .
several hours later a greek bulk carrier was fired on , but the captain took evasive measures and managed to escape , said noel choong , the head of the imb reporting center .
on january 2 , at least five pirates attacked a german tanker , firing their machine guns at the ship which had 21 crew members on board .
" the captain increased the ship 's speed along with other manoeuvres and managed to escape , " choong told news agency afp .
in a fifth incident , a greek tanker was fired on but the pirates fled when a spanish aircraft arrived at the scene .
danish , french forces capture pirates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu marines have been hunting pirates since december other incidents have not yet been confirmed by the imb .
the danish navy said one of its anti-piracy warships came to the rescue of a dutch cargo ship on friday and rescued five pirates after they were forced into the water .
the dutch foreign ministry has not yet reached a decision on the fate of the pirates , who continue to be held onboard the danish navy vessel .
also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .
two somali journalists who were assisting them were also kidnapped , but there has been no word of their whereabouts . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

also on friday , french forces handed over eight pirates to somali authorities after they responded to a distress signal from a panamanian cargo ship being pursued by bandits .
and on sunday , a french warship foiled a further two hijacking attempts on cargo vessels , intercepting 19 pirates who will also be transferred to somali authorities , the french president 's office said .
france has been particularly active in the fight against piracy in the vital shipping lanes that link europe to asia .
since last april , french forces have arrested 29 pirates .
foreign trials are risky some are in france awaiting trial .
but the pirates picked up on friday were delivered to security personnel in puntland - a semi-autonomous region that has become a base for the pirates earning millions of dollars in ransoms .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : suspected pirates may have links to puntland officials some analysts say that bringing the pirates to puntland is pointless as officials there are complicit in the attacks .
but puntland authorities deny any involvement and point to some 96 pirates in the region 's jails .
" there is a diplomatic agreement whereby the somali authorities are committed to prosecuting and punishing -lrb- pirates -rrb- , " said christophe prazuck , spokesman for the french armed forces .
some nations say trying pirates abroad is also problematic as they might face the prospect of extraditing them to somalia where piracy carries the death penalty .
british , spanish journalists freed in a separate development , two journalists who were in somalia to report on piracy for england 's daily telegraph were released on sunday after almost six weeks in captivity .
british writer colin freeman and spanish photographer jose cendon were seized on november 26 on thier way to the airport in bosasso , puntland 's economic capital .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .
people are hungry , people are cold and people feel fear all the time . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .

but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .

" the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .

leaders of germany 's coalition government meet monday to draft a second economic stimulus package .
but deep divisions on the best way forward are evident . it was never a match made in heaven , the conservatives and social democrats that make up germany 's grand coalition government .
but now as it hammers out a second stimulus plan to help the country weather the worst of the global financial meltdown , severe differences are emerging threaten to detail the economic rescue plan . the meeting on monday , jan .
5 , follows up on one in december to further pin down what steps the government will take to keep the economy afloat .
but the question of tax cuts and whether or not they are needed has even traditional allies at loggerheads . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst seehofer of the csu wants tax relief chancellor angela merkel , head of the christian democrats , had said she would not cut taxes as part of a stimulus package .
she is facing re-election this fall and had hoped to run on a promise of tax relief .
she and her finance minister also did not want to endanger the government 's medium-term goal of balancing the budget . but members of her own conservative coalition , particularly politicians from the bavarian sister party , the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , are demanding that tax rates fall , and have vowed to reject any stimulus package unless they get their wish . " the position of the csu is that we can not envision a growth package that does not include tax relief , " horst seehofer , head of the bavarian party , told the suedeutsche zeitung daily .
the party says tax cuts will get notoriously stingy german consumers back out to the stores to spend . that voice is countered by the left-of-center social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , who have refused to make tax cuts part of a new stimulus package . " we are heading into the negotiations with a clear position : the spd says no to tax cuts , " andreas nahles , a deputy leader of the party , told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
the party argues that germans will simply save any additional income they get from tax reductions . second go-round merkel had been reluctant for weeks to even put forward a second stimulus package .
berlin was one of the first governments in europe to spend to revive a slowing economy , and in november , it agreed on a package it says is worth 31 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel and steinbrueck have just said no to tax cuts - up to now but that was widely criticized as not being enough in face of the magnitude of the crisis .
and critics accused berlin of exaggerating the size of the package , saying it really represented about 12 billion euros worth of new spending . the new package is expected to be worth around 25 billion euros -lrb- $ 34.71 billion -rrb- and will include new spending on schools and infrastructure projects . in a meeting in late december , state officials were asked to bring back concrete proposals for projects that could be part of the package .
while the outlines could be agreed upon at monday 's meeting , the measures will likely not be finalized until another meeting scheduled for jan .
12 or even later in the month . merkel has seemed to soften her stance on the tax cut issue after weeks of acrimonious debate .
but not everybody is confident tax cuts will do much good , including the vice president of the european central bank , lucas papademos . " i am skeptical that in times of exceptional uncertainty and low confidence , economic activity will really benefit from a temporary tax relief , " he told the german finance magazine wirtschaftswoche . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

meanwhile , the eu struggles to coordinate its own peace efforts with those of french president nicolas sarkozy 's parallel mission . " we are fighting with terror and we are not reaching an agreement with terror , " she said , in reference to the islamist hamas rulers in gaza .
israel , she said , wanted the world to let it " conduct the war against terrorism until we decide to stop , " adding that the aim was to change the " equation " whereby hamas could fire rockets at the jewish state and not get a response .
in contrast , a delegation of eu diplomats meeting on monday in the egyptian resort town of sharm el-sheikh with egyptian president hosni mubarak reiterated calls for an immediate end to israel 's offensive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu delegates first met with president mubarak " we presented the israeli foreign minister with the view of the european union that a ceasefire should be established as soon as possible as ... the rockets have to stop , " czech foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency , told reporters in a joint media conference .
" we are not sharing the view that a ceasefire is only possible if all ... aims of the israeli actions are achieved , " he said .
" we do think that the ceasefire should be as early as possible . "
following talks in egypt , the eu delegation which also includes eu foreign commissioner benita ferrero-waldner and the foreign ministers of france and sweden , departed for further stops in jerusalem , ramallah and amman .
sarkozy on parallel mission parallel to the delegation visit , french president nicolas sarkozy is also in the region , traveling in his capacity as co-president of the union for the mediterranean .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy said france has a particular responsibility but as sarkozy has just relinquished the eu presidency , his visit has raised eyebrows in brussels , where some observers interpret it as signalling french mistrust in czech abilities to handle such a delicate mission .
that speculation grew at the weekend after a czech government spokesman described israel 's land invasion of the gaza strip as " defensive " - a label which contradicted earlier french statements that israel 's bombardment of the strip had been disproportionate .
the spokesman later retracted his words and offered to resign , but not before reports that the eu was divided over gaza had spread widely in the media .
diplomats in brussels on monday were keen to play down the idea of a split , but they insisted that the czech-led eu visit should not be eclipsed by sarkozy 's mission .
" the eu mission is the centre of action , " european commission spokesman amadeu altafaj said .
the aim of both missions is to broker a truce between israel and hamas , ensure the access of humanitarian aid to gaza and re-launch the peace process between israel and palestinians .
israel outlines conditions for ceasefire israel launched " operation cast lead " on december 27 with the declared aim of halting rocket fire against southern israel and smashing hamas ' military strength .
more than 520 palestinians have been killed in the offensive .
israel 's " fundamental principles " for ending the offensive include " substantially destroying " hamas ' military power , deterring hamas from firing rockets into southern israel and creating a mechanism to prevent hamas from rearming through smuggling tunnels linking gaza and egypt , a senior israeli official said . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what . " other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .

" other eu officials have said that while eu authorities do monitor the amount of gas entering at the bloc 's borders , there is no independent monitoring system to check on the supply from russia to ukraine . russian authorities have accused ukraine of " stealing " gas meant for europe while ukraine says that gazprom is not providing enough for supplies to be assured . transit shipments blocked meanwhile , ukraine has blocked transit shipment of russian natural gas to europe , escalating the acrimonious energy dispute between the two countries , ukrainian media reported monday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : naftogaz ukrainy exercised its power and banned transits executives from ukrainian natural gas monopolist naftogaz ukrainy refused late sunday evening to receive 15 million cubic meters of russian natural gas per day in the ukrainian gas pipeline network , citing absence of a contract to do so , korrespondent magazine reported . the volume barred was small relative to the overall volume of russian gas still transiting ukraine en route to european consumers , currently some 310 million cubic meters per day , according to a channel 5 television news report . the 15 million cubic meters , had it gone through , would have been an increase over the standard winter volumes of gas shipped by the russian natural gas monopolist gazprom to europe , aimed primarily at giving european energy companies more gas needed for heating as severe cold weather moves through europe . the ukrainian refusal to sanction an increase in russian gas shipped to europe - under normal circumstances a routine matter handled by russian and ukrainian energy technicians - marked the first active refusal by ukraine to sanction a russian increase in natural gas exports to europe since the onset of the latest natural gas crisis between the two countries . the current russo-ukrainian energy conflict came to a head on the first day of 2009 , when a gas shipment contract between the two countries became ineffective . naftogaz officials on monday said the 15 million cubic meter shipment planned by gazprom could not legally be received into ukraine , as a kiev court on sunday banned the ukrainian state-owned firm from moving russian gas for the price of 1.6 dollars for 1,000 cubic meters of gas over 100 kilometers .
that is the contract shipping price for 2008 , according to an interfax news agency reported . ukraine demanding more money in new deals the ukrainian reduction came after four days of threats by ukraine to reduce shipments of russian gas to europe if a new gas trade contract is not signed soon . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yushchenko risks angering the eu in his bid for more cash ukrainian president viktor yushchenko has said that the 2008 gas transit shipment price of 1.6 dollars is unacceptable , and must be increased in a new gas shipment contract . gazprom squarely opposes the ukrainian position , with russian company 's managers saying the transit shipment price charged russia by ukraine is fixed by other contracts effective through 2010 , and is not subject to negotiation . gas transit pricing is only one of several issues dividing moscow and kiev in the conflict .
other key disagreements include the price of russian gas sold to ukraine , possible payment of hundreds of millions of dollars of penalty fees by ukraine to russia , and possible siphoning of russian gas by ukraine during the first days of 2009 . the terms of natural gas transfers from russia to and through ukraine are critical to both countries ' economies .
natural gas exports are russia 's single largest export earner .
and cheap natural gas supplies are critical to the competitiveness of ukraine 's steel and chemical industries , sectors long considered by economists in the former soviet republic to be the main engines of ukraine 's now-ailing economy . both countries currently are holding hard-line positions in the dispute , with gazprom chairman aleksei miller demanding ukraine agree to a natural gas price higher than those prevailing in europe , and his naftogaz counterpart oleh dubina declaring ukraine has gas reserves of its own sufficient to outlast any russian embargo , even if it meant halting all gas shipments to europe . a lengthy standoff between ukraine and russia over natural gas , with a potential total stop to russian gas exports to europe , could have a devastating effect on european energy markets .
roughly one quarter of europe 's natural gas imports come from russia , and 80 per cent of russian natural gas exported to europe gets to market via ukrainian pipelines . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 05.01.2009 russia to increase gas cuts to ukraine in spiralling tit-for-tat großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin , here with president dmitri medvedev -lrb- l -rrb- , agreed with gazprom 's planned retaliation russia says it will further cut gas to ukraine by 65 million cubic meters per day , the amount it says kiev is stealing from eu clients further downstream .
some eu countries reported decreased supplies for a second day . gazprom chief executive alexei miller proposed the measure while briefing prime minister vladimir putin on the standoff since the company shut off supplies to ukraine on january 1 over non-payments and a pricing dispute . " good , i agree .
let 's begin the cuts from today , " putin was reported to have responded . miller said gazprom would instead increase gas deliveries to europe through belarus and its blue-stream pipeline under the black sea . the news came after russia accused ukraine on monday of refusal to ship additional volumes of russian gas via its pipelines as the deepening dispute over gas transit tariffs and pricing began to threaten supplies to european customers . russian gas makes up one-quarter of the european union 's needs , 80 percent of which travels through ukraine . the new cuts would lower supplies transiting through ukraine to some 250 million cubic meters per day . in answer to gazprom 's claim that ukraine stole over 25 million cubic metres of gas intended for european customers from sunday to monday , ukraine 's courts annulled its transit agreement with gazprom . it ruled the contracts lasting until 2010 invalid because they had been signed by an official from the state-controlled firm naftogaz , who was not authorized by the government to agree to such deals . earlier , gazprom said ukraine had closed a way station providing gas to the balkans . " i ca n't predict how long we will be able to cope with the current volume received , but ... the situation is worrying , " dimitar gogov , head of bulgarian state gas monopoly bulgargaz , was quoted by news agency itar-tass as saying .
supplies to the country dropped by 15 percent , bulgargaz said . following meetings in paris on monday , gazprom 's deputy chairman alexander medvedev reaffirmed pledges to meet commitments " by any means " to european customers . the eu is heavily reliant on russian gas , which passes through ukrainian pipelines for its energy needs .
in early 2006 , a similar russo-ukrainian dispute caused disruptions and price spikes across much of europe . feeding the stand-off are long-simmering political tensions between the two post-soviet neighbors . moscow resents moves by ukraine 's pro-western leadership to join nato and its support for georgia during that country 's war with russia in august . by monday evening , there was no sign of negotiations restarting in the deadlock and both parties threatened to bring their complaints to european courts . eu president czech republic hit for second day the czech republic 's natural gas deliveries dropped for the second day , according to martin chalupsky , a spokesman for the country 's leading gas importer , rwe transgas , who said the firm received 9.5 per cent less gas than ordered for the day . he said that the drop amounted to 1.7 million cubic meters of gas , or 2 percent of country 's daily consumption .
he said the reduction would have no impact on czech consumers . " as the drop it so small we are able to cover these shortfalls by raising supplies from underground storage tanks , " chalupsky told the dpa news agency . he said the firm had enough gas for two months if daily delivery drops of 5 to 20 per cent would continue amid current freezing conditions . " we are convinced that we will cover the whole winter season with storage supplies , " he added . the company , which commands a 71 percent share on the czech market , recorded the first delivery drop of 5 per cent on sunday , four days after russia 's gas export monopolist gazprom turned off gas supplies to ukraine . the european union 's eastern members have issued conflicting reports on gas delivery rates since friday . the eu , which is chaired by the czech republic until june 30 , has so far rejected calls to broker what it calls a " commercial dispute " between the two neighbors .
the bloc has however strongly urged both countries to reach a deal and renew full gas supplies to the 27-member bloc . poland , romania , hungary and slovakia also reported fluctuations and pressure drops of up to 30 percent in gas pumps , but all said they had enough gas to meet demand . the hungarian minister responsible for energy matters said late monday that ukraine had informed the hungarian government of its intention to reduce gas flow to hungary by almost a quarter . speaking to the press after meeting with the prime minister , csaba molnar said a large portion of that gas was earmarked for serbia and bosnia .
he warned that deliveries to those countries might be affected if ukraine goes ahead with the reduction . eu sees no immediate threat to gas supplies the eu commission said monday there was no immediate threat to natural gas supplies in europe despite the drops in supply . " there have been some irregularities but there is no substantial disruption of supply to member states at this point of time , " a spokesman for the eu 's executive arm said , making a similar assurance to industry . despite the reassurances , eu envoys were to hold a hastily-arranged meeting in brussels on the dispute later monday while an eu fact-finding delegation was heading to kiev to discuss the problem with ukrainian officials . although eu countries are heavily reliant on natural gas imports from russia , the bloc has tried to avoid being sucked into the role of arbiter . it has described the crisis - sparked by charges that ukraine has failed to pay bills owed to russian gas monopoly gazprom - as a strictly bilateral commercial dispute . russia provides around 40 percent of the gas imported by the eu , accounting for about a quarter of the bloc 's overall gas consumption , with most of this transiting pipelines through ukraine . gas stocks high as europe enters period of strong demand eu commission spokesman ferran tarradellas told reporters in brussels that gas stocks were high in europe , though they would come under strain because of the cold weather . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as winter sets in , the eu hopes its gas stocks will last " the level of the stocks is quite high , " he assured .
" this is why we are confident that there is going to be no problem to supply in the coming weeks for consumers in europe . " natural gas supplies have been affected in romania , bulgaria , the czech republic - which holds the eu 's rotating presidency - and poland . warsaw says that its shortfall in gas transiting ukraine is being compensated by a greater supply of russian gas via another pipeline through belarus . radek honzak , spokesman for the czech eu presidency , said it had been possible to compensate for any losses though other routes as well , through norway and the czech republic . tarradellas repeated the european commission 's assertion that the problem is a bilateral one for moscow and kiev to sort out themselves , while stressing that brussels was calling for a swift end to the dispute and insists on the contracted supply of gas to europe . " it is a commercial dispute and it has to be solved by the two parties , " insisted tarradellas , spokesman for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs .
" it is a bilateral issue between ukraine and russia and we are not going to come into evaluate who is responsible for what .

hamas said in a statement that its fighters had fired missiles at seven tanks in the same district .
the islamic jihad movement said several of its members were killed in the fighting .
israeli military sources confirmed that troops were involved in heavy clashes in that area .
flares lit up the skies over the blacked-out neighborhood .
assault helicopters were also seen .
palestinians said israeli shelling killed at least 29 gazan civilians in the strip , 17 of them children from three families the israeli army refused to give updated casualty figures from the day 's fighting , saying a toll would only be released once a day , in the evening .
but according to israeli media reports , which could not therefore be confirmed , some 55 soldiers have been wounded since saturday night , when the troops first crossed into the gaza strip in the second stage of operation " cast lead , " following a week of incessant air attack .
on sunday , one israeli soldier was killed .
ceasefire calls rebuffed by israel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign minister livni says israel will decide when to stop israeli foreign minister tzipi livni rebuffed european union calls for a ceasefire , saying at a joint news conference with eu representatives that while israel did not request world countries to help it fight hamas , it wanted them " to let us continue -lrb- fighting -rrb- until we decide we 've achieved our aims . "
she said israel was fighting to create a " new equation " whereby it would no longer act with restraint when hamas fired rockets from the gaza strip .
defense minister ehud barak said monday , as he prepared to brief the knesset foreign affairs and defense committee , that the gaza offensive would continue since israel had yet to achieve its objectives .
french president nicolas sarkozy was also due in israel for talks with officials , as the international community kept up its pressure for a ceasefire in the fighting , which began december 27 , when israel , after a week of massive rocket barrages from the gaza strip on southern israeli towns and cities following the end of a nervous six- month truce , began a campaign of airstrikes at gaza targets .
barak said monday that gaza city was partially surrounded by israeli troops , who on sunday took up positions which effectively cut the salient into two .
local residents said tanks moved into the city 's zaytoun neighborhood from a base they set up at a former jewish settlement , netzarim , south of the metropolis .
occupying a hill overlooking gaza city and the camp , they also moved toward the eastern outskirts of jabaliya , north of the city and one of the most crowded refugee camps in the enclave .
the troops ' advance sparked heavy clashes with local hamas fighters .
palestinian officials reveal gaza toll according to palestinian officials , since the start of the ground offensive began after darkness fell on saturday , at least 50 palestinians have been killed .
more than 200 have been injured .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gaza has been reduced to rubble by israel 's assault during the fighting monday , a tank shell destroyed a house during fighting in zaytoun neighborhood before dawn , killing 13 members of one family , assamouni , including the father , mother and eight children aged four to 15 , hospital officials said .
ambulances were able to reach the house only after daylight , witnesses said .
a naval shell later also struck a house in western gaza city 's beach refugee camp monday morning , killing a father , mother and five children of another family , the abu aishais , the chief of the emergency room of gaza city 's shifa hospital , haythem dababish , told the dpa news agency .
in beit hanoun , in northern gaza city near the border with israel , four more civilians died when a tank shell hit a mourning tent set up near the home of a paramedic killed sunday , the town 's hospital said .
in the evening , an israeli airstrike on eastern gaza city killed a mother and four children .
keeping up the pressure , israeli fighter jets meanwhile struck some 30 more targets in the coastal enclave overnight , the military said .
israeli ground troops , who entered the strip late saturday have also taken control of some areas from which palestinian militants have been firing rockets at southern israel .
nonetheless , rockets continued to land monday , with about 30 striking various locations in israel , including one which slammed into a kindergarten , which was empty at the time , in the port city of ashdod , about 30 kilometers north of the strip .
since israel nine days ago launched operation " cast lead " - aimed at curbing seven years of rocket and mortar attacks against its southern towns and villages - 537 palestinians have been killed and at least 2,600 injured , 800 of the critically .
four israelis - three civilians and a soldier - have been killed in the 480 rockets and mortars which have been launched from the salient since the operation began .
also , 119 civilians have been wounded , in addition to many more who have been treated for shock .
meanwhile , the humanitarian situation in the gaza strip is quickly worsening according to residents .
civilians without electricity , with little water and food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conditions for civilians in gaza are deteriorating fast residents of gaza city , who have been without electricity for days , say they have only small amounts of drinking water .
with even candles now a scarce commodity , gaza city residents sit in the dark - many of them in winter coats as they keep windows open to avoid glass shards flying inside their homes from a possible nearby blast .
hospitals are running on unreliable emergency generators .
on top of that , with the large influx of casualties - unprecedented in at least five decades of the conflict - those hospitals are in urgent need of blood units , anesthetics , strong painkillers , tetanus vaccines and even body bags and sheets , according to the red cross .
the salient 's power plant - supplying large parts of gaza city and the north of the strip - has shut down for lack of industrial fuel .
six out of 10 power lines from israel and one of two power lines from egypt , which supply the rest of the strip , have been damaged in the israeli strikes .
many types of food are hard to get buy , including bread .
only two bakeries remain open in gaza city , with queues stretching all the way down the street .
after venturing outdoors and waiting in line for hours on end , each customer can get one plastic bag with 50 small pita breads .
prices have nearly doubled since the offensive began .
large parts of the strip also have no tap water , as power blackout mean pumps are not working .
a few supermarkets remain open .
but many basic items , including dairy products and toilet paper , are missing from the shelves .
some 80 percent of the strip 's population of 1.5 million residents relies on food parcels handed out by un and international organizations containing basic items , including rice , flower and oil .
but those groups say they have had a hard time distributing their parcels amid the ongoing airstrikes and ground combat .
israel , for its part , says that while civilian populations are affected in times of combat , it is doing what it can to avoid a humanitarian crisis .
" currently there is no such -lrb- humanitarian -rrb- calamity , " the israeli foreign ministry insisted in a statement monday .
the ministry pointed out that , since the gaza offensive began , the kerem shalom border crossing with southern gaza has been open to daily humanitarian aid , allowing in more than 400 trucks with 10,000 tons of supplies in the first week .
some 2,000 units of blood donated by jordan and 10 ambulances donated by turkey and the palestinian red crescent in the west bank also passed through the crossing , while 20 palestinians were evacuated to hospitals in israel .
un urges israel to allow in more aid bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has thrown a ring of steel around gaza the united nations says it is not enough .
before hamas took control of the gaza strip in june , and under an eu-palestinian- israeli agreement from november 2005 , some 475 trucks entered gaza each day , noted the un 's office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs -lrb- ocha -rrb- .
philippe lazzarini , ocha 's head in the palestinian areas , urged israel to also open also its karni crossing for commercial goods and allow in more supplies , as kerem shalom can handle only up to 100 trucks a day .
he also urged israel to accept a humanitarian truce to allow gazans " a breathing space " and pick up their food aid without running risks to their personal safety .
" by any standard there is a humanitarian crisis in gaza , " he told the dpa news agency .
" it 's an unprecedented crisis for the people in gaza .
people are hungry , people are cold and people feel fear all the time . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

three german children looking to escape the winter weather set off on a trip to africa , but they only made it as far as their local train station , police said . the adventurous trio , fed up with the cold temperatures , planned to ring in the new year under the african sun .
and that 's not all - they also intended to celebrate a wedding , police spokesman holger jureczko said .
six-year-old mika and seven-year-old anna-lena , it turns out , " are very much in love and decided to get married in africa where it is warm , " he said .
they took anna-lena 's five-year-old sister along with them to act as a witness .
they got the idea from mika 's tales of his recent holiday in italy as their families celebrated together on new year 's eve .
he assured the two girls that africa would be even warmer , jureczko said .
the next morning , while their parents slept , the children set off from the suburbs of hanover , clutching cases packed with all the essentials needed for their trip : sunglasses , food , and swimsuits .
they boarded a tram to the central train station and were waiting for a train to take them to the airport when they were stopped by police .
two officers managed to convince the kids that it would be hard to get to africa with no money and no plane ticket .
instead , they got a decidedly less romantic tour of the police headquarters before being handed over to their parents . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 05.01.2009 the left party , taking east german politics west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the left party is new , but has a long history few other parties in germany are as divisive - and no other party has changed its name so often .
so what is the left party ?
where did it come from ?
and what are its policies ? december 1989 .
the border between east and west germany has been open for a month .
the berlin wall has fallen , taking down with it an entire political system .
the east german parliament has deleted from the gdr constitution the paragraph that gave the socialist unity party the leading role in deciding the country 's politics .
party members debate the party 's future at a special party conference . two options are presented : the dissolution of the party or a fundamental renewal from within .
in the end , the party is not dissolved .
instead it adopts a new program and a new name .
henceforth it will be known as the sed-pds : socialist unity party- party of democratic socialism .
of the party 's 4,000 full-time functionaries , just 200 remain . only a few predict a glorious future for the party . regional eastern german party ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sed is a thing of the past twenty years on , the party which now bears the name the left party - die linke - is the fourth party in national elections behind the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
in the eastern states the party is actually neck and neck with the cdu and , in some state parliaments , is ahead of the spd . not even the experts saw its success coming . " almost from nothing , from being given no chance as a parliamentary party , a party has been put together that is capable of attracting 10 percent of the vote at national elections , " said political scientist tim spier from goettingen university .
" that is remarkable . " at the time , many observers thought the party renamed the pds on feb .
4 , 1990 , would n't be around for very long .
the party did get a respectable 11.1 percent of the vote in the eastern states at the first general election after reunification .
but nationally , it only got 2.4 percent .
many commentators thought that this eastern german regional party 's significance would quickly dwindle as economic and social differences between the east and west disappeared . fast-forward development but the rise of the pds was uninterrupted and unstoppable .
in 1990 the party got just 9.7 percent of the vote in an election in the eastern state of thuringia .
four years later it rose to 16.6 percent .
in 1999 they got 21.3 percent of the vote and in 2006 a solid 26,2 percent . it is no longer possible to dismiss the party as a regional phenomenon or as a party that merely attracts a protest vote . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gregor gysi chaired the sed-pds until 1993 in 1994 , a social democrat-green coalition in saxony anhalt became the first to rely on the support of the pds .
the first state government with direct pds participation -lrb- in a coalition with the spd -rrb- came in 1998 in mecklenburg-west pomerania .
since 2001 the german capital has also been ruled by a spd-pds coalition .
for spier this is " fast-forward progress . " but participation in government in berlin is not just been a blessing for the party .
in the 2006 election , the party 's share of the vote in its eastern stronghold fell by up to 20 percent . commentators blamed this on the pds ' lack of political profile .
but just at this critical moment , the party for work and social justice -lrb- wasg -rrb- arrived on the scene .
the wasg - founded in 2005 as a protest against spd chancellor gerhard schroeder 's social and economic reforms - was an alliance of disaffected spd members and trade unionists . the wasg also saw itself as a democratic socialist party .
it was only natural then that the two parties should merge .
they became the left party : die linke . a small established party in bremen in may 2007 , the left party entered a state parliament in western germany for the first time .
now the party is also represented in the western states of lower saxony and hessen . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oskar lafontaine chairs the left party together with lothar bisky the party has managed to tap into a mood among the population according to spier 's analysis . the left party has been able to position itself as a party of social justice better than the traditional party of social welfare , the spd . " this will secure their place for the foreseeable future , " said spier . few other parties have the power to generate as much emotional and passionate argument as the left party .
the new-old party tends to provoke a knee-jerk anti-communist reflex in the established democratic parties .
but these parties are having to come to terms with the fact that the old four party political landscape has become a five party landscape and that this will remain the case for some time . but what does the left party want ?
it has yet to put forward a comprehensive program , and its message is often confusing .
the party is apparently in favor of a free market economy - but is often anti-capitalist .
whether it can steer a clear course remains to be seen . marcus boesch -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wombats and franz ferdinand are among the artists whose seven-inch vinyl records are being sleeved and boxed at the portalspace factory in hayes , on the edge of west london .
as it happens , they are the latest in a venerable tradition .

" have a feel of that , " says a passing engineer , handing over a white vinyl off-cut that has just been trimmed from the edge of a newly-manufactured disc .
it is warm to the touch - literally hot off the presses .
" that 'll warm you up on a cold day , " he says .
" and we can recycle that and use it again . "
hue and cry most people think of records as being made of black plastic , but it turns out that coloured vinyl is as old as the seven-inch single itself .
the first 45 rpm disc , texarkana baby by country-and-western singer eddy arnold , was issued by rca in the us on 31 march 1949 .
the first vinyl single , 60 years on enlarge image it was made of green vinyl , as part of an early attempt to colour-code singles according to the genre of music they featured .
others included red for classical music and yellow for children 's songs .
but such novelty features were left behind when the advent of rock and pop turned the 45 into the music industry 's most prized product .
seven-inch sales peaked in the uk in 1979 , when a staggering 89 million of them were sold , but once the cd hit the market , vinyl of all kinds went into sharp decline .
in 2001 , annual singles sales dipped below 180,000 .
the portalspace factory has experienced both the highs and the lows of the single 's history .
it used to be emi 's main manufacturing site , churning out million-sellers by the beatles and queen , among others .
at its zenith , it employed 14,000 people , but emi sold off the factory in 2000 when it decided to get out of the vinyl business .
now portalspace has just 30 employees on much smaller premises .
roy matthews , who used to run the factory for emi and is now portalspace 's general manager , says production of the seven-inch format dwindled to " almost nothing " at one point , but is now healthy again .
" although we almost pronounced its death eight or nine years ago , it 's now revived itself enormously , " he says .
that rebound is reflected in uk sales figures for seven-inch discs , which have now risen to more than one million a year , most of them pressed at portalspace .
innovations but who is actually buying all these singles ?
according to the british phonographic industry , which represents the british music business , a new generation of bands is attracting younger buyers .
vinyl singles are still being made in a variety of colours the bpi says the " popularity of bands such as oasis , white stripes -lsb- and -rsb- arctic monkeys " is reviving sales of the seven-inch , while record companies are also credited with using " innovative " strategies to highlight the format .
in 2007 , the white stripes and their label , xl recordings , gave away a red vinyl single mounted on the cover of the nme weekly music magazine .
it came in a gatefold sleeve with space to hold the band 's commercial release , icky thump - a promotion that resulted in the highest sales for a vinyl seven-inch in more than two decades .
another xl artist , 24-year-old singer-songwriter jack penate , is an especially keen fan of the 45 , despite the fact that he was n't even born when the format was in its heyday .
to launch his career , he released a limited-edition single that featured a unique polaroid photograph stuck to the front of every copy .
as well as making singles , he also collects them and even djs in clubs using just seven-inch records .
jack penate is particularly fond of the seven-inch single " what i love about seven-inch singles is the sound quality and the warmth , and also that they 're physical , and i will keep them forever and i cherish them .
they 're not throwaway , " he says .
" i always feel that if you download music , you rarely listen to it over and over again , whereas most of my singles have been played hundreds of times . "
independent sales the bpi admits that seven-inch singles may be even more popular than its figures suggest , since they are based on shops that report to the official uk charts company , which compiles the weekly top 40 .
as it acknowledges , many singles are sold through specialist retailers , which do not necessarily have their sales figures canvassed for the charts .
at one such retailer , rough trade east in london 's brick lane area , seven-inch singles are prominently displayed .
some independent retailers still give plenty of space to 45s the shop 's co-owner and manager , nigel house , says they are an important part of its stock .
" they get people into the shop , buying records , " he says .
" obviously , you make more money selling a cd , but there 's nothing like seven-inch singles , especially for the music aficionados .
" they 're tactile , they have fantastic sleeves , they sound great , they 're concise .
pure pop . "
but despite the healthy sales figures , today 's vinyl record buyers may be treating their purchases as cult objects , rather than actually playing them .
have your say i can still remember the excitement of buying a vinyl single on a saturday morning claire herbert send us your comments " a lot of the kids who buy these seven-inches probably do n't have record players , " says jack penate .
" i think it 's a lot more that they love looking at them .
" for them , it 's something from a lost era .
maybe it makes them feel more like a real fan .
they 've got something physical , instead of mp3s , which are completely ' non ' - there 's nothing to hold or see . "
singles barred that lost era took another step further into the past recently , with the demise of one of the most important stockists of old vinyl singles .
beanos of croydon , in south london , used to be the biggest second-hand record shop in europe , with its singles bar department boasting copies of virtually every seven-inch to make the charts since their inception in 1952 .
david lashmar has been a singles fan almost from the beginning but the shop has been struggling to survive for the past two years , and is set to close by march 2009 .
beanos has already disposed of its last remaining singles , with only cds and vinyl lps still in the racks .
owner david lashmar plans to open an indoor market in the same building , but he admits he will miss his 30 years as a dealer in seven-inch 45s .
" back in the late 1950s , buying a seven-inch single , having it at home , taking it down the youth club and impressing the birds with it was a really important thing to do , " he says .
" that was all i could afford .
a seven-inch single was pitched dead right .
it was an indulgence , but it would give you status . "
those heady days will never return .
but for many music lovers , the snap , crackle and pop of vinyl remains very much alive .

it came in a gatefold sleeve with space to hold the band 's commercial release , icky thump - a promotion that resulted in the highest sales for a vinyl seven-inch in more than two decades .
another xl artist , 24-year-old singer-songwriter jack penate , is an especially keen fan of the 45 , despite the fact that he was n't even born when the format was in its heyday .
to launch his career , he released a limited-edition single that featured a unique polaroid photograph stuck to the front of every copy .
as well as making singles , he also collects them and even djs in clubs using just seven-inch records .
jack penate is particularly fond of the seven-inch single " what i love about seven-inch singles is the sound quality and the warmth , and also that they 're physical , and i will keep them forever and i cherish them .
they 're not throwaway , " he says .
" i always feel that if you download music , you rarely listen to it over and over again , whereas most of my singles have been played hundreds of times . "
independent sales the bpi admits that seven-inch singles may be even more popular than its figures suggest , since they are based on shops that report to the official uk charts company , which compiles the weekly top 40 .
as it acknowledges , many singles are sold through specialist retailers , which do not necessarily have their sales figures canvassed for the charts .
at one such retailer , rough trade east in london 's brick lane area , seven-inch singles are prominently displayed .
some independent retailers still give plenty of space to 45s the shop 's co-owner and manager , nigel house , says they are an important part of its stock .
" they get people into the shop , buying records , " he says .
" obviously , you make more money selling a cd , but there 's nothing like seven-inch singles , especially for the music aficionados .
" they 're tactile , they have fantastic sleeves , they sound great , they 're concise .
pure pop . "
but despite the healthy sales figures , today 's vinyl record buyers may be treating their purchases as cult objects , rather than actually playing them .
have your say i can still remember the excitement of buying a vinyl single on a saturday morning claire herbert send us your comments " a lot of the kids who buy these seven-inches probably do n't have record players , " says jack penate .
" i think it 's a lot more that they love looking at them .
" for them , it 's something from a lost era .
maybe it makes them feel more like a real fan .
they 've got something physical , instead of mp3s , which are completely ' non ' - there 's nothing to hold or see . "
singles barred that lost era took another step further into the past recently , with the demise of one of the most important stockists of old vinyl singles .
beanos of croydon , in south london , used to be the biggest second-hand record shop in europe , with its singles bar department boasting copies of virtually every seven-inch to make the charts since their inception in 1952 .
david lashmar has been a singles fan almost from the beginning but the shop has been struggling to survive for the past two years , and is set to close by march 2009 .
beanos has already disposed of its last remaining singles , with only cds and vinyl lps still in the racks .
owner david lashmar plans to open an indoor market in the same building , but he admits he will miss his 30 years as a dealer in seven-inch 45s .
" back in the late 1950s , buying a seven-inch single , having it at home , taking it down the youth club and impressing the birds with it was a really important thing to do , " he says .
" that was all i could afford .
a seven-inch single was pitched dead right .
it was an indulgence , but it would give you status . "
those heady days will never return .
but for many music lovers , the snap , crackle and pop of vinyl remains very much alive .

according to the british phonographic industry , which represents the british music business , a new generation of bands is attracting younger buyers .
vinyl singles are still being made in a variety of colours the bpi says the " popularity of bands such as oasis , white stripes -lsb- and -rsb- arctic monkeys " is reviving sales of the seven-inch , while record companies are also credited with using " innovative " strategies to highlight the format .
in 2007 , the white stripes and their label , xl recordings , gave away a red vinyl single mounted on the cover of the nme weekly music magazine .
it came in a gatefold sleeve with space to hold the band 's commercial release , icky thump - a promotion that resulted in the highest sales for a vinyl seven-inch in more than two decades .
another xl artist , 24-year-old singer-songwriter jack penate , is an especially keen fan of the 45 , despite the fact that he was n't even born when the format was in its heyday .
to launch his career , he released a limited-edition single that featured a unique polaroid photograph stuck to the front of every copy .
as well as making singles , he also collects them and even djs in clubs using just seven-inch records .
jack penate is particularly fond of the seven-inch single " what i love about seven-inch singles is the sound quality and the warmth , and also that they 're physical , and i will keep them forever and i cherish them .
they 're not throwaway , " he says .
" i always feel that if you download music , you rarely listen to it over and over again , whereas most of my singles have been played hundreds of times . "
independent sales the bpi admits that seven-inch singles may be even more popular than its figures suggest , since they are based on shops that report to the official uk charts company , which compiles the weekly top 40 .
as it acknowledges , many singles are sold through specialist retailers , which do not necessarily have their sales figures canvassed for the charts .
at one such retailer , rough trade east in london 's brick lane area , seven-inch singles are prominently displayed .
some independent retailers still give plenty of space to 45s the shop 's co-owner and manager , nigel house , says they are an important part of its stock .
" they get people into the shop , buying records , " he says .
" obviously , you make more money selling a cd , but there 's nothing like seven-inch singles , especially for the music aficionados .
" they 're tactile , they have fantastic sleeves , they sound great , they 're concise .
pure pop . "
but despite the healthy sales figures , today 's vinyl record buyers may be treating their purchases as cult objects , rather than actually playing them .
have your say i can still remember the excitement of buying a vinyl single on a saturday morning claire herbert send us your comments " a lot of the kids who buy these seven-inches probably do n't have record players , " says jack penate .
" i think it 's a lot more that they love looking at them .
" for them , it 's something from a lost era .
maybe it makes them feel more like a real fan .
they 've got something physical , instead of mp3s , which are completely ' non ' - there 's nothing to hold or see . "
singles barred that lost era took another step further into the past recently , with the demise of one of the most important stockists of old vinyl singles .
beanos of croydon , in south london , used to be the biggest second-hand record shop in europe , with its singles bar department boasting copies of virtually every seven-inch to make the charts since their inception in 1952 .
david lashmar has been a singles fan almost from the beginning but the shop has been struggling to survive for the past two years , and is set to close by march 2009 .
beanos has already disposed of its last remaining singles , with only cds and vinyl lps still in the racks .
owner david lashmar plans to open an indoor market in the same building , but he admits he will miss his 30 years as a dealer in seven-inch 45s .
" back in the late 1950s , buying a seven-inch single , having it at home , taking it down the youth club and impressing the birds with it was a really important thing to do , " he says .
" that was all i could afford .
a seven-inch single was pitched dead right .
it was an indulgence , but it would give you status . "
those heady days will never return .
but for many music lovers , the snap , crackle and pop of vinyl remains very much alive .

downloads and ipods are all very well , but for many musicians , your latest song just has n't been released until it 's been forced on to a small , grooved plastic disc at a pressure of more than 2,000 lb per square inch .
the wombats and franz ferdinand are among the artists whose seven-inch vinyl records are being sleeved and boxed at the portalspace factory in hayes , on the edge of west london .
as it happens , they are the latest in a venerable tradition .
the 45 rpm single is about to reach its 60th anniversary and despite repeated predictions of its demise , sales are rising once again .
" have a feel of that , " says a passing engineer , handing over a white vinyl off-cut that has just been trimmed from the edge of a newly-manufactured disc .
it is warm to the touch - literally hot off the presses .
" that 'll warm you up on a cold day , " he says .
" and we can recycle that and use it again . "
hue and cry most people think of records as being made of black plastic , but it turns out that coloured vinyl is as old as the seven-inch single itself .
the first 45 rpm disc , texarkana baby by country-and-western singer eddy arnold , was issued by rca in the us on 31 march 1949 .
it was made of green vinyl , as part of an early attempt to colour-code singles according to the genre of music they featured .
others included red for classical music and yellow for children 's songs .
but such novelty features were left behind when the advent of rock and pop turned the 45 into the music industry 's most prized product .
seven-inch sales peaked in the uk in 1979 , when a staggering 89 million of them were sold , but once the cd hit the market , vinyl of all kinds went into sharp decline .
in 2001 , annual singles sales dipped below 180,000 .
the portalspace factory has experienced both the highs and the lows of the single 's history .
it used to be emi 's main manufacturing site , churning out million-sellers by the beatles and queen , among others .
at its zenith , it employed 14,000 people , but emi sold off the factory in 2000 when it decided to get out of the vinyl business .
now portalspace has just 30 employees on much smaller premises .
roy matthews , who used to run the factory for emi and is now portalspace 's general manager , says production of the seven-inch format dwindled to " almost nothing " at one point , but is now healthy again .
" although we almost pronounced its death eight or nine years ago , it 's now revived itself enormously , " he says .
that rebound is reflected in uk sales figures for seven-inch discs , which have now risen to more than one million a year , most of them pressed at portalspace .
innovations but who is actually buying all these singles ?

ysgol y graig at llangefni boasts sustainable timber , a wind turbine and a plant and insect-friendly roof .
the £ 3.7m primary school has been designed to generate up to 50 % of its own electricity .
headteacher glyn roberts described the the new campus at lôn talwrn as " very impressive with facilities which are second to none . "
the school 's innovative design , including a host of energy saving features , has been undertaken by anglesey council 's architectural services team .
all internal lighting has been fitted with energy-efficient lamps , helping the school generate half of its own electricity through its solar roof tiles and wind turbine , with surplus electricity sold back to the national grid .
the ' green roof ' has been designed to provide a natural habitat for plants and wildlife . "
we live in an age where climate change is high on the agenda " anglesey council leader phil fowlie contractors wynne construction have built the new ysgol y graig which was originally located on a busy industrial estate near the town centre .
anglesey council said the relocation would greatly reduce the number of cars delivering and collecting the children , improving road safety and leading to a significant drop in co ² exhaust emissions .
the campus also includes a new footpath link from the nearby housing estate , providing the children with a safe walking or cycling route to school .
council leader , cllr phil fowlie , commented : " this is a real landmark project for the isle of anglesey county council and the first new school to be built on the island since 2002 .
" we live in an age where climate change is high on the agenda , and this new school will be state of the art in terms of sustainability and environmental design . "
' science project ' headmaster glyn roberts said pupils had already had a sneak preview of their new school before the christmas holidays .
he added : " today is a very special day for them , one they have eagerly been looking forward to for many months .
" the new ysgol y graig has so much to offer the pupils , in fact i 'm certain that the building in itself will provide the children with a very interesting science project as well as a great new school . "
anglesey 's education spokesman cllr eurfryn davies said the project demonstrated the council 's strong commitment to education provision .
" i 'm sure that the pupils and staff will enjoy settling into their new school and i wish them well for the future , " he said .

advertisement watch clips of la roux 's music video as singer elly jackson explains why she wants to bring back the 1980s .
by ian youngs music reporter , bbc news the bbc 's sound of 2009 list has gathered some of the best new music by asking critics and broadcasters to name their favourite up-and-coming artists .
colourful london synth duo la roux kick off the coverage at number five on the list .
one act from the top five will be revealed every day until friday , when the winner will be announced .
" we do n't listen to anything apart from ' 80s music , " explains elly jackson , the synth-loving , crazy-haired , pop-obsessed rising star who is determined to take us back to the future .
i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair - what happened to all the crazy hair ?
elly jackson sound of 2009 : full coverage she is the face and voice of la roux , whose manifesto involves ridding the charts of boring indie bands , contrived girl groups and too-cool dance acts .
at 20 , jackson was not even born until the end of the 1980s .
but the massive melodies , outlandish outfits , strong personalities and technicolor creativity have convinced her that current pop music has lost its way and it is time to turn back the clock .
" we 're trying to make pop music like it used to be in the ' 80s , " says jackson , who was born and bred in brixton .
" it was so epic in the ' 80s and no-one makes epic otherworldly pop music any more .
" there 's an endless amount of stuff to find in the ' 80s .
i ca n't seem to move on to modern music because there 's so much stuff from the ' 80s that i 'm still discovering . "
jackson and production partner ben langmaid have been meticulously been working their way through the back catalogues of acts like the eurythmics , depeche mode , gary numan , heaven 17 , prince and blancmange .
" music does n't feel honest any more , " she continues .
" that music feels really free .
really experimental and free and it 's so contrived now . "
her love of the decade 's decadence crosses over into image and style , and elly wants to stand out like a true ' 80s star , borrowing bits from the dressing up boxes of bananarama , annie lennox and boy george .
' big and epic ' in the video for their debut single quicksand , she perches on the rim of a giant margarita cocktail as her wedge of red hair blows in the breeze on a pastel martian beach .
" there 's a lot of people who look like they could be anyone in pop , " she says .
" i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair .
there 's no-one with crazy hair any more !
what happened to all the crazy hair ?

media requires javascript to play .
watch the full video for la roux 's debut single quicksand " everyone just looks like the girl next door now in pop music , which i do n't think is right .
surely it should all be about entertainment and being theatrical and big and epic . "
jackson began moulding her grand ambition after being put in touch with langmaid , a veteran of the british music scene , by a mutual acquaintance .
langmaid 's best friend at school was faithless mastermind and dido 's brother rollo armstrong , and in the mid-1990s they grazed the top 40 as house duo huff & puff .
langmaid introduced armstrong to his future faithless bandmates , was signed to armstrong 's label under the alias atomic , and was part of another dance huff & herb .
he then started writing songs for middle-of-the-road rockers kubb , who were on the bbc 's sound of 2006 list .
as it turned out , they were n't the sound of 2006 .
so he turned his attention to working with jackson , first under the name automan , then becoming la roux , which means " red-haired one " in french .
' ridiculously emotional ' " it was musically love at first sight , " says jackson .
" we 're very similar people .
we just want to make massive pop tunes . "
jackson and langmaid are both " ridiculously emotional people " who can regularly be found on the floor in floods of tears , the singer says .
i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway ...
i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action elly jackson " then we channel our most depressing moments into what should be big happy moments in music .
without the therapeutic process of putting those hard times into music , we 'd both be dead .
literally . "
so what do they get emotional about ?
" it 's always about love is n't it ?
come on , " jackson retorts .
" my vulnerable emotions are all to do with love .
" i 'm a really vulnerable person actually , but what i like about the music is that it all sounds quite defiant .
it sounds kinda powerful , and that 's what gets me out of situations .
" you imagine singing it on stage to that one person that it 's about , and saying really , really honest things .
i get an adrenalin rush from being really honest and saying things you should n't quite say . "
jackson and langmaid have been working together for three years , starting out as an acoustic guitar-based outfit before deciding they were bored of that sound , scrapping their work and reinventing themselves as retro revivalists .
" i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway , unless it gets reinvented in some way , " says jackson .
" i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action . "
more than 130 leading uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in sound of 2009 .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile the list .

advertisement watch clips of la roux 's music video as singer elly jackson explains why she wants to bring back the 1980s .
by ian youngs music reporter , bbc news the bbc 's sound of 2009 list has gathered some of the best new music by asking critics and broadcasters to name their favourite up-and-coming artists .
colourful london synth duo la roux kick off the coverage at number five on the list .
one act from the top five will be revealed every day until friday , when the winner will be announced .
" we do n't listen to anything apart from ' 80s music , " explains elly jackson , the synth-loving , crazy-haired , pop-obsessed rising star who is determined to take us back to the future .
i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair - what happened to all the crazy hair ?
elly jackson sound of 2009 : full coverage she is the face and voice of la roux , whose manifesto involves ridding the charts of boring indie bands , contrived girl groups and too-cool dance acts .
at 20 , jackson was not even born until the end of the 1980s .
but the massive melodies , outlandish outfits , strong personalities and technicolor creativity have convinced her that current pop music has lost its way and it is time to turn back the clock .
" we 're trying to make pop music like it used to be in the ' 80s , " says jackson , who was born and bred in brixton .
" it was so epic in the ' 80s and no-one makes epic otherworldly pop music any more .
" there 's an endless amount of stuff to find in the ' 80s .
i ca n't seem to move on to modern music because there 's so much stuff from the ' 80s that i 'm still discovering . "
jackson and production partner ben langmaid have been meticulously been working their way through the back catalogues of acts like the eurythmics , depeche mode , gary numan , heaven 17 , prince and blancmange .
" music does n't feel honest any more , " she continues .
" that music feels really free .
really experimental and free and it 's so contrived now . "
her love of the decade 's decadence crosses over into image and style , and elly wants to stand out like a true ' 80s star , borrowing bits from the dressing up boxes of bananarama , annie lennox and boy george .
' big and epic ' in the video for their debut single quicksand , she perches on the rim of a giant margarita cocktail as her wedge of red hair blows in the breeze on a pastel martian beach .
" there 's a lot of people who look like they could be anyone in pop , " she says .
" i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair .
there 's no-one with crazy hair any more !
what happened to all the crazy hair ?

watch the full video for la roux 's debut single quicksand " everyone just looks like the girl next door now in pop music , which i do n't think is right .
surely it should all be about entertainment and being theatrical and big and epic . "
jackson began moulding her grand ambition after being put in touch with langmaid , a veteran of the british music scene , by a mutual acquaintance .
langmaid 's best friend at school was faithless mastermind and dido 's brother rollo armstrong , and in the mid-1990s they grazed the top 40 as house duo huff & puff .
langmaid introduced armstrong to his future faithless bandmates , was signed to armstrong 's label under the alias atomic , and was part of another dance huff & herb .
he then started writing songs for middle-of-the-road rockers kubb , who were on the bbc 's sound of 2006 list .
as it turned out , they were n't the sound of 2006 .
so he turned his attention to working with jackson , first under the name automan , then becoming la roux , which means " red-haired one " in french .
' ridiculously emotional ' " it was musically love at first sight , " says jackson .
" we 're very similar people .
we just want to make massive pop tunes . "
jackson and langmaid are both " ridiculously emotional people " who can regularly be found on the floor in floods of tears , the singer says .
i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway ...
i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action elly jackson " then we channel our most depressing moments into what should be big happy moments in music .
without the therapeutic process of putting those hard times into music , we 'd both be dead .
literally . "
so what do they get emotional about ?
" it 's always about love is n't it ?
come on , " jackson retorts .
" my vulnerable emotions are all to do with love .
" i 'm a really vulnerable person actually , but what i like about the music is that it all sounds quite defiant .
it sounds kinda powerful , and that 's what gets me out of situations .
" you imagine singing it on stage to that one person that it 's about , and saying really , really honest things .
i get an adrenalin rush from being really honest and saying things you should n't quite say . "
jackson and langmaid have been working together for three years , starting out as an acoustic guitar-based outfit before deciding they were bored of that sound , scrapping their work and reinventing themselves as retro revivalists .
" i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway , unless it gets reinvented in some way , " says jackson .
" i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action . "
more than 130 leading uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in sound of 2009 .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile the list .

i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair - what happened to all the crazy hair ? "
elly jackson sound of 2009 : full coverage she is the face and voice of la roux , whose manifesto involves ridding the charts of boring indie bands , contrived girl groups and too-cool dance acts .
at 20 , jackson was not even born until the end of the 1980s .
but the massive melodies , outlandish outfits , strong personalities and technicolor creativity have convinced her that current pop music has lost its way and it is time to turn back the clock .
" we 're trying to make pop music like it used to be in the ' 80s , " says jackson , who was born and bred in brixton .
" it was so epic in the ' 80s and no-one makes epic otherworldly pop music any more .
" there 's an endless amount of stuff to find in the ' 80s .
i ca n't seem to move on to modern music because there 's so much stuff from the ' 80s that i 'm still discovering . "
jackson and production partner ben langmaid have been meticulously been working their way through the back catalogues of acts like the eurythmics , depeche mode , gary numan , heaven 17 , prince and blancmange .
" music does n't feel honest any more , " she continues .
" that music feels really free .
really experimental and free and it 's so contrived now . "
her love of the decade 's decadence crosses over into image and style , and elly wants to stand out like a true ' 80s star , borrowing bits from the dressing up boxes of bananarama , annie lennox and boy george .
' big and epic ' in the video for their debut single quicksand , she perches on the rim of a giant margarita cocktail as her wedge of red hair blows in the breeze on a pastel martian beach .
" there 's a lot of people who look like they could be anyone in pop , " she says .
" i want to see people who are n't afraid to look a bit mad and have crazy hair .
there 's no-one with crazy hair any more !
what happened to all the crazy hair ?
" everyone just looks like the girl next door now in pop music , which i do n't think is right .
surely it should all be about entertainment and being theatrical and big and epic . "
jackson began moulding her grand ambition after being put in touch with langmaid , a veteran of the british music scene , by a mutual acquaintance .
langmaid 's best friend at school was faithless mastermind and dido 's brother rollo armstrong , and in the mid-1990s they grazed the top 40 as house duo huff & puff .
langmaid introduced armstrong to his future faithless bandmates , was signed to armstrong 's label under the alias atomic , and was part of another dance huff & herb .
he then started writing songs for middle-of-the-road rockers kubb , who were on the bbc 's sound of 2006 list .
as it turned out , they were n't the sound of 2006 .
so he turned his attention to working with jackson , first under the name automan , then becoming la roux , which means " red-haired one " in french .
' ridiculously emotional ' " it was musically love at first sight , " says jackson .
" we 're very similar people .
we just want to make massive pop tunes . "
jackson and langmaid are both " ridiculously emotional people " who can regularly be found on the floor in floods of tears , the singer says . "
i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway ...
i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action " elly jackson " then we channel our most depressing moments into what should be big happy moments in music .
without the therapeutic process of putting those hard times into music , we 'd both be dead .
literally . "
so what do they get emotional about ?
" it 's always about love is n't it ?
come on , " jackson retorts .
" my vulnerable emotions are all to do with love .
" i 'm a really vulnerable person actually , but what i like about the music is that it all sounds quite defiant .
it sounds kinda powerful , and that 's what gets me out of situations .
" you imagine singing it on stage to that one person that it 's about , and saying really , really honest things .
i get an adrenalin rush from being really honest and saying things you should n't quite say . "
jackson and langmaid have been working together for three years , starting out as an acoustic guitar-based outfit before deciding they were bored of that sound , scrapping their work and reinventing themselves as retro revivalists .
" i think guitar music has had its day , for now anyway , unless it gets reinvented in some way , " says jackson .
" i think it 's definitely time for some serious synth action . "
more than 130 leading uk-based music writers , editors and broadcasters took part in sound of 2009 .
they named their three favourite new acts and their responses were used to compile the list .
