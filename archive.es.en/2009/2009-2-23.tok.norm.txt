program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 23.02.2009 european press review : time for a regulation clampdown großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : are gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel fraying ?
after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the ' eastern partnership ' is a very timely initiative that needs to be implemented , " ferrero-waldner said , adding that problems in eastern europe " affect us directly .

it includes free trade agreements , visa waivers , financial aid and economic integration with the eu . in return , the eastern neighbors are expected to step up progress toward economic modernization , democracy , the rule of law and human rights . the " eastern partnership " scheme is to be approved at an eu summit next month and launched in may . but some eu member states have expressed reservations about the proposal . france , which pushed the eu 's mediterranean union project last year , is reported to fear that increasing funding to the bloc 's eastern neighbors would shift the eu 's strategic focus away from north africa and the middle east . author : sonia phalnikar -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

some 61,000 vw workers in five different plants have been given an enforced five-day break in response to poor sales forecasts . the step comes as the global financial crisis continues to hit the entire car sector hard .
with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .
23 .
the vw works council agreed to the step .
" it is necessary to react to the different market circumstances , " it said in a statement .
volkswagen joins other german carmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has also had things better the vw subsidiary audi also introduced short-time work at its györ factory in hungary on monday .
production had already been halted at the site between mid december and mid january .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .

coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

british director danny boyle 's latest movie capped its rags-to- riches story on sunday , feb .
22 , when it earned eight of the coveted statuettes .
director danny boyle 's tale about the rise of an impoverished orphan to the final of india 's most popular quiz show earned the top gong for best picture , best director , best adapted screenplay , cinematography , original score , sound mixing , film editing and original song .
sean penn won the best actor oscar for his portrayal of a the first openly gay politician in the us in the movie " milk , " while kate winslet won the oscar for best actress .
a sensitive subject bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it remains to be seen what germany makes of " the reader " it was a first win for the british actress , after five unsuccessful nominations .
winslet won for her portrayal of an illiterate former nazi prison guard in the movie " the reader , " based on the bestselling 1995 novel by german writer bernhard schlink .
the film is set for general release in germany later this week but has already divided opinion among critics in britain , where it opened last month .
" everyone involved in this film is of the highest possible caliber , but their combined and formidable talents could not annul my queasiness that the question of nazi war guilt and the death camps had been reimagined in terms of a middlebrow sentimental-erotic fantasy , " wrote the guardian 's film critic peter bradshaw in january .
other winners australian actor heath ledger , meanwhile , won the oscar for best-supporting actor , more than a year after he died from an accidental drug overdose at the age of 28 .
ledger was honored for his portrayal of the manic criminal the joker in the batman movie " the dark knight . "
his award was accepted by his family , who received a standing ovation as they made their way to the stage .
the first prize of the evening went to penelope cruz for best-supporting actress in woody allen 's movie vicky christina barcelona .
german hopes dashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichinger 's movie failed to resonate with the academy judges germany went home empty-handed in the full-length film categories , losing out on the best foreign language film oscar to japan 's " departures , " a film about a classical musician who prepares bodies for burial .
its win was one of the evening 's surprises , beating the favored israeli entry " waltz with bashir , " one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year .
german entry " the baader meinhof complex , " about far-left radicals the red army faction - which carried out a 30-year campaign of bombings , killings , and kidnappings in germany - was represented by producer bernd eichinger , director uli ede and actors johanna wokalek , moritz bleibtreu and martina gedeck . it was eichinger 's second nomination and second disappointment .
four years ago , his movie " downfall " about hitler 's last days also failed to snag a best foreign film trophy .
however , jochen alexander freydank 's " spielzeugland " -lrb- toyland -rrb- went home with the oscar for the best short film -lrb- live action -rrb- .
the story of a young german boy who believes his jewish neighbors are going to toyland was the first academy award nomination for freydank .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

" the ' eastern partnership ' is a very timely initiative that needs to be implemented , " ferrero-waldner said , adding that problems in eastern europe " affect us directly . " eastern europe has been hard hit by the global slowdown with many countries facing rising popular anger as cash-strapped governments cut spending . ukraine , which received billions in aid from the international monetary fund last year , has seen widespread demonstrations as its economy crumbles and savers rush to pull out money from banks . democratic progress the plan aims to promote economic and political stability in the countries and reduce russia 's influence in the region .
it includes free trade agreements , visa waivers , financial aid and economic integration with the eu . in return , the eastern neighbors are expected to step up progress toward economic modernization , democracy , the rule of law and human rights . the " eastern partnership " scheme is to be approved at an eu summit next month and launched in may . but some eu member states have expressed reservations about the proposal . france , which pushed the eu 's mediterranean union project last year , is reported to fear that increasing funding to the bloc 's eastern neighbors would shift the eu 's strategic focus away from north africa and the middle east . author : sonia phalnikar -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

23 , that the european union has a " crucial strategic interest " in armenia , azerbaijan , georgia , moldova and ukraine . unveiled by the european commission last december , the " eastern partnership " foresees granting some 350 million euros -lrb- $ 448 million -rrb- in extra help between now and 2013 to the eu 's ex-soviet neighbors . speaking on the sidelines of a meeting of eu foreign ministers in brussels on monday , ferrero-waldner said the bloc 's so-called " eastern partnership " had gained urgency in the wake of the august conflict between georgia and russia and january 's gas standoff between russia and ukraine . " the ' eastern partnership ' is a very timely initiative that needs to be implemented , " ferrero-waldner said , adding that problems in eastern europe " affect us directly . " eastern europe has been hard hit by the global slowdown with many countries facing rising popular anger as cash-strapped governments cut spending . ukraine , which received billions in aid from the international monetary fund last year , has seen widespread demonstrations as its economy crumbles and savers rush to pull out money from banks . democratic progress the plan aims to promote economic and political stability in the countries and reduce russia 's influence in the region .
it includes free trade agreements , visa waivers , financial aid and economic integration with the eu . in return , the eastern neighbors are expected to step up progress toward economic modernization , democracy , the rule of law and human rights . the " eastern partnership " scheme is to be approved at an eu summit next month and launched in may . but some eu member states have expressed reservations about the proposal . france , which pushed the eu 's mediterranean union project last year , is reported to fear that increasing funding to the bloc 's eastern neighbors would shift the eu 's strategic focus away from north africa and the middle east . author : sonia phalnikar -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .

the vw works council agreed to the step .

an opel spokesman said in german radio on sunday that the company would present a plan in the next few days intended to overhaul the business and stave off imminent collapse .
chancellor angela merkel and the country 's new economics minister karl-theoder zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- have said the carmaker , a subsidiary of the ailing us firm general motors , would only receive state assistance if it put forward a feasible restructuring plan .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.02.2009 expert : german economy could shrink by over five percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen became the latest company to say it 's reducing working hours germany 's deutsche bank warned on monday the country 's economy could contract by more than five percent this year as europe 's largest economy sinks into its worst recession in decades . in an interview with the bild newspaper on monday , feb .
23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .
volkswagen became the latest carmaker to announce that around two-thirds of its 92,000 employees will have their working hours reduced this week as new car production continues to slide .

" the ' eastern partnership ' is a very timely initiative that needs to be implemented , " ferrero-waldner said , adding that problems in eastern europe " affect us directly . " eastern europe has been hard hit by the global slowdown with many countries facing rising popular anger as cash-strapped governments cut spending . ukraine , which received billions in aid from the international monetary fund last year , has seen widespread demonstrations as its economy crumbles and savers rush to pull out money from banks . democratic progress the plan aims to promote economic and political stability in the countries and reduce russia 's influence in the region .
it includes free trade agreements , visa waivers , financial aid and economic integration with the eu . in return , the eastern neighbors are expected to step up progress toward economic modernization , democracy , the rule of law and human rights . the " eastern partnership " scheme is to be approved at an eu summit next month and launched in may . but some eu member states have expressed reservations about the proposal . france , which pushed the eu 's mediterranean union project last year , is reported to fear that increasing funding to the bloc 's eastern neighbors would shift the eu 's strategic focus away from north africa and the middle east . author : sonia phalnikar -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

some 61,000 vw workers in five different plants have been given an enforced five-day break in response to poor sales forecasts . the step comes as the global financial crisis continues to hit the entire car sector hard .
with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .

the vw works council agreed to the step .
" it is necessary to react to the different market circumstances , " it said in a statement .

production had already been halted at the site between mid december and mid january .
other german car manufacturers , such as bmw and daimler , have already brought in short-time work . meanwhile , the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain .
an opel spokesman said in german radio on sunday that the company would present a plan in the next few days intended to overhaul the business and stave off imminent collapse .
chancellor angela merkel and the country 's new economics minister karl-theoder zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- have said the carmaker , a subsidiary of the ailing us firm general motors , would only receive state assistance if it put forward a feasible restructuring plan .
european solution for opel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation at opel remains bleak but foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- also stressed on sunday that germany should avoid going it alone in its support for the rüsselheim-based company .
he is in favor of a european solution for opel .
this sentiment was echoed by the opel works council klaus franz in german radio deutschlandfunk on monday . the german federation of family owned businesses , asu , spoke out against state assistance for opel on monday .
albrecht von hagen , the managing director of the lobby organization for small to medium sized enterprises , warned that it would distort the market .
" if the state helps opel out , what is going to happen in other businesses , let 's say ford or volkswagen ?
would n't that put them in a very trying situation , " von hagen told the public broadcaster zdf .
he said that it would be difficult to explain to vw workers that they were less well-off because opel was selling more cars as a result of state aid . author : julie gregson -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .

coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

some 61,000 vw workers in five different plants have been given an enforced five-day break in response to poor sales forecasts . the step comes as the global financial crisis continues to hit the entire car sector hard .
with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .
23 .
the vw works council agreed to the step .
" it is necessary to react to the different market circumstances , " it said in a statement .
volkswagen joins other german carmakers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has also had things better the vw subsidiary audi also introduced short-time work at its györ factory in hungary on monday .
production had already been halted at the site between mid december and mid january .
other german car manufacturers , such as bmw and daimler , have already brought in short-time work . meanwhile , the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain .
an opel spokesman said in german radio on sunday that the company would present a plan in the next few days intended to overhaul the business and stave off imminent collapse .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

the film is set for general release in germany later this week but has already divided opinion among critics in britain , where it opened last month .
" everyone involved in this film is of the highest possible caliber , but their combined and formidable talents could not annul my queasiness that the question of nazi war guilt and the death camps had been reimagined in terms of a middlebrow sentimental-erotic fantasy , " wrote the guardian 's film critic peter bradshaw in january .
other winners australian actor heath ledger , meanwhile , won the oscar for best-supporting actor , more than a year after he died from an accidental drug overdose at the age of 28 .
ledger was honored for his portrayal of the manic criminal the joker in the batman movie " the dark knight . "
his award was accepted by his family , who received a standing ovation as they made their way to the stage .
the first prize of the evening went to penelope cruz for best-supporting actress in woody allen 's movie vicky christina barcelona .
german hopes dashed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichinger 's movie failed to resonate with the academy judges germany went home empty-handed in the full-length film categories , losing out on the best foreign language film oscar to japan 's " departures , " a film about a classical musician who prepares bodies for burial .
its win was one of the evening 's surprises , beating the favored israeli entry " waltz with bashir , " one of the most critically acclaimed films of the year .
german entry " the baader meinhof complex , " about far-left radicals the red army faction - which carried out a 30-year campaign of bombings , killings , and kidnappings in germany - was represented by producer bernd eichinger , director uli ede and actors johanna wokalek , moritz bleibtreu and martina gedeck . it was eichinger 's second nomination and second disappointment .
four years ago , his movie " downfall " about hitler 's last days also failed to snag a best foreign film trophy .
however , jochen alexander freydank 's " spielzeugland " -lrb- toyland -rrb- went home with the oscar for the best short film -lrb- live action -rrb- .
the story of a young german boy who believes his jewish neighbors are going to toyland was the first academy award nomination for freydank .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

some 61,000 vw workers in five different plants have been given an enforced five-day break in response to poor sales forecasts . the step comes as the global financial crisis continues to hit the entire car sector hard .
with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .

the vw works council agreed to the step .
" it is necessary to react to the different market circumstances , " it said in a statement .

other german car manufacturers , such as bmw and daimler , have already brought in short-time work . meanwhile , the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain .
an opel spokesman said in german radio on sunday that the company would present a plan in the next few days intended to overhaul the business and stave off imminent collapse .
chancellor angela merkel and the country 's new economics minister karl-theoder zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- have said the carmaker , a subsidiary of the ailing us firm general motors , would only receive state assistance if it put forward a feasible restructuring plan .
european solution for opel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation at opel remains bleak but foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- also stressed on sunday that germany should avoid going it alone in its support for the rüsselheim-based company .
he is in favor of a european solution for opel .
this sentiment was echoed by the opel works council klaus franz in german radio deutschlandfunk on monday . the german federation of family owned businesses , asu , spoke out against state assistance for opel on monday .
albrecht von hagen , the managing director of the lobby organization for small to medium sized enterprises , warned that it would distort the market .
" if the state helps opel out , what is going to happen in other businesses , let 's say ford or volkswagen ?
would n't that put them in a very trying situation , " von hagen told the public broadcaster zdf .
he said that it would be difficult to explain to vw workers that they were less well-off because opel was selling more cars as a result of state aid . author : julie gregson -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .

coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.02.2009 expert : german economy could shrink by over five percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen became the latest company to say it 's reducing working hours germany 's deutsche bank warned on monday the country 's economy could contract by more than five percent this year as europe 's largest economy sinks into its worst recession in decades . in an interview with the bild newspaper on monday , feb .
23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

czechs are still believed to be nursing the number one spot . austrians may often feel overshadowed by germany , but when it comes to beer-drinking they 've now overtaken their bigger neighbors . the austrian brewery association has revealed that its countrymen and women downed an impressive 8.6 million hectoliters of beer in 2008 , or 109.3 liters per person . that 's second only now to the czech republic - the birthplace of pilsner - in the world rankings . beer drinking may be regarded by many as a german national sport , but consumption per head of the amber nectar actually dropped slightly to 108 lites last year . czechs expected to be out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the introduction of new flavors , german beer sales dropped no 2008 figures are available yet for the czech republic , but the czechs are expected to have comfortably defended their position as the world 's top quaffers .
in 2007 , per capita consumption stood at 159 liters of beer . while two percent more of the beverage flowed from austrian taps in 2008 , beer consumption dropped among britons , still regarded as some of the world 's most avid alcohol drinkers .
sales figures in belgium and the netherlands also fell , the brewery association said on monday . despite the good news for austrian beer sellers , there are also fears that the country 's thirst for suds may be quenched somewhat by the global financial crisis .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czechs are still believed to be nursing the number one spot . austrians may often feel overshadowed by germany , but when it comes to beer-drinking they 've now overtaken their bigger neighbors . the austrian brewery association has revealed that its countrymen and women downed an impressive 8.6 million hectoliters of beer in 2008 , or 109.3 liters per person . that 's second only now to the czech republic - the birthplace of pilsner - in the world rankings . beer drinking may be regarded by many as a german national sport , but consumption per head of the amber nectar actually dropped slightly to 108 lites last year . czechs expected to be out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the introduction of new flavors , german beer sales dropped no 2008 figures are available yet for the czech republic , but the czechs are expected to have comfortably defended their position as the world 's top quaffers .

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

czechs are still believed to be nursing the number one spot . austrians may often feel overshadowed by germany , but when it comes to beer-drinking they 've now overtaken their bigger neighbors . the austrian brewery association has revealed that its countrymen and women downed an impressive 8.6 million hectoliters of beer in 2008 , or 109.3 liters per person . that 's second only now to the czech republic - the birthplace of pilsner - in the world rankings . beer drinking may be regarded by many as a german national sport , but consumption per head of the amber nectar actually dropped slightly to 108 lites last year . czechs expected to be out in front bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite the introduction of new flavors , german beer sales dropped no 2008 figures are available yet for the czech republic , but the czechs are expected to have comfortably defended their position as the world 's top quaffers .
in 2007 , per capita consumption stood at 159 liters of beer . while two percent more of the beverage flowed from austrian taps in 2008 , beer consumption dropped among britons , still regarded as some of the world 's most avid alcohol drinkers .
sales figures in belgium and the netherlands also fell , the brewery association said on monday . despite the good news for austrian beer sellers , there are also fears that the country 's thirst for suds may be quenched somewhat by the global financial crisis .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .

a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .

coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .

23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 23.02.2009 expert : german economy could shrink by over five percent großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : volkswagen became the latest company to say it 's reducing working hours germany 's deutsche bank warned on monday the country 's economy could contract by more than five percent this year as europe 's largest economy sinks into its worst recession in decades . in an interview with the bild newspaper on monday , feb .
23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .
volkswagen became the latest carmaker to announce that around two-thirds of its 92,000 employees will have their working hours reduced this week as new car production continues to slide .

walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .
volkswagen became the latest carmaker to announce that around two-thirds of its 92,000 employees will have their working hours reduced this week as new car production continues to slide .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .

23 , deutsche bank 's chief economist norbert walter said germany had to be prepared for a dramatic decline in economic output as the global downturn batters exports , decimates companies ' profits and raises the specter of large-scale job losses .
walter said a five-percent contraction is actually a fairly optimistic forecast , all things considered .
" the german economy will shrink by five percent in 2009 only if we have a real upswing in the summer , " walter told the paper .
" it can not be ruled out that this upswing will not come .
therefore , a worse result than this -lrb- five-percent contraction -rrb- can no longer be excluded , " he said .
his comments came as germany 's main stock index , the dax , slipped to 3,936.45 at closing time in frankfurt on monday , the first time in four years that it has closed lower than 4,000 .
since the beginning of the year , the top 30 german shares have lost an average 16 percent of their value .
experts predict jump in joblessness bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dax on monday slipped to its lowest point in four years walter 's prognosis is much worse than the german government 's own forecast that the economy will contract by between two and two-and-a-half percent this year .
data released earlier this month showed that the german economy shrank by 2.1 percent in the final quarter of 2008 , the biggest slump in 20 years .
germany officially entered recession in the third quarter of 2008 after two successive three-month periods of negative growth .
walter 's gloomy forecast was echoed by thomas straubhaar , head of the hamburg institute of international economics .
" we , too , expect a contraction of over three percent in our next prognosis , " straubhaar told german public broadcaster mdr , adding that he expected unemployment in germany to rise to four million this year and inflation to jump sharply by 2010 .
" this is the price we 'll pay for the fact that we 're now trying in the short-term to prevent the world from lurching from a recession to a depression , " he said .
a poll of top economists published monday by the financial times deutschland predicted that 800,000 more people could be out of work by the end of next year .
german chancellor angela merkel 's government this month passed the second of two economic stimulus packages designed to lift the economy out its slump by pumping public money into infrastructure projects and reducing taxes .
but the government remains under pressure to prop up tottering banks and inject aid into faltering companies in a bid to stave off large-scale layoffs .
volkswagen became the latest carmaker to announce that around two-thirds of its 92,000 employees will have their working hours reduced this week as new car production continues to slide .

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 61,000 vw workers in five different plants have been given an enforced five-day break in response to poor sales forecasts . the step comes as the global financial crisis continues to hit the entire car sector hard .
with sales expected to drop by around 10 percent in 2009 , vw has put around two-thirds of its employees on short-time to avoid over-production .
the company said that its research and development department and parts of its components manufacturing section would remain unaffected by the measure that starts on monday , feb .
23 .
the vw works council agreed to the step .
" it is necessary to react to the different market circumstances , " it said in a statement .

production had already been halted at the site between mid december and mid january .
other german car manufacturers , such as bmw and daimler , have already brought in short-time work . meanwhile , the future of germany 's opel remains uncertain .
an opel spokesman said in german radio on sunday that the company would present a plan in the next few days intended to overhaul the business and stave off imminent collapse .
chancellor angela merkel and the country 's new economics minister karl-theoder zu guttenberg -lrb- csu -rrb- have said the carmaker , a subsidiary of the ailing us firm general motors , would only receive state assistance if it put forward a feasible restructuring plan .
european solution for opel ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the situation at opel remains bleak but foreign minister and vice chancellor frank-walter steinmeier -lrb- spd -rrb- also stressed on sunday that germany should avoid going it alone in its support for the rüsselheim-based company .
he is in favor of a european solution for opel .
this sentiment was echoed by the opel works council klaus franz in german radio deutschlandfunk on monday . the german federation of family owned businesses , asu , spoke out against state assistance for opel on monday .
albrecht von hagen , the managing director of the lobby organization for small to medium sized enterprises , warned that it would distort the market .
" if the state helps opel out , what is going to happen in other businesses , let 's say ford or volkswagen ?
would n't that put them in a very trying situation , " von hagen told the public broadcaster zdf .
he said that it would be difficult to explain to vw workers that they were less well-off because opel was selling more cars as a result of state aid . author : julie gregson -lrb- ap / afp -rrb- editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .

and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "

" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "

" i think we could have a rough start but we need to move ahead with the peace process because the two-state solution road is narrowing and we ca n't afford the luxury of waiting , " said the czech republic 's europe minister alexander vondra on monday , feb .
23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

23 , at a meeting with the eu 's 27 foreign ministers in brussels .
the czech republic currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
asked about the prospects of a coalition headed by hard-line likud party leader benjamin netanyahu , swedish foreign minister carl bildt said that the eu should push netanyahu not to enter into a coalition which would call the two-state solution into question .
" i think it 's very important that we send a strong signal that that is not going to be acceptable , " he said .
nevertheless , eu foreign policy chief javier solana stressed that the bloc was " ready to cooperate with the government elected by the people . "
" i think the time for crisis management is over and we have to -lrb- focus on -rrb- conflict resolution as soon as possible , " solana said .
solana plans to tour the middle east this week , ahead of a march 2 gaza donors ' conference in egypt .
eu officials also urged israel to re-open border crossings into the gaza strip , with bildt saying that " reconstruction without ending the siege is useless . "
coalition negotiations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni is now playing a queenmaker role israeli president shimon peres asked hard-liner netanyahu to form the next israeli cabinet last friday , after holding consultations with the country 's party leaders .
although the centrist kadima party won 28 seats in the election , one more than the likud , a majority of factions recommended netanyahu for the premiership as he stands a better chance of cobbling together a coalition by an april 3 deadline .
but so far , benjamin netanyahu has failed to persuade his top rivals such as outgoing foreign minister tzipi livni to join his cabinet , increasing the chances of a right-wing israeli coalition likely to brake the sputtering middle east peace talks .
her first attempt to become israel 's second woman prime minister scuppered , livni shot down netanyahu 's invitation for her kadima party to enter his government , although she did agree to meet him for further talks .
" we did n't reach any agreement , " livni told reporters on sunday .
" there is an essential divergence and we have to clarify if there is a possible common path .
we did n't make progress on any essential subjects , " livni said .
anticipating the eu 's concerns , she said the main difference centered on the principle of a two-state solution to the israeli-palestinian conflict , which livni supports .
" on the essential subject for arriving at a -lrb- coalition -rrb- agreement - that there should be two states for two peoples and a final accord with the palestinians - there is no agreement , " said livni .
israeli 's unstable political landscape bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ehud barak said his moderate party would rather be in opposition netanyahu can almost certainly count on support from fellow right-wingers for a 65-bloc in the 120-member parliament , but is widely believed to favor a broad coalition that would have better survival chances .
a right-wing alliance , he believes , would be unlikely to last a full term and would put israel at odds with us president barack obama , who has vowed to vigorously pursue peace talks .
on monday , netanyahu met with the head of center-left labour , outgoing defense minister ehud barak , to try to entice him into his cabinet by offering him the defense again as well as four other ministries , according to local media .
barak rejected the offer , saying that his dovish party will serve as a " responsible , serious and constructive opposition . "
barak has consistently maintained that he would take labour - the veteran party that put up its worst-ever performance in the february 10 election with just 13 seats - into opposition .
israel 's system of proportional representation usually forces premiers to secure coalition partners among the myriad of smaller parties , resulting in governments that are notoriously unstable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 23.02.2009 european court of human rights celebrates fifty years of growth großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court currently faces a docket crisis feb .
23 marks the 50th anniversary of the european court of human rights , the continent 's foremost human-rights watchdog based in strasbourg . the european court of human rights was established in 1959 to protect civil and political rights when the horrors of previous decades were still fresh in europe 's mind .
the aim was to provide a basis of trust and solidarity to burgeoning european unification and provide a safeguard against any erosion of human beings ' basic rights and dignity .
it proved so successful that since its inception , the court has seen its case load brought by individuals , organizations and nations grow to some 100,000 cases from 46 countries .
these days , in fact , the court faces a serious backlog .
critics argue that it has become a victim of its own success - a result of the growing number of states subject to its jurisdiction , a good reputation , expansive interpretations of individual liberties , distrust of domestic judiciaries in some countries and entrenched human rights problems in others .
theoretically , however , the court 's success - even the backlog - should be welcomed .
" it 's a very good sign , " said renate jaeger , a judge from germany .
" obviously one negative effect is that we are overloaded with work .
but basically we can hardly hold it against our citizens that they want to avail themselves of their rights when they feel their human rights have been infringed upon . "
allegations of human-rights abuses can range from discrimination to the improper conduct of trials and the mistreatment of prisoners .
the court will only hear a case when all domestic legal options have been exhausted .
on a national level , countries are expected to comply with the court 's verdict , although the body has no power to actually enforce it . impartiality currently , the court is witnessing a flurry of cases filed from south ossetians .
by late 2008 , the court had received nearly 2,000 applications from people complaining of illegal treatment at the hands of georgia during the brief war with russia last summer .
russia has also made complaints against georgia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court is headquartered in luxembourg " there will be a massive increase in the workload of the court , " the court 's president , jean-paul costa , told reuters late last year .
" we can not just throw away these cases . "
" the european court of human rights is not there to pronounce judgment on questions of war and peace , " he said .
" the court can not made political judgments in conflict situations . "
the court also handles cases filed by individuals who stand accused of human rights abuses themselves - from suspected islamic militants to terrorist carlos the jackal and kurdish rebel leader abdullah ocalan .
the court was established and is overseen by the council of europe , a pan-european human rights body , and is not a branch of the european union .

after heads of europe 's largest economies met in berlin at the weekend to hammer out a joint european stance for the group of 20 meeting in april , europe 's media agreed on the need to press ahead with market reforms . in their editorials kicking off the week , european newspapers echoed demands voiced at the weekend 's european economic summit to get tough with tax havens and introduce sweeping reforms to avoid future economic meltdowns , but expressed skepticism about follow-through .
in london , the times pointed out that the economic summit served as a reminder that it is time for eu countries to set aside their differences .
" europe is beset by bickering now , when it most needs strong , co-ordinated leadership , " it wrote in its online edition .
" but france and germany disagree .
gordon brown 's relations with angela merkel are fraying ...
above all , however , eu leaders , and especially britain , need to strengthen ties with germany .
the coalition in berlin , facing a general election -lsb- in september -rsb- , is preoccupied with domestic politics .
but mr brown should build on the berlin meeting to remind the cabinet that germany is , and must remain , a vital ally for everyone in europe . "
" the scale of the crisis has one advantage , " concedes the widely-read french daily le journal la haute-marne based in chaumont .
" it reconciles the various european stances - regardless of ideologies .
the common denominator is regulation , and from now on , the targets are tax havens .
whether left-wing or right-wing , all governments are aware that tax havens were a boon to irregularities within the international financial markets .
and that they 're ready to resume their sinister work as soon as the crisis is over . even liberal britain now appears to be siding with the countries demanding tighter regulation , and sanctions for anyone who refuses to stick to the rules . "
over in amsterdam , left-leaning dutch daily trouw focused on proposals for a common bond issue among the 16 countries that use the euro .
" one idea that was not discussed in berlin even though it has a growing number of advocates , is that of a european treasury bond guaranteed by all eu states , " it wrote on monday .
" on saturday , the imf also pledged support for such a plan .
until now , countries within the euro-zone that enjoy less trust on the financial stage than others , have had to pay higher interest on loans .
this could be avoided with the help of such an eu bond . "
the financial times deutschland , meanwhile , was in finger-wagging mode : " how far the new us government will be willing to go with new transparency laws on hedge funds and rating agencies will be more decisive than european unity , " it cautioned .
" everything suggests that barack obama 's approach is closer to the european one that his predecessor 's was , but nevertheless , the us , like france , recently exhibited protectionist tendencies that jeopardize this ambitious project .
and even were every one of europe 's demands to be met , the world would not be immune to financial crises .
the current financial tsunami was not only triggered by supervisory deficiencies and wrong bonus systems .
for as long as regulators fail to do the job properly , tighter regulation is not the solution . "

" that continues to put germany among countries with the biggest gender wage inequalities , " spidla told newspaper die welt . he added that the latest figures show that the wage gap between men and women in germany for 2007 had not changed significantly from the previous year . only austria , the netherlands , cyprus , the czech republic and estonia pay their female employees less , the commissioner said . spidla calls for " equal pay for equal work " spidla said a major reason for the wage inequality in germany was the high proportion of women working part time or in low-paying jobs . spidla , a former prime minister of the czech republic , called on employers to adopt a " equal pay for equal work " policy and urged them to take on qualified women for leadership positions . it 's important for companies to use women 's potential particularly in tough economic times , spidla said , adding that eu statistics showed that , on average , women in the bloc were better educated than men . bettina schleicher , the deputy chairman of the german women 's council , told the ap news agency that the latest eu figures were bad news for germany 's image as a place to do business . " you ca n't advise young women to go abroad if they pursue a career , " schleicher said , adding that gender clichés in germany - whereby women were expected to stay at home and take care of the family - were largely to blame . christel humme , deputy chairman of the social democrats ' parliamentary group , urged the government to forge " clear and binding legal rules " to tackle wage inequalities . author : sonia phalnikar editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

0600 that ends our live text coverage of the 81st academy awards .
the event will be remembered for the success of slumdog millionaire , kate winslet finally breaking her oscars duck and heath ledger 's posthumous award .
the ceremony was slick , quick and , with hugh jackman in control , appeared to do the trick .
thanks for joining us and see you again soon for more live text .
0559 the bbc 's neil smith writes : and that , as the woman in charge of the press interview room says , is a wrap .
0557 the bbc 's neil smith writes : " hello , bbc ! " grins danny boyle as i stand up to ask why he decided to bring the young stars of slumdog millionaire to hollywood 's biggest night .
" we were very concerned about it distorting their lives , " he explains .
" they 're young , they need to be at school and the awards season is long .
but someone told me they will put the experience into their memory bank and you should not deny them that .
we tried to make the film like a family unit and having them here makes it feel like a family - it makes the night deeply special for all of us . "
the trainspotting man is beaming and ecstatic , quoting both w h auden and albert einstein and begging the assembled throng to thank his agent on his behalf .
no problem , danny .
anything else we can do , you just let us know. howardr2 tweets : oscarcast was the best in years .
mostly solid choices , entertaining -lrb- steve martin and tina fey were terrific -rrb- , and it ended on time.read howardr2 tweets frenchy , hants , says : oh yes , we did it .
an amazing night for british film all round .
hats off to curious case of benjamin button , you fought a good fight but slumdog the underdog swept the board .
overall a good oscars 09 .
0549 the bbc 's colin paterson says : it was a totally different type of show .
for the first time since 1985 when jack lemmon hosted it , it was n't hosted by a comedian .
there was a round stage so the audience were very close to the performers .
it felt quite pacy for the first hour , it really slackened off in the second hour , but then it got exciting again in the last hour .
i think hugh jackman will probably get pretty good reviews for his performances .
0543 outside the vanity fair party , former best actor award winner robert de niro wishes sean penn " every success " .
0542 only seven films have taken more oscars than slumdog .
leading on 11 are ben-hur , titanic and the lord of the rings : the return of the king .
on 10 is west side story , followed by the english patient , gigi and the last emperor on nine .
0538 slumdog millionaire , which took eight oscars , is in some esteemed company .
gone with the wind , from here to eternity , on the waterfront , my fair lady , gandhi , amadeus and cabaret are the other films to achieve this result .
0535 the bbc 's neil smith writes : with the ceremony done and dusted , we 've now had both best actors come through what is now a rather exhausted-looking press room .
here are a few snippets from what they told us : - a thrilled kate winslet said she " really does n't care " how the press in the uk react to her victory .
-lrb- " it makes me sad when people back home ca n't be happy for one of their kind , " she sighs before jumping off the podium to give daily mail reporter baz bamigboye a hug . -rrb-
she also had a message for her parents ' local paper , who last put a winslet on its pages when her mother won a pickled onion competition : " here 's your next winslet picture , reading evening post ! " - sean penn tells the anti-gay activists who picketed the kodak before the ceremony that they should " turn in their hate card and find their better self . "
-lrb- " it 's a demonstration of emotional cowardice to be so afraid of extending the same rights to their fellow men they would want for themselves . " -rrb-
he also paid tribute to fellow nominee mickey rourke , calling him " one of the great poetic talents in acting we have .
" he 's someone i 've looked up to , directed and admired , " he explained .
" throughout most of the wrestler he had me weeping . " 0532 many of the top celebs are heading to the vanity fair party .
robert downey jr , who was nominated in the best supporting actor category , has just arrived .
he 's not talking to the press. writegrrl tweets : wow !
i thought that was the best oscar show in recent memory .
beautiful stage - and i loved the group presenters .
good job !
read writegrrl tweets 0519 singer and actress madonna says slumdog millionaire was " brilliant in every way " , as the press scramble for comments from the celebrities now beginning to arrive at the vanity fair party .
ritesh , india , says : long-awaited oscar came to india as a r rahman receives it .
a day people of india will remember throughout their lives while eight oscars to a film which reveals true life and love of india .
0515 best actor oscar winner sean penn , who played gay politician harvey milk , says protesters outside the theatre held up " hateful signs " .
he urges them to find " their better self " .
0512 asked how she felt about husband sam mendes directing sex scenes involving her in the reader , kate winslet says : " he 's used to it .
he 'd seen me naked before i 'd even met him -lsb- in films -rsb- , for god 's sake . " 0508 these may be difficult economic times , but try telling that to the caterers .
as well as smoked salmon served on slices of bread cut in oscar statuette shapes , guests at this evening 's governor 's ball will be served three-inch high chocolates covered in powdered 24 carat gold .
0507 kate winslet tells a press conference that winning an oscar is " really a lot better " than losing .
she adds that she is an " unlikely hero " .
0501 it 's been a good night for the british film industry , thanks mainly to slumdog millionaire and , of course , kate winslet .
hugh jackman was a polished performer as host , putting on quite a baz luhrmann-inspired show .
the whole thing lasted just under three-and-a-half hours .
0458 the ceremony is over .
now the thousands of film folk gathered in and around the kodak theatre will head off the after-show parties .
first up is the governor 's ball .
0455 slumdog producer christian colson says the script inspired " mad love " and that director danny boyle is a " genius " .
paul , oxford , says : never , in the world of oscar have i been so depressed .
sean penn 's performance was good .
yes mickey rourke has upset the community , but it has been many , many years since i saw a performance as real and genuinely engaging as his performance in ' the wrestler ' - i 'm not shocked , but horribly disappointed at the seeming politics of hollywood .
a true shame .
0453 the oscar for best picture goes to slumdog millionaire .

kudos to sean penn , but having seen randy the ram in action at the spirits yesterday we 've all been denied one hell of an acceptance speech .
a o scott blogs on the carpetbagger , new york times : it looks like they might bring this one in at under three hours , so i 'll curb my complaining .
and i 'll close by noting that this seemed not only like a relatively brief oscar ceremony , but a small one .

penn was second favourite after mickey rourke .

her fellow nominees are " goddesses " , especially meryl streep .
no tears - just about .
0436 the bbc 's neil smith writes : slumdog millionaire editor chris dickens enters the press room just as danny boyle is named best director .
" a year ago we had no idea that we 'd be here , " said the british craftsman , a dead ringer for singer moby .
" i thought the writer and director would get a few awards , but i never imagined we 'd have so many of us up here . " 0434 winslet goes up on stage to speak .
she says she has been making a version of this address since before she was eight years old .
winslet thanks her friends and family .
she asks her dad to whistle .
he does so and she waves to him .
0431 britain 's kate winslet has finally won an oscar .
after five previous nominations she is best actress for her role in the reader .
the crowd goes wild .
daniela , ottawa , says : i was actually entertained by the oscars this year !
three hours in and i 'm not asleep yet .
great show and a great host !
good job this year , oscars .
stephen , glasgow , says : the show seems a little rushed this year , but jackman 's done a surprisingly good job .
makes a refreshing change from the usual american ' comics ' who try far too hard for laughs .
0427 now for the best actress award .
as with the best supporting actor and actress oscars , five former recipients are on stage .
is it kate winslet 's year at last ? 0426 the bbc 's neil smith writes : still beaming as he enters the press room , sound engineer resul pookutty says winning the best sound oscar for slumdog millionaire is " an absolute glory for me and my country " .
" in 80 years of academy history , no indian technician has been nominated for an oscar .

the team working on slumdog " dwarf even the sky " , he adds .
0423 the bbc 's neil smith writes : the japanese journalists on my table are having a terrific night .
not only did one of their countrymen win the best animated short prize , but they 've just seen japanese film departures -lrb- okuributo -rrb- beat hotly tipped contenders the class and waltz with bashir to the foreign language film award .

0422 danny boyle has done it .

it seems to me this film , although a frontrunner , is not going to go home with many oscar trophies .
the feeling is there 's a lot of goodwill towards slumdog millionaire tonight .
everybody is waiting for the best actress category - kate winslet is tipped to win but she is up against meryl streep who has been nominated 15 times .
people think it will go to kate winslet , but meryl streep may get it .

anyway , the best original song oscar goes to ar rahman - again - and gulzar for slumdog millionaire 's jai ho .

ross stevenson , glasgow , says : good on the academy for giving the oscar to heath ledger .
it was well deserved whether he died or not .
it would have been easy for them to pass him over but i 'm very glad they did n't , i honestly think his performance as the joker was the best of the past 12 months .
given the weight of his role in the dark knight it really should have been best actor though as opposed to best supporting actor .
0330 smith gets a little tongue-tied as he lists the nominees for the sound editing oscar .
it goes to the dark knight 's richard king .
0328 after a short film showcasing hollywood 's skill at special effects and action scenes , will smith - who is an academy member - is on stage to talk about it .

0316 heath ledger 's mother , father and sister accept the oscar on his behalf .
his father describes it as " humbling " .
the award would have " validated " his son professionally , he adds .
the actor 's mother says it is time to celebrate his achievements .
his sister says she wishes he was still here .
0312 the bbc 's neil smith writes : simon beaufoy tells the press room it was " absolutely right " to bring the young stars of slumdog millionaire over for the oscars .
" we were so worried about bringing them over ; we wondered , would it seem inappropriate ?
but they were completely cool about it , running around having a laugh .
in the end it was absolutely the right thing to do . "
the winner of the adapted screenplay award also said it was " a real shock " to have the oscar , " this iconic image of cinema , " in his hand .
" for a while no one wanted slumdog millionaire ; now it 's going to be written on the walls of this place . "
beaufoy revealed the film-makers had " taken lot of flack for showing the slums in mumbai , which bollywood does n't do .
the fact we did and audiences in india are going to see it has opened up new cinematic pathways for indian directors .
imagine if hollywood and bollywood combined - that would be incredibly exciting . " 0307 heath ledger , who died last year , becomes only the second man to win an acting oscar posthumously .

bipin , manhattan says : i am from the sub-continent and all of my friends that i have talked with say that there is nothing special about slumdog millionaire but what we are forgetting is that the sort of scenario the movie portrays is completely unknown to the people especially in the west .
so i think that 's the reason for its popularity .
0219 sex and the city 's sarah jessica parker and 007 daniel craig present the art direction statuette for the curious case of benjamin button , for which brad pitt is nominated in the best actor category .

bbc news -pipe- entertainment -pipe- jackman on song at his first oscars bbc news / entertainment graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- entertainment contents : arts & culture 06:56 gmt , monday , 23 february 2009 jackman on song at his first oscars by ben sutherland entertainment reporter , bbc news it was a fresh presenter and a fresh approach for the 81st academy awards .
but how much difference did it make ?
we had been promised a transformed show this year , not least because it was time for a new host .
for 2009 the academy had turned to hugh jackman - best known as wolverine from the x-men films , but also a renowned musical theatre actor - to provide the showstopping performance that has eluded the likes of jon stewart and chris rock in recent years .
how did jackman do ?
well , it is almost unfair to judge - given that he got so little stage time .
he started with a couple of witty lines - " everything is being downsized because of the recession ; next year i 'll be starring in a movie called new zealand " being the best .
but after that , aside from a couple of " how great was that ? " links , the sum total of jackman 's presentation amounted to two song and dance routines .
standing ovation not that they were bad .
the first was exactly the sort of thing billy crystal used to open the show with , except that in a nod to these credit crunched times , the expensive cgi crystal used to use to insert himself into the nominated films was replaced by deliberately junky-looking sets .
and the second number , in which jackman and beyonce knowles performed a medley of hits from oscar-winning musicals put together by baz luhrmann , was spectacular - and fully deserving of its standing ovation .
but ultimately jackman brought to mind dame judi dench in shakespeare in love all those years back - taking the limelight for effectively eight minutes ' work in a three-hour production .
on the other hand , he had much less to play with than previous hosts .
there was no chance to ad-lib , for example .
with a deliberate effort made to make the show run shorter , the number of guest presenters was slashed , with many of them handing out multiple gongs .
indeed , no less than four oscars were given out by will smith .
" yes , they still have me here .
hugh must be napping , " the hancock star deadpanned .
however , with these big numbers at the front and the big awards at the end , there was a real risk of the show sagging badly in the middle .
thank goodness , then , for the unseen stars on the night - the writers , including british comic star ricky gervais .
they came up with some great gags for the guest presenters , who now found themselves effectively taking on some of the work formally done by the host .
particularly fine was a long post-modern sequence for the scriptwriting gongs .
it was both impressively innovative in terms of presentation , and had , in steve martin and tina fey , a brilliant double act in control .
" it has been said that to write is to live forever , " fey said .
" the man who wrote that is dead , " martin replied .
it was the sort of thing that made you wish martin would give up nonsense like the pink panther 2 and work with people who can actually write comedy .
commendably , there were some other nice tweaks - like the medley of best scores , or queen latifah 's live singing of i 'll be seeing you over the death roll .
meanwhile , another positive was that there was just a little more irreverence , perhaps as a result of the realisation that in these troubled times , the oscars are , ultimately , just a fancy awards ceremony .
hence there were numerous references from the likes of jackman , seth rogan and jack black to the fact that action and comedy films very rarely get acknowledged , despite their huge popularity and box office .
cheeky gags black was in particularly fine form .
asked by co-presenter jennifer aniston how he got so rich off his animated work , he replied : " each year i do one dreamworks project , then i take the money to the oscars and bet it on pixar . "
the envelope was then opened , promptly revealing pixar 's wall-e had won - beating black 's own kung fu panda .
his reaction was somewhere between a cheer and a colossal eye-roll .
even sean penn - who a few years back strongly chided chris rock on stage for his light-hearted ribbing of fellow actor jude law - felt he could laugh at himself : " i do know how hard i make it to appreciate me , " he said .
and there were a couple of cheeky gags just for the hollywood insider - such as when the camera picked out angelina jolie during jennifer aniston 's presentation , or liam neeson presenting best foreign film having just starred in taken , which featured the most stereotypical " foreign types " since asterix the gaul started touring europe .
" i do n't know what it looks like on television , but here in the room it 's bloody wonderful , " danny boyle said .
fun , danny , that 's your answer .
fun .

but how much difference did it make ?
we had been promised a transformed show this year , not least because it was time for a new host .
for 2009 the academy had turned to hugh jackman - best known as wolverine from the x-men films , but also a renowned musical theatre actor - to provide the showstopping performance that has eluded the likes of jon stewart and chris rock in recent years .
how did jackman do ?
well , it is almost unfair to judge - given that he got so little stage time .
he started with a couple of witty lines - " everything is being downsized because of the recession ; next year i 'll be starring in a movie called new zealand " being the best .
but after that , aside from a couple of " how great was that ? " links , the sum total of jackman 's presentation amounted to two song and dance routines .
standing ovation not that they were bad .
the first was exactly the sort of thing billy crystal used to open the show with , except that in a nod to these credit crunched times , the expensive cgi crystal used to use to insert himself into the nominated films was replaced by deliberately junky-looking sets .
and the second number , in which jackman and beyonce knowles performed a medley of hits from oscar-winning musicals put together by baz luhrmann , was spectacular - and fully deserving of its standing ovation .
but ultimately jackman brought to mind dame judi dench in shakespeare in love all those years back - taking the limelight for effectively eight minutes ' work in a three-hour production .
on the other hand , he had much less to play with than previous hosts .
there was no chance to ad-lib , for example .
with a deliberate effort made to make the show run shorter , the number of guest presenters was slashed , with many of them handing out multiple gongs .
indeed , no less than four oscars were given out by will smith .
" yes , they still have me here .
hugh must be napping , " the hancock star deadpanned .
jackman was joined by beyonce for a musical number however , with these big numbers at the front and the big awards at the end , there was a real risk of the show sagging badly in the middle .
thank goodness , then , for the unseen stars on the night - the writers , including british comic star ricky gervais .
they came up with some great gags for the guest presenters , who now found themselves effectively taking on some of the work formally done by the host .
particularly fine was a long post-modern sequence for the scriptwriting gongs .
it was both impressively innovative in terms of presentation , and had , in steve martin and tina fey , a brilliant double act in control .
" it has been said that to write is to live forever , " fey said .
" the man who wrote that is dead , " martin replied .
it was the sort of thing that made you wish martin would give up nonsense like the pink panther 2 and work with people who can actually write comedy .
commendably , there were some other nice tweaks - like the medley of best scores , or queen latifah 's live singing of i 'll be seeing you over the death roll .
meanwhile , another positive was that there was just a little more irreverence , perhaps as a result of the realisation that in these troubled times , the oscars are , ultimately , just a fancy awards ceremony .
jennifer aniston and jack black added some laughs to the show hence there were numerous references from the likes of jackman , seth rogan and jack black to the fact that action and comedy films very rarely get acknowledged , despite their huge popularity and box office .
cheeky gags black was in particularly fine form .
asked by co-presenter jennifer aniston how he got so rich off his animated work , he replied : " each year i do one dreamworks project , then i take the money to the oscars and bet it on pixar . "
the envelope was then opened , promptly revealing pixar 's wall-e had won - beating black 's own kung fu panda .
his reaction was somewhere between a cheer and a colossal eye-roll .
even sean penn - who a few years back strongly chided chris rock on stage for his light-hearted ribbing of fellow actor jude law - felt he could laugh at himself : " i do know how hard i make it to appreciate me , " he said .
and there were a couple of cheeky gags just for the hollywood insider - such as when the camera picked out angelina jolie during jennifer aniston 's presentation , or liam neeson presenting best foreign film having just starred in taken , which featured the most stereotypical " foreign types " since asterix the gaul started touring europe .
" i do n't know what it looks like on television , but here in the room it 's bloody wonderful , " danny boyle said .
fun , danny , that 's your answer .
fun .

but how much difference did it make ?
we had been promised a transformed show this year , not least because it was time for a new host .
for 2009 the academy had turned to hugh jackman - best known as wolverine from the x-men films , but also a renowned musical theatre actor - to provide the showstopping performance that has eluded the likes of jon stewart and chris rock in recent years .
how did jackman do ?
well , it is almost unfair to judge - given that he got so little stage time .
he started with a couple of witty lines - " everything is being downsized because of the recession ; next year i 'll be starring in a movie called new zealand " being the best .
but after that , aside from a couple of " how great was that ? " links , the sum total of jackman 's presentation amounted to two song and dance routines .
standing ovation not that they were bad .
the first was exactly the sort of thing billy crystal used to open the show with , except that in a nod to these credit crunched times , the expensive cgi crystal used to use to insert himself into the nominated films was replaced by deliberately junky-looking sets .
and the second number , in which jackman and beyonce knowles performed a medley of hits from oscar-winning musicals put together by baz luhrmann , was spectacular - and fully deserving of its standing ovation .
but ultimately jackman brought to mind dame judi dench in shakespeare in love all those years back - taking the limelight for effectively eight minutes ' work in a three-hour production .
on the other hand , he had much less to play with than previous hosts .
there was no chance to ad-lib , for example .
with a deliberate effort made to make the show run shorter , the number of guest presenters was slashed , with many of them handing out multiple gongs .
indeed , no less than four oscars were given out by will smith .
" yes , they still have me here .
hugh must be napping , " the hancock star deadpanned .
jackman was joined by beyonce for a musical number however , with these big numbers at the front and the big awards at the end , there was a real risk of the show sagging badly in the middle .
thank goodness , then , for the unseen stars on the night - the writers , including british comic star ricky gervais .
they came up with some great gags for the guest presenters , who now found themselves effectively taking on some of the work formally done by the host .
particularly fine was a long post-modern sequence for the scriptwriting gongs .
it was both impressively innovative in terms of presentation , and had , in steve martin and tina fey , a brilliant double act in control .
" it has been said that to write is to live forever , " fey said .
" the man who wrote that is dead , " martin replied .
it was the sort of thing that made you wish martin would give up nonsense like the pink panther 2 and work with people who can actually write comedy .
commendably , there were some other nice tweaks - like the medley of best scores , or queen latifah 's live singing of i 'll be seeing you over the death roll .
meanwhile , another positive was that there was just a little more irreverence , perhaps as a result of the realisation that in these troubled times , the oscars are , ultimately , just a fancy awards ceremony .
jennifer aniston and jack black added some laughs to the show hence there were numerous references from the likes of jackman , seth rogan and jack black to the fact that action and comedy films very rarely get acknowledged , despite their huge popularity and box office .
cheeky gags black was in particularly fine form .
asked by co-presenter jennifer aniston how he got so rich off his animated work , he replied : " each year i do one dreamworks project , then i take the money to the oscars and bet it on pixar . "
the envelope was then opened , promptly revealing pixar 's wall-e had won - beating black 's own kung fu panda .
his reaction was somewhere between a cheer and a colossal eye-roll .
even sean penn - who a few years back strongly chided chris rock on stage for his light-hearted ribbing of fellow actor jude law - felt he could laugh at himself : " i do know how hard i make it to appreciate me , " he said .
and there were a couple of cheeky gags just for the hollywood insider - such as when the camera picked out angelina jolie during jennifer aniston 's presentation , or liam neeson presenting best foreign film having just starred in taken , which featured the most stereotypical " foreign types " since asterix the gaul started touring europe .
" i do n't know what it looks like on television , but here in the room it 's bloody wonderful , " danny boyle said .
fun , danny , that 's your answer .

the star 's success came for her role in the reader , capping a number of prizes leading up to the oscars .
" i get very emotional about these things , " said winslet at a recent hollywood event .
" i 'm too emotional to lose , and i 'm too emotional to win . "
the 33 year-old 's remarks came in the wake of this year 's golden globe awards , which saw her take home two statuettes , and the screen actors guild awards where she was also recognised .
her contrasting roles in the reader and revolutionary road secured a double triumph at the globes .
winslet had two nominations in the best actress category at the british academy film awards - with her role in the reader beating her part in revolutionary road .
disturbed born in reading , berkshire in 1975 , kate elizabeth winslet has enjoyed a varied and successful career .
she began acting in the bbc 's children 's science fiction serial dark season in 1991 , making further small screen appearances in casualty and anglo-saxon attitudes .
winslet married film and theatre director sam mendes in 2003 but it was not until 1993 that she moved to the big screen , landing the role of juliet hulme in peter jackson 's heavenly creatures .
winslet 's performance as a disturbed teenager in 1950s new zealand saw her garlanded by both empire magazine and the london film critics ' circle .
that was followed in 1996 by sense and sensibility , a jane austen adaptation that proved to be a financial and critical success .
winslet scooped a bafta for her performance as the flighty marianne dashwood , which also saw her nominated for an oscar .
costume roles opposite christopher eccleston in jude and kenneth branagh in hamlet kept her in the public eye .
however , it was playing the impetuous rose dawson in 1997 's titanic that finally made her an international star .
tragedy james cameron 's film , a massive box-office hit , went on to win 11 oscars , though winslet herself was once more overlooked .
tragedy struck shortly afterwards when winslet 's partner of five years , actor and writer stephen tredre , died from bone cancer .
winslet was nominated for an emmy for her appearance in extras the actress wed director jim threapleton in 1998 , though their marriage ended in divorce three years later .
winslet tied the knot again in 2003 , this time with the oscar-winning director of american beauty , sam mendes .
their son , joe alfie winslet mendes , was born later that year , winslet having already had a daughter , mia honey , with threapleton .
winslet has never made any secret that she will always put her family first and has turned down roles because of it .
she was offered a part in woody allen 's 2005 film match point but declined it .
she also turned down the lead role in shakespeare in love , opting to appear in hideous kinky instead .
satirical but winslet 's ability has not been the only focus of press attention over the years .
the actress 's weight has always been a talking point , with winslet taking legal action on occasion against various magazines that have made claims about it .
in 2005 the actress returned to tv to star in an episode of ricky gervais 's comedy series extras .
the actress , who played a satirical version of herself , earned an emmy nomination for outstanding guest performance in a comedy series .
in addition to sense and sensibility , titanic and the reader , winslet received oscar nominations for iris , eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and little children .
hardly surprising , then , that many felt 2009 was kate winslet 's year .
after all , only one actress in history - veteran player thelma ritter of all about eve fame - was nominated as many times without actually winning .

the star 's success came for her role in the reader , capping a number of prizes leading up to the oscars .
" i get very emotional about these things , " said winslet at a recent hollywood event .
" i 'm too emotional to lose , and i 'm too emotional to win . "
the 33 year-old 's remarks came in the wake of this year 's golden globe awards , which saw her take home two statuettes , and the screen actors guild awards where she was also recognised .
her contrasting roles in the reader and revolutionary road secured a double triumph at the globes .
winslet had two nominations in the best actress category at the british academy film awards - with her role in the reader beating her part in revolutionary road .
disturbed born in reading , berkshire in 1975 , kate elizabeth winslet has enjoyed a varied and successful career .
she began acting in the bbc 's children 's science fiction serial dark season in 1991 , making further small screen appearances in casualty and anglo-saxon attitudes .
winslet married film and theatre director sam mendes in 2003 but it was not until 1993 that she moved to the big screen , landing the role of juliet hulme in peter jackson 's heavenly creatures .
winslet 's performance as a disturbed teenager in 1950s new zealand saw her garlanded by both empire magazine and the london film critics ' circle .
that was followed in 1996 by sense and sensibility , a jane austen adaptation that proved to be a financial and critical success .
winslet scooped a bafta for her performance as the flighty marianne dashwood , which also saw her nominated for an oscar .
costume roles opposite christopher eccleston in jude and kenneth branagh in hamlet kept her in the public eye .
however , it was playing the impetuous rose dawson in 1997 's titanic that finally made her an international star .
tragedy james cameron 's film , a massive box-office hit , went on to win 11 oscars , though winslet herself was once more overlooked .
tragedy struck shortly afterwards when winslet 's partner of five years , actor and writer stephen tredre , died from bone cancer .
winslet was nominated for an emmy for her appearance in extras the actress wed director jim threapleton in 1998 , though their marriage ended in divorce three years later .
winslet tied the knot again in 2003 , this time with the oscar-winning director of american beauty , sam mendes .
their son , joe alfie winslet mendes , was born later that year , winslet having already had a daughter , mia honey , with threapleton .
winslet has never made any secret that she will always put her family first and has turned down roles because of it .
she was offered a part in woody allen 's 2005 film match point but declined it .
she also turned down the lead role in shakespeare in love , opting to appear in hideous kinky instead .
satirical but winslet 's ability has not been the only focus of press attention over the years .
the actress 's weight has always been a talking point , with winslet taking legal action on occasion against various magazines that have made claims about it .
in 2005 the actress returned to tv to star in an episode of ricky gervais 's comedy series extras .
the actress , who played a satirical version of herself , earned an emmy nomination for outstanding guest performance in a comedy series .
in addition to sense and sensibility , titanic and the reader , winslet received oscar nominations for iris , eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and little children .
hardly surprising , then , that many felt 2009 was kate winslet 's year .
after all , only one actress in history - veteran player thelma ritter of all about eve fame - was nominated as many times without actually winning .
