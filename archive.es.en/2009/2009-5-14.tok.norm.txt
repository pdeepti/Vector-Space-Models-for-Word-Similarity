the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .

" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .
the hill-top site provides views of the jezreel valley , mount tabor and other sights in galilee .
it is here in northern israel , according to the bible 's new testament , that a crowd angered by his teachings tried to throw jesus off the cliff .

" let everyone reject the destructive power of hatred and prejudice , " large numbers of police were also deployed inside the town itself .
israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .
former prime minister ariel sharon eventually had the mosque 's illegally begun foundations destroyed in 2003 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9801 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support .
-lrb- 18.09.2008 -rrb- british parliament rejects changes in abortion law attempts by opposition conservatives to tighten britain 's liberal abortion laws were defeated late tuesday , may 20 , when parliament voted to leave the upper time limit for pregnancy termination at 24 weeks .
-lrb- 21.05.2008 -rrb- government discusses reducing late abortions parliamentary leaders met with church representatives tuesday to talk about reforming legislation on late abortions , as conservatives push for more stringent controls on terminations and a re-think of who foots the bill .

however , the greek data protection agency wants google to also specify how long it intends to keep its images online and what measures the search engine intends to take to inform residents who may be photographed of their rights .
the service , launched in the us two years ago , now covers nine countries , including italy , the netherlands , the united kingdom and spain .
google has said that it wants to expand its service to cover all of europe .
street view provides users a 360-degree view of the urban landscape via an icon on google maps .
users are given the option of zooming in to a given location in google maps and can then drag the icon located above the zoom bar to a given street .
upon zooming , users are given a picture view of the street and a 360-degree view of the area .
germany : tough opposition street view is not yet available for germany .
google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer recently told the magazine focus that " public opposition to google street view in germany , though not hysterical , had been tougher than in any country . "
fleischer said , however , that specific privacy tools will be developed for the german launch , which google is hoping will happen later this year .
the option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in germany .
google has faced complaints , similar to those in greece , in japan .
they led to the company agreeing to re-shoot all images in japan for street view .
google japan announced in a statement wednesday that it would lower cameras , installed on a car roof , after complaints that images were captured over fences and thus violated privacy . nda / ncy / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .
the hill-top site provides views of the jezreel valley , mount tabor and other sights in galilee .
it is here in northern israel , according to the bible 's new testament , that a crowd angered by his teachings tried to throw jesus off the cliff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff waves to worshippers from his popemobile " i urge people of goodwill in both communities to repair the damage that has been done , and ... to work to build bridges and find the way to a peaceful coexistence , " the pope said .
" let everyone reject the destructive power of hatred and prejudice , " large numbers of police were also deployed inside the town itself .
israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .
former prime minister ariel sharon eventually had the mosque 's illegally begun foundations destroyed in 2003 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the greek data protection agency wants google to also specify how long it intends to keep its images online and what measures the search engine intends to take to inform residents who may be photographed of their rights .
the service , launched in the us two years ago , now covers nine countries , including italy , the netherlands , the united kingdom and spain .
google has said that it wants to expand its service to cover all of europe .
street view provides users a 360-degree view of the urban landscape via an icon on google maps .
users are given the option of zooming in to a given location in google maps and can then drag the icon located above the zoom bar to a given street .
upon zooming , users are given a picture view of the street and a 360-degree view of the area .
germany : tough opposition street view is not yet available for germany .
google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer recently told the magazine focus that " public opposition to google street view in germany , though not hysterical , had been tougher than in any country . "
fleischer said , however , that specific privacy tools will be developed for the german launch , which google is hoping will happen later this year .
the option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in germany .
google has faced complaints , similar to those in greece , in japan .
they led to the company agreeing to re-shoot all images in japan for street view .
google japan announced in a statement wednesday that it would lower cameras , installed on a car roof , after complaints that images were captured over fences and thus violated privacy . nda / ncy / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .
lessons from abroad the study surveyed 19 state-run , church-owned and non-governmental organizations .
stockmann also said the system was marked by a lack of transparency in the way funds are spent on development projects .
he pointed out that the german ministry for economic cooperation and development was the only institution to publish its aid evaluation report online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany 's development aid policy needs to be better coordinated stockmann added that germany could learn some lessons from other countries in assessing aid projects .
" in sweden , for example , there is an independent agency for the evaluation of the efficacy of swedish development aid .
in britain there 's an advisory panel , which tells government which methods and even which programs and projects should be evaluated . "
eu slams germany for inflating aid figures germany 's aid budget this year amounts to about 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.85 billion -rrb- .
on top of that , non-governmental groups contribute nearly one billion euros yearly to fund development projects worldwide .
many aid groups and experts also fear a slump in germany 's development aid project as a result of the global financial crisis .
the world bank has warned that recession-induced donor fatigue could plunge 90 million more people , mainly in africa , into poverty .
on thursday , the umbrella organization for eu development aid , concord , criticized germany and other member states for inflating their development aid figures .
the group said that last year germany only spent 0.28 percent of gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- on actual aid for the developing world and not 0.38 percent as berlin had claimed .
the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .

" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community .

suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .

a deficit of at least 45 billion euros is expected in 2009 . the advisors offer an independent forecast every half year of how much revenue federal , state and local government can expect . the data is key to finance market expectations of germany 's borrowing activity .
according to the economic prognosis for this year , the government will have to make do with 527 billion euros - that 's 45 billion euros or 8.5 percent less since the last assessment was completed in november .
most of the unprecedented fallback is being blamed on the sharp downturn in the germany economy .
with a general election looming in september , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats have urged the party leader to promise tax cuts .
but senior officials within the ruling coalition have advised her to resist , arguing that the dip in revenue and a slate of anti-recession spending is likely to put government budgets under heavy strain .
finance minister decries tax cuts in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized talk of tax cuts emanating from the ranks of merkel 's christian democrats .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .
the hill-top site provides views of the jezreel valley , mount tabor and other sights in galilee .
it is here in northern israel , according to the bible 's new testament , that a crowd angered by his teachings tried to throw jesus off the cliff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff waves to worshippers from his popemobile " i urge people of goodwill in both communities to repair the damage that has been done , and ... to work to build bridges and find the way to a peaceful coexistence , " the pope said .
" let everyone reject the destructive power of hatred and prejudice , " large numbers of police were also deployed inside the town itself .
israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .
former prime minister ariel sharon eventually had the mosque 's illegally begun foundations destroyed in 2003 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .
the hill-top site provides views of the jezreel valley , mount tabor and other sights in galilee .

israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consequences are going to be dramatic for many countries , but especially for bangladesh .
the united nations international panel on climate change estimates that by the year 2050 nearly one fifth of the country will be submerged by water .
more than 30 million people will lose their livelihoods .
they will be forced to migrate to the north or to neighbouring countries . as the sea level rises , the flat south asian country of bangladesh is going to suffer disproportionately from increasingly frequent and strong storms , floods and drought .
mahaboob hasan from the bangladesh unnayan parishad environmental research institute in the capital dhaka says : " there will be intrusion of saline water due to the rise of sea level .
the entire agricultural ecosystem will be jeopardized .
rice is not tolerant to excess saline water .
that will really affect the food security of the people living in the coastal zone . "
wave of migrants expected when the rice and vegetable cultivations disappear under water , most small farmers and agricultural labourers will lose their main source of income .
experts predict that some 30 or 40 million people will start out for other parts of bangladesh .
this huge number of migrants will cause a humanitarian catastrophe in the already overpopulated country , says thomas hirsch from the german bread for the world development aid organisation .
" in a country like bangladesh which is extremely poor , climate refugees will end up living in miserable conditions in the big cities " , hirsch says .
" there will be hardly enough jobs to allow people to live decently .
very often , whole families , including children will have to work in dismal conditions only to survive . "
bangladesh has started looking for ways to tackle these ecological and social challenges along with international development organisations .
the common aim is to develop adaptation strategies that are locally acceptable .
thomas hirsch from bread for the world cites some of the issues locals have to deal with : " how can i prepare myself ?
by diversifying crops or using saline-resistant rice-species for example .
which other new sources of income may be possible if agriculture ceases to provide employment ?
what will i have to do if my only chance is migration ?
we are trying to find different ways out and to introduce long term sustainable strategies . "
the government of bangladesh has started afforestation projects in the country ’ s coastal areas .
elsewhere , dams are being built to stop saline water from coming in .
stone houses on stilts have been made to give people shelter in case of floods .
' exporting ' people but adaptation is not always the right choice , says climate expert mahaboob hasan .
he insists that people also have to be ready to seek a new life somewhere else .
" we are training the people so that they can go abroad " , hasan explains .
" labour is cheap in bangladesh and there is big demand in the middle east countries .
so we are just about to start action for short training and ' exporting ' them to the different countries . "
the tide of climate migrants will not stop within the borders of bangladesh .
therefore , experts are calling for more cooperation between neighbouring countries .
the responsibilities of the industrialised countries that are blamed for causing climate change remain an open question .

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .
lessons from abroad the study surveyed 19 state-run , church-owned and non-governmental organizations .
stockmann also said the system was marked by a lack of transparency in the way funds are spent on development projects .
he pointed out that the german ministry for economic cooperation and development was the only institution to publish its aid evaluation report online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany 's development aid policy needs to be better coordinated stockmann added that germany could learn some lessons from other countries in assessing aid projects .
" in sweden , for example , there is an independent agency for the evaluation of the efficacy of swedish development aid .
in britain there 's an advisory panel , which tells government which methods and even which programs and projects should be evaluated . "
eu slams germany for inflating aid figures germany 's aid budget this year amounts to about 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.85 billion -rrb- .
on top of that , non-governmental groups contribute nearly one billion euros yearly to fund development projects worldwide .
many aid groups and experts also fear a slump in germany 's development aid project as a result of the global financial crisis .
the world bank has warned that recession-induced donor fatigue could plunge 90 million more people , mainly in africa , into poverty .
on thursday , the umbrella organization for eu development aid , concord , criticized germany and other member states for inflating their development aid figures .
the group said that last year germany only spent 0.28 percent of gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- on actual aid for the developing world and not 0.38 percent as berlin had claimed .
the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .
concord said only three countries among the eu 's 27 member states – britain , luxembourg and spain – would meet the eu 's goal of pushing countries to raise their aid budget 0.56 percent of gdp . sp / ncy / kna / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .
lessons from abroad the study surveyed 19 state-run , church-owned and non-governmental organizations .
stockmann also said the system was marked by a lack of transparency in the way funds are spent on development projects .
he pointed out that the german ministry for economic cooperation and development was the only institution to publish its aid evaluation report online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany 's development aid policy needs to be better coordinated stockmann added that germany could learn some lessons from other countries in assessing aid projects .
" in sweden , for example , there is an independent agency for the evaluation of the efficacy of swedish development aid .
in britain there 's an advisory panel , which tells government which methods and even which programs and projects should be evaluated . "
eu slams germany for inflating aid figures germany 's aid budget this year amounts to about 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.85 billion -rrb- .
on top of that , non-governmental groups contribute nearly one billion euros yearly to fund development projects worldwide .
many aid groups and experts also fear a slump in germany 's development aid project as a result of the global financial crisis .
the world bank has warned that recession-induced donor fatigue could plunge 90 million more people , mainly in africa , into poverty .
on thursday , the umbrella organization for eu development aid , concord , criticized germany and other member states for inflating their development aid figures .
the group said that last year germany only spent 0.28 percent of gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- on actual aid for the developing world and not 0.38 percent as berlin had claimed .
the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .
concord said only three countries among the eu 's 27 member states – britain , luxembourg and spain – would meet the eu 's goal of pushing countries to raise their aid budget 0.56 percent of gdp . sp / ncy / kna / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .

he pointed out that the german ministry for economic cooperation and development was the only institution to publish its aid evaluation report online .

my husband , bob akard , and i returned to berlin for our 50th wedding anniversary which was hosted by the allied museum on clay allee .
many of our memories are now permanent items in that museum .
the tagesspiegel did a nice article about the event in 2004 .
i am now facing the biggest crisis of my life with a major cancer operation . i plan to live through this as i did the bombings of staat mitte in 1944-45 and the soviet blockade of berlin .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .

suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .
the hill-top site provides views of the jezreel valley , mount tabor and other sights in galilee .
it is here in northern israel , according to the bible 's new testament , that a crowd angered by his teachings tried to throw jesus off the cliff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pontiff waves to worshippers from his popemobile " i urge people of goodwill in both communities to repair the damage that has been done , and ... to work to build bridges and find the way to a peaceful coexistence , " the pope said .
" let everyone reject the destructive power of hatred and prejudice , " large numbers of police were also deployed inside the town itself .
israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .
former prime minister ariel sharon eventually had the mosque 's illegally begun foundations destroyed in 2003 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

australian federal court judge bruce lander sentenced the 65-year-old to three months in prison , saying that " evidence showed a continuing public defiance of the authority of the court . " following his sentencing , toben told reporters that he was ready to go to jail and was willing to do so " for the sake of free expression . " " the world is my prison , where can i run to ?

holocaust denial is a crime in germany , punishable by up to five years imprisonment . a british court ruled against extraditing him to germany . toben has previously been jailed in both germany and austria for declaring there were no mass killings of jews in world war ii . in 2006 he was a speaker at a controversial conference in tehran organized by the iranian government and attended by president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "

the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .

under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the greek data protection agency wants google to also specify how long it intends to keep its images online and what measures the search engine intends to take to inform residents who may be photographed of their rights .

google has said that it wants to expand its service to cover all of europe .

german doctors say john demjanjuk is in better shape than the average 89-year old and fit enough to remain in jail as he awaits charges . doctors who examined the suspected former nazi death camp guard after his arrival at the stadelheim jail in southern munich on tuesday , determined that he is fit to remain in custody to face charges that he helped kill 29,000 jews in the sobibor extermination camp in 1943 .
" john demjanjuk is in strikingly good condition , " said jochen menzel , the deputy director of the stadelheim jail in southern munich .

it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .

bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .

hertha berlin also won to stay a point adrift .
needing a win themselves to go to 61 points and maintain any realistic title dreams , stuttgart got the perfect start , going ahead after 15 minutes when brazilian cafu fired an unstoppable shot into the top corner from the edge of the area . however , schalke were back on level terms six minutes before half time as ivan rakitic curved his free-kick over the wall and past jens lehmann in the stuttgart goal .
but stuttgart were n't to be denied with marica popping up to make it 2-1 on 57 minutes to leave markus babbel 's side unbeaten for eight games . " stuttgart were more effective and deserved to win as a result , " said schalke coach mike bueskens .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support .

australian federal court judge bruce lander sentenced the 65-year-old to three months in prison , saying that " evidence showed a continuing public defiance of the authority of the court . " following his sentencing , toben told reporters that he was ready to go to jail and was willing to do so " for the sake of free expression . " " the world is my prison , where can i run to ? " he said . toben was arrested in britain in october last year , under an arrest warrant issued in germany , where he faces charges of publishing material on the internet " of an anti-semitic and / or revisionist nature " which denies , approves of or , or plays down the holocaust .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany , punishable by up to five years imprisonment . a british court ruled against extraditing him to germany . toben has previously been jailed in both germany and austria for declaring there were no mass killings of jews in world war ii . in 2006 he was a speaker at a controversial conference in tehran organized by the iranian government and attended by president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer recently told the magazine focus that " public opposition to google street view in germany , though not hysterical , had been tougher than in any country . "
fleischer said , however , that specific privacy tools will be developed for the german launch , which google is hoping will happen later this year .
the option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in germany .
google has faced complaints , similar to those in greece , in japan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.05.2009 bayern munich wrap up title in hypothetical table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are the champs at www.wahretabelle.de ever wonder what the bundesliga standings would look like if officials made no mistakes ?
a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .

israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .

although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .
the only hint of the sensitivities were the more than 5,000 police officers , deployed inside the fenced-off area and on surrounding hilltops , to secure the event on the mount of precipice , also known locally as the mount of the leap .

israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .

's ailing opel unit by may 20 .
gm is facing a deadline of june 1 to either restructure or file for bankruptcy .
if gm were to fail , guttenberg said the government would consider fencing off its assets in germany and placing them in a trust .
this would allow more time for negotiations with potential bidders for gm europe , which makes opel and vauxhall cars .
fiat has said it wants to make gm europe part of a global powerhouse , while magna has shown interest in taking a minority stake in opel .
guttenberg said a trust would only take effect if there was a sustainable proposal on the table from at least one potential investor .

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a deficit of at least 45 billion euros is expected in 2009 . the advisors offer an independent forecast every half year of how much revenue federal , state and local government can expect . the data is key to finance market expectations of germany 's borrowing activity .
according to the economic prognosis for this year , the government will have to make do with 527 billion euros - that 's 45 billion euros or 8.5 percent less since the last assessment was completed in november .
most of the unprecedented fallback is being blamed on the sharp downturn in the germany economy .
with a general election looming in september , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats have urged the party leader to promise tax cuts .
but senior officials within the ruling coalition have advised her to resist , arguing that the dip in revenue and a slate of anti-recession spending is likely to put government budgets under heavy strain .
finance minister decries tax cuts in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized talk of tax cuts emanating from the ranks of merkel 's christian democrats .
" promises of tax cuts are quite simply an attempt to deceive the electorate , " he told the paper .
but the head of the opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , guido westerwelle , also had harsh words for steinbrueck in an interview with hamburg 's abendblatt .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.05.2009 bayern munich wrap up title in hypothetical table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are the champs at www.wahretabelle.de ever wonder what the bundesliga standings would look like if officials made no mistakes ?
a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .

for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .

it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .

" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .

the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .

australian federal court judge bruce lander sentenced the 65-year-old to three months in prison , saying that " evidence showed a continuing public defiance of the authority of the court . " following his sentencing , toben told reporters that he was ready to go to jail and was willing to do so " for the sake of free expression . " " the world is my prison , where can i run to ? " he said . toben was arrested in britain in october last year , under an arrest warrant issued in germany , where he faces charges of publishing material on the internet " of an anti-semitic and / or revisionist nature " which denies , approves of or , or plays down the holocaust .
holocaust denial is a crime in germany , punishable by up to five years imprisonment . a british court ruled against extraditing him to germany . toben has previously been jailed in both germany and austria for declaring there were no mass killings of jews in world war ii . in 2006 he was a speaker at a controversial conference in tehran organized by the iranian government and attended by president mahmoud ahmadinejad .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support .
-lrb- 18.09.2008 -rrb- british parliament rejects changes in abortion law attempts by opposition conservatives to tighten britain 's liberal abortion laws were defeated late tuesday , may 20 , when parliament voted to leave the upper time limit for pregnancy termination at 24 weeks .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .

however , the greek data protection agency wants google to also specify how long it intends to keep its images online and what measures the search engine intends to take to inform residents who may be photographed of their rights .
the service , launched in the us two years ago , now covers nine countries , including italy , the netherlands , the united kingdom and spain .
google has said that it wants to expand its service to cover all of europe .
street view provides users a 360-degree view of the urban landscape via an icon on google maps .
users are given the option of zooming in to a given location in google maps and can then drag the icon located above the zoom bar to a given street .
upon zooming , users are given a picture view of the street and a 360-degree view of the area .
germany : tough opposition street view is not yet available for germany .
google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer recently told the magazine focus that " public opposition to google street view in germany , though not hysterical , had been tougher than in any country . "
fleischer said , however , that specific privacy tools will be developed for the german launch , which google is hoping will happen later this year .
the option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in germany .
google has faced complaints , similar to those in greece , in japan .
they led to the company agreeing to re-shoot all images in japan for street view .
google japan announced in a statement wednesday that it would lower cameras , installed on a car roof , after complaints that images were captured over fences and thus violated privacy . nda / ncy / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .

it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 14.05.2009 europe launches telescopes to study universe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the ariane 5 rocket will carry herschel and planck some 1.5 million kilometers from earth the european space agency has launched two powerful new flagship telescopes to study space and time in more detail than in the past and give scientists a better and clearer window on the universe . an ariane 5 rocket carrying the two observatories , herschel and planck , blasted off from the european space agency 's -lrb- esa -rrb- launch centre in french guiana .
it was to take them out to a position some 1.5 million kilometers from earth , giving the astronomical instruments an ideal station from which to view the universe .
the herschel and planck launch comes during the international year of astronomy , a busy year for esa , and is worth around 1.9 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.6 billion -rrb- .
in addition to the two observatories , esa is also set to launch three satellites this year that will acquire key data about ice , gravity and soils on earth .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : esa scored a major success last year when it flew its space freighter , atv to the iss platform for the first time " herschel and planck are part of the new generation of astronomical observations .
we started off close to the earth and we 've gradually moved further away ; but in the future , most observatories will be in deep space , " david southwood , director of science at esa told the bbc last month .
" this allows you to control better the conditions under which the telescopes operate , " he said .
observing the cosmos at far-infrared wavelengths the two telescopes , part of a joint esa program that has taken more than a decade to develop , are on very different cosmic missions .
herschel , the bigger of the two , at 7.5 meters in height , is a far-infrared and sub-millimeter telescope which carries a giant tank of super-fluid helium to cool its instruments .
it 's designed to study how stars and galaxies are formed and how they evolve .
goran pilbratt , project scientist for herschel at the european space agency in noordwijk in the netherlands , told deutsche welle that esa was expecting herschel to provide a fairly clear picture of the origins of the universe .
" how the galaxies were formed , how they evolve over cosmic history , and we will be able to see back in time to perhaps a couple of billion years after the big bang , " pilbratt said .
the advantage of infrared is that it can observe things happening in the universe that are hidden to those who can only see in visible light . experts point out that space is made of clouds of gas and dust so thick that ordinary light ca n't penetrate them .
" we can actually see the emission from this cold cloud itself , and from any bodies that may be inside the cloud that you can not see from the outside because they are emitting through cloud .
so we can see stars forming inside a cloud , " pilbratt said .
probing dark matter the other telescope sharing a ride aboard that ariane 5 rocket , planck , is to study the cosmic microwave background radiation with unprecedented sensitivity and accuracy . sometimes referred to as the " first light " in the universe , the cmb carries information about the earliest structures in the cosmos .
it will also help scientists probe the secrets of dark matter and dark energy .
bildunterschrift : esa has a busy year with the launch of two flagship telescopes and three satellites " dark matter is hypothesized to be a strange kind of substance , it interacts gravitationally with matter and therefore we know it 's there , but we do n't know exactly what it is , " jan tauber , project scientist for planck told deutsche welle .
" dark energy is much more mysterious .
we know very little about it , we only know of its existence since a bit more than 10 years and basically we know that something is pushing out the universe to ever increasing speeds at the current time , but we do n't know what it is . we are looking for clues . ”
herschel is named after sir william herschel , the german-born british astronomer who died in 1822 .
planck is named after max planck , the german scientist who won the nobel prize for physics in 1918 .
he died in 1947 .
there 's no way knowing what the celebrated scientists would have made of the sophisticated machinery bearing their names a million and half kilometers from the earth .
but they might well have applauded the space-borne telescope as a 21st century response to a primeval urge to climb to the top of a hill for a better view of the night sky . sp / ncy , reuters / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .

the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .

the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .

on top of that , non-governmental groups contribute nearly one billion euros yearly to fund development projects worldwide .
many aid groups and experts also fear a slump in germany 's development aid project as a result of the global financial crisis .
the world bank has warned that recession-induced donor fatigue could plunge 90 million more people , mainly in africa , into poverty .
on thursday , the umbrella organization for eu development aid , concord , criticized germany and other member states for inflating their development aid figures .
the group said that last year germany only spent 0.28 percent of gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- on actual aid for the developing world and not 0.38 percent as berlin had claimed .
the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .
concord said only three countries among the eu 's 27 member states – britain , luxembourg and spain – would meet the eu 's goal of pushing countries to raise their aid budget 0.56 percent of gdp . sp / ncy / kna / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .

" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .

the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .

burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .

's ailing opel unit by may 20 .
gm is facing a deadline of june 1 to either restructure or file for bankruptcy .
if gm were to fail , guttenberg said the government would consider fencing off its assets in germany and placing them in a trust .
this would allow more time for negotiations with potential bidders for gm europe , which makes opel and vauxhall cars .
fiat has said it wants to make gm europe part of a global powerhouse , while magna has shown interest in taking a minority stake in opel .
guttenberg said a trust would only take effect if there was a sustainable proposal on the table from at least one potential investor .
transferring the german assets to a trust would mean they could not be seized by creditors .

ukraine 's capital , kyiv , was the country 's only city to be confirmed to co-host the euro 2012 .
it will host group matches , quarterfinal matches and a semifinal .
but uefa warned ukraine that kyiv would be stripped of the final unless significant improvements on the city 's olympic stadium , airport , infrastructure and hotels are made by nov .
30 this year .
three other cities in ukraine – lviv , donetsk and kharkiv – also have until nov .
30 to prove they can make the massive upgrades to roads , airports , stadiums and hotels necessary to host matches .
" we 've clearly set out the conditions ukrainian cities must fulfill before nov .
30 to host euro 2012 , " uefa president michel platini told reporters in bucharest .
" we would like for the executive committee to have an equal division of cities between poland and ukraine .
if ukrainian cities can not fulfill the conditions by november 30 , we will organize euro 2012 with four polish cities and the two best prepared ukrainian cities , " he said .
ukraine reads between the lines ukrainian officials remained upbeat despite uefa 's decision .
preparations for the tournament have been plagued by bureaucracy , legal wrangling and disorganization .

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .

" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .

israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .

lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .
christian protests led all the way up to pope john paul ii .
former prime minister ariel sharon eventually had the mosque 's illegally begun foundations destroyed in 2003 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the greek data protection agency wants google to also specify how long it intends to keep its images online and what measures the search engine intends to take to inform residents who may be photographed of their rights .
the service , launched in the us two years ago , now covers nine countries , including italy , the netherlands , the united kingdom and spain .
google has said that it wants to expand its service to cover all of europe .
street view provides users a 360-degree view of the urban landscape via an icon on google maps .
users are given the option of zooming in to a given location in google maps and can then drag the icon located above the zoom bar to a given street .
upon zooming , users are given a picture view of the street and a 360-degree view of the area .
germany : tough opposition street view is not yet available for germany .
google 's global privacy counsel peter fleischer recently told the magazine focus that " public opposition to google street view in germany , though not hysterical , had been tougher than in any country . "
fleischer said , however , that specific privacy tools will be developed for the german launch , which google is hoping will happen later this year .
the option to have specific images removed would also apply for locations in germany .
google has faced complaints , similar to those in greece , in japan .
they led to the company agreeing to re-shoot all images in japan for street view .
google japan announced in a statement wednesday that it would lower cameras , installed on a car roof , after complaints that images were captured over fences and thus violated privacy . nda / ncy / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.05.2009 german parliament votes to change law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women considering later-term abortions will face stringent consultations german women seeking abortions at a late stage of pregnancy will be required to undergo a consideration period of at least three days before a physician can make a final decision , the parliament has decided . in the bundestag vote on wednesday evening , 326 delegates voted in favor of the consultation period which includes a doctor 's psychological evaluation .
of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de spd mulls supporting new law on late-term abortions germany 's conservative cdu has retracted its planned motion to amend the country 's laws on late-term abortions in order to give its coalition partner , the spd , time to consider adding its support .
-lrb- 18.09.2008 -rrb- british parliament rejects changes in abortion law attempts by opposition conservatives to tighten britain 's liberal abortion laws were defeated late tuesday , may 20 , when parliament voted to leave the upper time limit for pregnancy termination at 24 weeks .

" we would like for the executive committee to have an equal division of cities between poland and ukraine .
if ukrainian cities can not fulfill the conditions by november 30 , we will organize euro 2012 with four polish cities and the two best prepared ukrainian cities , " he said .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9800 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 14.05.2009 as job crisis looms , unions push for new social deal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : job losses are forcing more workers to take to the streets with millions of europeans set to lose their jobs as a result of the worst recession in 60 years , unions are campaigning for a coordinated response at the eu level . according to the european commission 's latest estimates , some 8.5 million europeans will lose their jobs over the next two years , with unemployment hitting 10.9 percent in the euro zone .
as a result , social unrest across the zone could increase as workers meet the crisis with strikes and protests .
some say it 's a potentially explosive situation .
" the unemployment figures are of great concern … we are heading towards a social crisis , " said luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker .
to raise awareness of the issues facing european workers , trade union representatives are holding a series of demonstrations from may 14 - 16 .
up to 200,000 people are expected to take to the streets of madrid , brussels , prague and berlin , said reiner hoffmann , deputy secretary general of the european trade union confederation -lrb- etuc -rrb- , which is sponsoring the " action days . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say the eu is about to be hit by record unemployment " there is a huge opportunity right now for us to forge a new social deal for europe , " hoffmann said , adding that many politicians are committed to avoiding job losses , and that more companies are listening to what trade unions have to say .
however , he also acknowledged that there 's a general sense of frustration that , on the eu level , not enough is being done to protect workers from the effects of the financial crisis .
employment summit a " missed opportunity " this was evidenced by the fact that a recent employment summit in prague , which was meant to bring all eu leaders to the table , was effectively downgraded after many heads of state decided not to attend .
instead , it ended up being a troika summit of the current czech and future swedish and spanish eu presidencies , plus representatives of trade unions and employer groups .
the meeting resulted in a 10-point plan to urge the bloc to increase access to employment and promote mobility , but the social partners at the meeting did n't sign it .
fabian zuleeg , senior policy analyst at the european policy center , said the summit was a missed opportunity for the eu to come to terms with how the bloc 's economic and social models might be challenged by the changes in the labor market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union reps want the eu commission to step up its commitment to workers as an example , he cited the " flexicurity " models that have enjoyed considerable success in scandinavian countries in recent years , thanks to healthy dialogue between unions and employers .
under flexicurity , unions accept a high degree of flexibility for employers as long as there is a strong safety net for workers and active policies to help people get back into jobs should they become unemployed .
" it 's that kind of social contract that will be tested quite strongly now , " zuleeg said .
anti-capitalism on the rise ?
if governments are seen to be dropping the ball on social protection , far-left political organizations could gain ground .
in france , for example , angry workers threatened with lay-offs have taken to trashing company premises and even holding executives hostage in " boss-napping " incidents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in france , there 's a new wave of nationwide strikes by angry workers demanding that french president nicolas sarkozy does more to fight the economic crisis as their actions become more radical , so do their politics , say observers by way of explaining the rise of the new anticapitalist party -lrb- npa -rrb- , which was formed out of several smaller parties in february .
since then , it claims to have tripled its membership under the charismatic leadership of revolutionary postman , olivier besancenot .
and while most european unions would eschew the hard-left tactics embraced by parties such as the npa , they too are benefitting from the crisis . according to the etuc 's hoffmann , the eu member states that had seen a decline in union membership in recent years have managed to stop this trend and are recording greater participation .
there has also been a noticeable increase in public sympathy for unions , he said .
" this has been shown in germany , for example , in public opinion polls and on the whole , public interest in unions has significantly increased , " said hoffmann .
in the meantime , the etuc will continue its campaign for a new social deal for the continent , the backbone of which would be an agreement from the eu to commit 1 percent of its economic output to job creation , research and innovation , and to guarantee stronger workers ' rights , better pay and a " major increase " in government welfare spending .
" the eu needs to take the lead on the macroeconomic level , " said hoffmann .
" we are a single market , we have a joint currency , and that means there should be a proper joint response . "
while there 's no denying that extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , on the whole , experts agree that europe is well-positioned to weather the social impact of the coming unemployment crisis .
" we need to consider how to generate more employment , but we are rightly proud of having a minimum level of social protection in europe , " said the european policy center 's zuleeg .
" we 're not going to give that up even if we have rising unemployment . "

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .

's ailing opel unit by may 20 .
gm is facing a deadline of june 1 to either restructure or file for bankruptcy .
if gm were to fail , guttenberg said the government would consider fencing off its assets in germany and placing them in a trust .
this would allow more time for negotiations with potential bidders for gm europe , which makes opel and vauxhall cars .
fiat has said it wants to make gm europe part of a global powerhouse , while magna has shown interest in taking a minority stake in opel .
guttenberg said a trust would only take effect if there was a sustainable proposal on the table from at least one potential investor .
transferring the german assets to a trust would mean they could not be seized by creditors .
germany has used similar trusts in the past to bring industrial assets under governmental control without actually making them state property . dc / pfd , dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 14.05.2009 german parliament votes to change law on late-term abortions großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women considering later-term abortions will face stringent consultations german women seeking abortions at a late stage of pregnancy will be required to undergo a consideration period of at least three days before a physician can make a final decision , the parliament has decided . in the bundestag vote on wednesday evening , 326 delegates voted in favor of the consultation period which includes a doctor 's psychological evaluation .
of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .
most late-term abortions are carried out when prenatal diagnosis reveals that the fetus has a severe disability . nda / ncy / afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 14.05.2009 bayern munich wrap up title in hypothetical table großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern are the champs at www.wahretabelle.de ever wonder what the bundesliga standings would look like if officials made no mistakes ?
a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

a german website called " the true table " corrects results influenced by refereeing blunders – and has just declared a winner . in the real world , bayern trail wolfsburg in the table with two games to play and head coach juergen klinsmann has been sacked .
but in the parallel universe of www.wahretabelle.de , where the men with the whistles make no mistakes , klinsmann is leaning back in munich celebrating his first title as bayern 's head coach .
the true table website – the brainchild of four passionate football freaks from the northern german city of hamburg – calculates that bayern would have an unassailable lead over stuttgart , if officials had done a better job .
the inspiration for this unique hypothetical exercise came from watching tv .
" controversial scenes and refereeing mistakes are replayed and discussed just as often as goals , " true table head axel seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" they always say things even out in the end , but we wanted to show that that 's not true . "
for the past three seasons , seemann-kahne – a 37-year-old social worker - and three editorial colleagues have corrected results and recalibrated the standings .
the resulting " true " table often differs radically from the real-life bundesliga standings .
the endeavor encourages soccer fans to get in touch with their inner statistical geek , and supporters are increasingly taking up the invitation .
on average , the website attracts thousands of users per day – with up to 30,000 hits after particularly woeful officiating mistakes .
the success comes despite – or perhaps because of – the fact that the participants all know they 're engaged in a very imprecise science .
blind spots bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mistakes and complaints are part of the game in order to qualify as a true blunder , controversial refereeing decisions – penalties not awarded after fouls , for instance , or goals scored from an offside position – must be nominated by community members .
the editors then analyze tv footage , compare match reports and add or subtract goals accordingly .
it 's a process ridden with pitfalls .
the system assumes that all penalties are converted , and it ca n't take into account how early officiating boo-boos often change the complexion of matches over a full 90 minutes .
" obviously it 's a pastime that indicates a general tendency and nothing more , " seemann-kahne said .
" we ca n't really integrate yellow and red cards , for instance , and there 's no way of knowing how the ultimate results might have been affected . "
case in point : bayern 's most recent 3-nil win against leverkusen .
even when their opponents are awarded two goals for early should-have-been penalties , bayern still record a true table win .
but in the real match , had the penalties been given , the odds would have been against a munich victory .
bildunterschrift : the true table , r , presents a very different picture of the league heated debates but what the exercise lacks in precision , it makes up for in passion .
participants in the discussion forum often write about german referees in tones usually reserved for quarrelsome neighbors or off-the-wall acquaintances .
" nothing new for kircher , " grumbled one user after the 32nd round of play , while another opined : " kinhoefer probably thought – that was such an absurd foul , i must have imagined it . "
and the virtual table has attracted the notice of germany 's sports media .
most recently , the country 's leading daily tabloid , bild , ran an article , based on seemann-kahne 's site , claiming that referees were cheating bayern out of the title .
" it happens every season , " the st. pauli fan said .
" in 2007 , it was cottbus , then last year bremen .
but when bayern is involved , things tend to get more heated . "
a thankless task ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league 's whistle-blowers are necessarily amused by the true table according to seemann-kahne , the number of officiating mishaps is up slightly this season compared to the previous two .
but he says that could be down to increased diving and theatrics on the part of the players , and he does n't think referees are ruining the sport .
" for me , officiating mistakes are simply part of the game – just like strikers missing sitters , " seemann-kahne .
and what do referees themselves think of the true table ?
seemann-kahne says as far as he knows they are no first- or second-division officials among the site 's regular users , and attempts to establish contact with the whistle-blowing profession were recently rebuffed .
" we had a referee who said he would talk to us , but than he cancelled the interview , " seemann-kahne told deutsche welle .
" i think he was mad about something we 'd written about him . "
that would be a pity since the true table is less an ongoing tirade against guys doing a very difficult job than a forum for the football-obsessed to reflect on chance and fallibility – and imagine what might have been .
the website may have been founded with the aim of proving that everything does not even out in the end .
but it also shows that to err is human and to forgive … well , there 's always next season .

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.05.2009 climate change to displace 30 million in bangladesh großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates from around the world are debating the links between oceans and climate change at manado in indonesia this week experts warn that the sea level will rise by about a metre over the coming decades .
the consequences are going to be dramatic for many countries , but especially for bangladesh .
the united nations international panel on climate change estimates that by the year 2050 nearly one fifth of the country will be submerged by water .
more than 30 million people will lose their livelihoods .
they will be forced to migrate to the north or to neighbouring countries . as the sea level rises , the flat south asian country of bangladesh is going to suffer disproportionately from increasingly frequent and strong storms , floods and drought .
mahaboob hasan from the bangladesh unnayan parishad environmental research institute in the capital dhaka says : " there will be intrusion of saline water due to the rise of sea level .
the entire agricultural ecosystem will be jeopardized .
rice is not tolerant to excess saline water .
that will really affect the food security of the people living in the coastal zone . "
wave of migrants expected when the rice and vegetable cultivations disappear under water , most small farmers and agricultural labourers will lose their main source of income .
experts predict that some 30 or 40 million people will start out for other parts of bangladesh .
this huge number of migrants will cause a humanitarian catastrophe in the already overpopulated country , says thomas hirsch from the german bread for the world development aid organisation .
" in a country like bangladesh which is extremely poor , climate refugees will end up living in miserable conditions in the big cities " , hirsch says .
" there will be hardly enough jobs to allow people to live decently .
very often , whole families , including children will have to work in dismal conditions only to survive . "
bangladesh has started looking for ways to tackle these ecological and social challenges along with international development organisations .
the common aim is to develop adaptation strategies that are locally acceptable .
thomas hirsch from bread for the world cites some of the issues locals have to deal with : " how can i prepare myself ?
by diversifying crops or using saline-resistant rice-species for example .
which other new sources of income may be possible if agriculture ceases to provide employment ?
what will i have to do if my only chance is migration ?
we are trying to find different ways out and to introduce long term sustainable strategies . "
the government of bangladesh has started afforestation projects in the country ’ s coastal areas .
elsewhere , dams are being built to stop saline water from coming in .
stone houses on stilts have been made to give people shelter in case of floods .
' exporting ' people but adaptation is not always the right choice , says climate expert mahaboob hasan .
he insists that people also have to be ready to seek a new life somewhere else .
" we are training the people so that they can go abroad " , hasan explains .
" labour is cheap in bangladesh and there is big demand in the middle east countries .
so we are just about to start action for short training and ' exporting ' them to the different countries . "
the tide of climate migrants will not stop within the borders of bangladesh .
therefore , experts are calling for more cooperation between neighbouring countries .
the responsibilities of the industrialised countries that are blamed for causing climate change remain an open question .

the consequences are going to be dramatic for many countries , but especially for bangladesh .
the united nations international panel on climate change estimates that by the year 2050 nearly one fifth of the country will be submerged by water .
more than 30 million people will lose their livelihoods .
they will be forced to migrate to the north or to neighbouring countries . as the sea level rises , the flat south asian country of bangladesh is going to suffer disproportionately from increasingly frequent and strong storms , floods and drought .
mahaboob hasan from the bangladesh unnayan parishad environmental research institute in the capital dhaka says : " there will be intrusion of saline water due to the rise of sea level .
the entire agricultural ecosystem will be jeopardized .
rice is not tolerant to excess saline water .
that will really affect the food security of the people living in the coastal zone . "
wave of migrants expected when the rice and vegetable cultivations disappear under water , most small farmers and agricultural labourers will lose their main source of income .
experts predict that some 30 or 40 million people will start out for other parts of bangladesh .
this huge number of migrants will cause a humanitarian catastrophe in the already overpopulated country , says thomas hirsch from the german bread for the world development aid organisation .
" in a country like bangladesh which is extremely poor , climate refugees will end up living in miserable conditions in the big cities " , hirsch says .
" there will be hardly enough jobs to allow people to live decently .
very often , whole families , including children will have to work in dismal conditions only to survive . "
bangladesh has started looking for ways to tackle these ecological and social challenges along with international development organisations .
the common aim is to develop adaptation strategies that are locally acceptable .
thomas hirsch from bread for the world cites some of the issues locals have to deal with : " how can i prepare myself ?
by diversifying crops or using saline-resistant rice-species for example .
which other new sources of income may be possible if agriculture ceases to provide employment ?
what will i have to do if my only chance is migration ?
we are trying to find different ways out and to introduce long term sustainable strategies . "
the government of bangladesh has started afforestation projects in the country ’ s coastal areas .
elsewhere , dams are being built to stop saline water from coming in .
stone houses on stilts have been made to give people shelter in case of floods .
' exporting ' people but adaptation is not always the right choice , says climate expert mahaboob hasan .
he insists that people also have to be ready to seek a new life somewhere else .
" we are training the people so that they can go abroad " , hasan explains .
" labour is cheap in bangladesh and there is big demand in the middle east countries .
so we are just about to start action for short training and ' exporting ' them to the different countries . "
the tide of climate migrants will not stop within the borders of bangladesh .
therefore , experts are calling for more cooperation between neighbouring countries .
the responsibilities of the industrialised countries that are blamed for causing climate change remain an open question .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 14.05.2009 german researchers deplore trend toward arms build-up großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bicc is dedicated to promoting peace and development german peace researchers say germany has not only steadily increased its defense budget over the past three years – it is also one of the world 's leading arms exporters . the bonn international center for conversion -lrb- bicc -rrb- , one of germany 's leading peace and conflict research institutes , on thursday welcomed the new disarmament initiatives in the nuclear field , especially us president obama 's vision of a world without nuclear weapons .
but the german peace researchers warned that conventional military spending continues unabated – in 2007 , it amounted to a total of 1,339 trillion dollars .
speaking at the presentation of the institute 's annual report , president peter croll said that this amounted to an increase of 45 percent since 1998 – and the us is at the top of the list : “ the united states ' military expenditure is unparalleled internationally .
the figures in this area show no “ change ” in us policy , quite the opposite ” , croll reported .
with almost 580 billion dollars , the united states accounts for almost half of total worldwide military spending , the german institute says , and adds that the pentagon 's approved base budget this year is the highest since the end of world war ii .
according to the german study , the us is closely followed by china , russia , india and the united kingdom . the bicc is an independent , non-profit organization bicc is dedicated to promoting and facilitating peace and development .
germany : more military spending than ever before germany 's defense budget and arms exports have also reached a record high .
berlin 's defense budget , says marc von boemcken bicc project leader in the field of arms data , has increased steadily since 2006 , and now amounts to about 31,2 billion euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter croll says the ratio between investments in arms and investments in development is nine to one “ a large part of the military budget , about 5.3 billion euros , is intended for the purchase of new weapons systems , ” von boemcken says , “ investments to buy new weapons have risen by 25 percent since 2007 . ”
the project leader added that the budget is likely to expand further : following parliament 's approval of plans for more german troops in afghanistan , the cost of military missions abroad is expected to increase .
germany : one of the world 's top arms exporters .
according to the government 's latest arms export report , the total value of approved licenses for german arms exports amounted to 8.7 billion euros in 2007 - an increase of one billion euros over 2006 . at thursday 's presentation , marc von boemcken criticzed that an increasing number of weapons are exported to countries that do not fulfill at least four of the eu 's criteria for arms exports .
von boemcken emphasized that the “ most problematical recipient countries ” include in particular oman , egypt and angola .
he also referred to alarming supplies of arms to pakistan .
finally , the bicc researchers expressed alarm at a widening divide between military expenditure and spending on development cooperation .
in 2007 , they say , the 30 member states of the organization for economic co-operation and development , the oecd , spent about 920 billion dollars on defense – but only about 100 billion dollars on development aid . for the first time , bicc presented a global militarization index -lrb- gmi -rrb- that deals with the significance of a state ’ s military sector in relation to society as a whole .
marc von boemcken says that a high gmi rating can indicate serious deficiencies in government.eritrea , for instance , is by the standards of all the criteria is the most militarized country in the world , since it spends more than 20 percent of its gdp on its armed forces compared with a mere 3.7 percent on public health . db / pfd , dpa / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sadly , nazareth has experienced tensions in recent years , which have harmed relations between its christian and muslim communities , " the pope told tens of thousands of pilgrims gathered for an open-air mass on thursday at an amphitheater just outside of the city known as jesus ' hometown .
these tensions were temporarily swept aside , however , as foreign pilgrims and local arab christians gathered on the hillside as early as dawn , hours before the biggest religious event of the pontiff 's eight-day tour of the holy land .
the mass , attended by more than 50,000 people was celebrated in arabic , english and latin .
if wednesday 's visit to the west bank city of bethlehem was the highlight of benedict 's pilgrimage for the 1.9-percent christian minority in the palestinian territories , thursday 's visit to nazareth was the highlight for israel 's 2.1-percent christian-arab minority .

israel , solely responsible for the pope 's safety , was not taking any risks , explained police spokesman mickey rosenfeld .
" we know that there have been statements made against the pope , so we are prepared , " he said .
lingering anger from 2006 remarks some of nazareth 's muslim residents had objected to the papal visit , angry over his controversial 2006 remarks during a lecture at the university of regensburg , germany , in which he quoted a byzantine emperor making statements against the prophet muhammad .
although christians were once the majority , at least 70 percent of the town 's population is now muslim .
tensions between its muslim majority and declining christian minority reached a peak in 1999 , when then prime minister benjamin netanyahu - who now leads israel once again following elections earlier this year - approved construction of a mosque near the church of the nativity , built on the site where christians believe the angel gabriel announced to mary she would give birth to the son of god .

of the 612 parliamentarians involved in the vote , 234 voted against and 52 abstained .
parliamentarians also voted in favor of increased consultations and support for families with handicapped children considering a termination .
currently , some 600 late-term abortions are performed in germany each year .
the motion aims to reduce this number by mandating that women receive counseling from a doctor about the medical and psychological consequences of a late-term abortion .
the doctor should also inform the patient about living with a physically or mentally disabled child , and point her towards other means of support .
a woman considering a late-term abortion would also have a three-day waiting period between the counseling session and the procedure to give her time to think about her options .
the new law also sets a 10,000-euro -lrb- $ 14,400 -rrb- fine for doctors who fail to properly advise patients .
after being approved by the upper chamber of parliament , the bundesrat , it should come into effect in january 2010 .
in a separate vote on whether the state should increase the depth of its data collection on late abortions , a majority of delegates rejected the plan .
social democrats still divided over bill bildunterschrift : the bundestag debate failed to get full cross-party approval despite the bill being passed the intense two-hour debate in the bundestag caused splits within the political parties , particularly in the social democrats ' -lrb- spd -rrb- group , where the final decision was still disputed at the end of the session . some spd members were pushing for a more flexible time of consultation based on a case-by-case policy .
the conservative parties , the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- and its bavarian sister party the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , were united on the bill .
despite several past attempts , the spd and cdu , germany 's two coalition partners , have never managed to find a common position on late-term abortions .
a late-term abortion is a termination which is carried out after the 20th week in a pregnancy when there is a risk to the physical or mental health of the mother .

a new study published this week says the country 's aid policy is hobbled by a lack of transparency and reliable methods to assess whether funds really reach the world 's needy . the study , commissioned by the german development ministry , and published in berlin this week said the country urgently needed a common and independent evaluation method for its various aid programs scattered across several ministries and sectors .
" the heterogeneity of the existing evaluation systems is reflected in the strong fragmentation of german development aid cooperation , " reinhard stockmann from the center for evaluation at the university of saarland , one of two research institutions that conducted the study , said .
" a common evaluation instrument is urgently needed , " he said .
lessons from abroad the study surveyed 19 state-run , church-owned and non-governmental organizations .
stockmann also said the system was marked by a lack of transparency in the way funds are spent on development projects .
he pointed out that the german ministry for economic cooperation and development was the only institution to publish its aid evaluation report online .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts say germany 's development aid policy needs to be better coordinated stockmann added that germany could learn some lessons from other countries in assessing aid projects .

in britain there 's an advisory panel , which tells government which methods and even which programs and projects should be evaluated . "
eu slams germany for inflating aid figures germany 's aid budget this year amounts to about 5.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 7.85 billion -rrb- .
on top of that , non-governmental groups contribute nearly one billion euros yearly to fund development projects worldwide .
many aid groups and experts also fear a slump in germany 's development aid project as a result of the global financial crisis .
the world bank has warned that recession-induced donor fatigue could plunge 90 million more people , mainly in africa , into poverty .
on thursday , the umbrella organization for eu development aid , concord , criticized germany and other member states for inflating their development aid figures .
the group said that last year germany only spent 0.28 percent of gdp -lrb- gross domestic product -rrb- on actual aid for the developing world and not 0.38 percent as berlin had claimed .
the rest was spent on debt cancellation , funds for foreign students and refugees , the group said .
concord said only three countries among the eu 's 27 member states – britain , luxembourg and spain – would meet the eu 's goal of pushing countries to raise their aid budget 0.56 percent of gdp . sp / ncy / kna / epd send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yettaw was detained last week for sneaking into her off-limits house and staying there for two days before he was caught .
the american swam across a lake to gain access to the house .
he was also charged with violating the security law and immigration conditions , according to one of her lawyers , hla myo myint .
" the authorities have charged aung san suu kyi and her two maids , " hla myo myint told reporters outside the prison .
a spokesman for opposition national league for democracy -lrb- nld -rrb- party , which suu kyi leads , said she had been charged under burma 's law safeguarding the state from the dangers of subversive elements , which carries a three-to-five-year jail term if a detainee " violates the restrictions imposed on them . "
the trial was scheduled to begin on monday , suu kyi 's attorney kyi win said .
there is " no justification " for the new charges brought against suu kyi , the european union 's special envoy to burma , piero fassino said .
he also told italy 's channel 5 television , that there is no justification for the decision to charge her with breaching the terms of her house arrest and put her on trial next monday .
fassino said the international community should use " every possible means to press for the release of aung san suu kyi " as well as " the 2,000 other political prisoners who are held in burmese jails . "
germany " deeply concerned " in berlin , the german foreign ministry issued a statement saying it was " very deeply concerned about her situation and health . "
foreign ministry spokesman , jens ploetner , said the burmese government should drop the charges and end her house arrest .
the foreign ministry added that a " permanent reconciliation and stability in burma " could only be achieved by allowing all political and ethnic groups to enter the political process .
europe calls for international efforts to pressure burma bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu called for the release of all political prisoners the italian envoy said that europe should work with the united states and asian countries to " make the burmese junta understand that its oppressive and dictatorial policy is unacceptable for the international community . "
suu kyi , known to be in poor health , has been kept in near-isolation for the past six years with only weekly visits by her doctors allowed , as well as occasional visits by united nations special envoys .
in a separate statement , the eu voiced concern over suu kyi 's health and urged the junta to allow " immediate and proper health care " for the ailing pro-democracy figure .
" the european union expresses its strong concern following reports on the health of daw aung san suu kyi , " the czech eu presidency said in a statement on behalf of the 27 eu member states , also renewing the call for her unconditional release from house arrest .
" the eu calls on the authorities of burma / myanmar to guarantee for ms suu kyi immediate and proper medical care , as well as access for her personal attorney , " the statement added .
in burma , the nld immediately criticized the decision to send suu kyi to trial .
" daw aung san suu kyi , who was nearly due to finish her house arrest term , has been placed in a bungalow house in insein prison ... although she has not admitted to any crime , " the nld said in a statement .
suu kyi 's current sentence is due to expire on may 27 .
us citizen blamed for situation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yettaw swam to suu kyi 's house and refused to leave suu kyi 's main lawyer kyi win pinned the blame on john yettaw - whom authorities in rangoon have described as a 53-year-old vietnam war veteran - saying that aung san suu kyi had asked him to leave her house .
" we have to blame him , " kyi win said .
" he is a fool . "
it was apparently the second time that yettaw had tried to meet suu kyi at her home .
kyi win said yettaw was told to leave after attempting to meet her in 2008 .
this time yettaw refused .
" he said he was so tired and wanted to rest , but she pleaded with him .
then he slept overnight on the ground floor , " kyi win told the democratic voice of burma -lrb- dvb -rrb- .
yettaw met us embassy officials on wednesday but they have revealed little about his motives .
" we can not comment .
he did n't tell us any details , " embassy spokesman richard mei said .
burma 's ruling military junta has scheduled a general election next year , and it is deemed unlikely that it would want suu kyi to be free during the polls .
her party won the 1990 polls by a landslide but has been denied power by the military for the past 19 years . " the regime filed these charges to extend her detention beyond the six years , " said aung din , the executive director of the us campaign for burma , a pro-democracy group .
" it is an act of blackmailing the international community , especially the united states , demanding a ransom to get back an american citizen and better treatment for daw aung san suu kyi , " he said . nda , nrt afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a deficit of at least 45 billion euros is expected in 2009 . the advisors offer an independent forecast every half year of how much revenue federal , state and local government can expect . the data is key to finance market expectations of germany 's borrowing activity .
according to the economic prognosis for this year , the government will have to make do with 527 billion euros - that 's 45 billion euros or 8.5 percent less since the last assessment was completed in november .
most of the unprecedented fallback is being blamed on the sharp downturn in the germany economy .
with a general election looming in september , chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats have urged the party leader to promise tax cuts .
but senior officials within the ruling coalition have advised her to resist , arguing that the dip in revenue and a slate of anti-recession spending is likely to put government budgets under heavy strain .
finance minister decries tax cuts in an interview with the passauer neue presse newspaper , finance minister peer steinbrueck -lrb- spd -rrb- criticized talk of tax cuts emanating from the ranks of merkel 's christian democrats .
" promises of tax cuts are quite simply an attempt to deceive the electorate , " he told the paper .
but the head of the opposition liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , guido westerwelle , also had harsh words for steinbrueck in an interview with hamburg 's abendblatt .

the ruling labour party suspended a senior politician , and a top aide to the head of the opposition stepped down . prime minister gordon brown took action in the growing expenses scandal by suspending former minister elliot morley after he was found to have claimed expenses on a mortgage on a second home that had long been paid off .
the amount in question - 16,000 pounds -lrb- 17,800 euros -rrb- - has been repaid by morley , who also lost his job as the international climate change envoy for the government .
conservative legislator andrew mackay resigned as a senior advisor to opposition leader david cameron after a review of his expenses revealed an " unacceptable situation , " a spokesman for cameron said .
" the highest standards have got to be upheld in public life , " brown told reporters .
morley and mackay are the first politicians to be disciplined in the expenses row , which some say is alienating british voters ahead of the june 4 local elections .
according to analysts , brown has the most to lose , as polls indicate his labour party is losing ground to the conservatives .
brown warned that more heads could roll if further transgressions are discovered .
" where disciplinary action is necessary it will , and will immediately , be taken , " he told reporters .
" if there are any other disciplinary cases where we have to take action , we will take action immediately . "
both morley and mackay , however , remain members of parliament until the next general election , which must be held by the middle of 2010 . dc / pfd , dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the research organisation says lessons are not being learned from the deaths on britain 's roads .
it wants road accident investigators to find out why collisions have happened rather than who was to blame .
around 45 people a year are killed in air , train or marine accidents , but in 2008 more than 2,900 died on the roads .
when there is an air crash , train crash , or tragedy at sea , specialist investigators are called in to find the causes .
' huge variation ' traffic collision investigations are currently the job of the police , but they gather evidence to bring convictions , not to explain events .
the rac foundation 's report makes no criticism of the police service .
its author , dr chris elliot , says someone should be taking a wider look at the causes - both direct and contributory . "
we have to challenge the global trend towards criminalising accidents and their investigation " dr chris elliot " in 1972 the groundbreaking robens report revolutionised workplace safety and led to the creation of a coherent and rational legal structure that has saved hundreds of lives , " he said .
" it is time to have a similar root and branch review of the way transport safety policy is implemented and co-ordinated .
" we have to challenge the global trend towards criminalising accidents and their investigation . "
a road accident investigation body would not seek to blame but could lead to improvements in policy , road or vehicle design and even traffic management .
dr elliot 's report highlights an accident on the m6 in october 2008 in which six family members were killed when a truck ran into their stationary car .
police found the cause to be a lapse of concentration by the truck driver who was charged with causing death by careless driving and sentenced to three years in prison .
dr elliot has questioned whether his lapse was the root cause of the accident .
" motorways are very safe when traffic is flowing smoothly , " he said .
but when the traffic flow is disrupted , a single lapse could lead to tragedy , he added .
" it is arguable that the root cause of the accident was an earlier accident on the same section of motorway that caused the traffic jam in which the car was stopped , " he said .
" it is not clear whether this could have been cleared more quickly if , for example , there had been no pressure to investigate possible criminal offences . "
the report says the level of investigation varies hugely between different types of transport .
the 2007 grayrigg rail crash in cumbria , in which one person died , resulted in an 18-month inquiry , a 250-page report , and 29 safety recommendations .
officer numbers down but when a bus crashed in august 2008 near alton towers in staffordshire , also killing one person , there was no investigation into the root causes .
that was the case despite locals criticising what they called inadequate roads and sharp corners .
it is possible the police could carry out this type of evidence-gathering and analysis , but the number of traffic police officers has fallen .
the sheer regularity of road deaths means there would be far more work to do than for air , sea or rail crashes .
the government does not support the idea .
it believes wider research into road safety is the best way to learn lessons .

the research organisation says lessons are not being learned from the deaths on britain 's roads .
it wants road accident investigators to find out why collisions have happened rather than who was to blame .
around 45 people a year are killed in air , train or marine accidents , but in 2008 more than 2,900 died on the roads .
when there is an air crash , train crash , or tragedy at sea , specialist investigators are called in to find the causes .
' huge variation ' traffic collision investigations are currently the job of the police , but they gather evidence to bring convictions , not to explain events .
the rac foundation 's report makes no criticism of the police service .
its author , dr chris elliot , says someone should be taking a wider look at the causes - both direct and contributory .
we have to challenge the global trend towards criminalising accidents and their investigation dr chris elliot " in 1972 the groundbreaking robens report revolutionised workplace safety and led to the creation of a coherent and rational legal structure that has saved hundreds of lives , " he said .
" it is time to have a similar root and branch review of the way transport safety policy is implemented and co-ordinated .
" we have to challenge the global trend towards criminalising accidents and their investigation . "
a road accident investigation body would not seek to blame but could lead to improvements in policy , road or vehicle design and even traffic management .
dr elliot 's report highlights an accident on the m6 in october 2008 in which six family members were killed when a truck ran into their stationary car .
police found the cause to be a lapse of concentration by the truck driver who was charged with causing death by careless driving and sentenced to three years in prison .
an 18-month inquiry followed the 2007 grayrigg rail crash in cumbria dr elliot has questioned whether his lapse was the root cause of the accident .
" motorways are very safe when traffic is flowing smoothly , " he said .
but when the traffic flow is disrupted , a single lapse could lead to tragedy , he added .
" it is arguable that the root cause of the accident was an earlier accident on the same section of motorway that caused the traffic jam in which the car was stopped , " he said .
" it is not clear whether this could have been cleared more quickly if , for example , there had been no pressure to investigate possible criminal offences . "
the report says the level of investigation varies hugely between different types of transport .
the 2007 grayrigg rail crash in cumbria , in which one person died , resulted in an 18-month inquiry , a 250-page report , and 29 safety recommendations .
officer numbers down but when a bus crashed in august 2008 near alton towers in staffordshire , also killing one person , there was no investigation into the root causes .
that was the case despite locals criticising what they called inadequate roads and sharp corners .
it is possible the police could carry out this type of evidence-gathering and analysis , but the number of traffic police officers has fallen .
the sheer regularity of road deaths means there would be far more work to do than for air , sea or rail crashes .
the government does not support the idea .
it believes wider research into road safety is the best way to learn lessons .

" it is time to have a similar root and branch review of the way transport safety policy is implemented and co-ordinated .
" we have to challenge the global trend towards criminalising accidents and their investigation . "
a road accident investigation body would not seek to blame but could lead to improvements in policy , road or vehicle design and even traffic management .
dr elliot 's report highlights an accident on the m6 in october 2008 in which six family members were killed when a truck ran into their stationary car .
police found the cause to be a lapse of concentration by the truck driver who was charged with causing death by careless driving and sentenced to three years in prison .
an 18-month inquiry followed the 2007 grayrigg rail crash in cumbria dr elliot has questioned whether his lapse was the root cause of the accident .
" motorways are very safe when traffic is flowing smoothly , " he said .
but when the traffic flow is disrupted , a single lapse could lead to tragedy , he added .
" it is arguable that the root cause of the accident was an earlier accident on the same section of motorway that caused the traffic jam in which the car was stopped , " he said .
" it is not clear whether this could have been cleared more quickly if , for example , there had been no pressure to investigate possible criminal offences . "
the report says the level of investigation varies hugely between different types of transport .
the 2007 grayrigg rail crash in cumbria , in which one person died , resulted in an 18-month inquiry , a 250-page report , and 29 safety recommendations .
officer numbers down but when a bus crashed in august 2008 near alton towers in staffordshire , also killing one person , there was no investigation into the root causes .
that was the case despite locals criticising what they called inadequate roads and sharp corners .
it is possible the police could carry out this type of evidence-gathering and analysis , but the number of traffic police officers has fallen .
the sheer regularity of road deaths means there would be far more work to do than for air , sea or rail crashes .
the government does not support the idea .
it believes wider research into road safety is the best way to learn lessons .

the ams said they want the assembly government to outline how it will use economic levers at its disposal to underpin a post-recession economy .
they said the education and skills department in particular has not reacted as effectively as possible .
an independent review of how the governments worked across policy areas is being urged .
however , the assembly 's enterprise and learning committee praised the administration 's handling of the downturn so far .
they have produced a list of 16 recommendations designed to help the assembly government improve their response .
committee chair , gareth jones , said : " we found the welsh government 's response to the current economic downturn has done much that is to be commended over recent months .
pro-act scheme " the committee believes , however , that the cross-cutting link between employment and skills , between education and economic development , between knowledge and wealth creation needs to be strengthened if wales is to have a vibrant future . "
in particular , the ams backed the five economic summits the assembly government has organised in response to the crisis .
they said the summits were " an innovative and effective way of garnering support and stimulating ideas " .
the committee members also praised the " rapid introduction " of the £ 68m pro-act scheme which they said will help more than 12,000 employers .
but they added some evidence suggested businesses were already finding the scheme 's application process was " bureaucratic " and that " too few companies were benefiting from it . "
cross-portfolio working also in their list of recommendations , the ams say they believe the assembly government should following the scottish executive 's example and provide more business rate relief , which could help businesses throughout wales .
they say the administration should restart work on its manufacturing strategy with a view to begin implementing it in the second half of 2009 .
they also say it should invite an independent review of its cross-portfolio working across all areas of government , but with particular reference to the performance of the departments for economy and transport and children , education , lifelong learning and skills .
the assembly committee also says in its recommendations that it is important to remember that the private sector will be a key partner in the procurement of services under the convergence funding projects .
it emphasised the importance of ministers using european funds for sustainable projects " and to underpin a strategic vision rather than short-term emergency support " .
it also recommended the assembly government consider a more comprehensive role for finance wales to enable it to provide more routine credit to businesses .
