program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2009 bundeswehr faces uphill battle against taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts says the bundeswehr will struggle to keep the taliban from returning german military and afghan forces are midway through a joint offensive to push the taliban from the northern province of kunduz .
but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient .

he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .

the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .

but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .

the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 28.07.2009 report : suspicious substances found in tour de france trashcans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no positive tests so far from this year 's tour , but not everyone 's convinced the race was clean the french anti-doping chief has told " le monde " that substances possibly used for doping were found in the trashcans of some tour de france teams .
he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

"
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .

rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .

" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .

the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2009 bundeswehr faces uphill battle against taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts says the bundeswehr will struggle to keep the taliban from returning german military and afghan forces are midway through a joint offensive to push the taliban from the northern province of kunduz .
but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .
so the fresh money is only the first step .
hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .
the hamburg-based shipping company employs around 8.000 people. ai / reuters / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : art off the beaten path part four : for cologne gallery , it 's art over business part one : berlin gallery scores with stereotypes part three : hamburg gallery encourages loitering bus tours uncover paris ' contemporary art scene art -pipe- 28.07.2009 volunteers bring promising young artists to leipzig großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : d21 wanted to be an alternative to artists like neo rauch -lrb- pictured : " sekte 2004 " -rrb- and the new leipzig school germany is littered with small , independent galleries and art rooms .
distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . a stroll through the lindenau district of leipzig is a must for any art lover in town - not least because it is home to the art movement known as the new leipzig school , which is centered around ateliers located in an old cotton mill . there , neo rauch and his contemporaries employ a unique blend of socialist realism to create distinctive and thought-provoking works of art . the d21 gallery - located just a short distance form the mill - embodies typical german suburbia , on the other hand .
there is a theater across the street , but in general the neighboring businesses reflect the necessities and habits of modern life : a pharmacist , two bakeries , and a pet shop . " we consciously moved here three years ago , " said curator michael moser , 35 . " in this underdeveloped area there is the possibility of creating something new . we want to build a counterbalance to the hype surrounding the leipzig school and sought to create a gallery in this non-commercial district . " the formula has proven to be a success . slowly but surely the district of lindenau has been developing . whoever takes the trouble to explore the neighboring side-streets will stumble across half a dozen other small galleries which owe their existence to d21 . bildunterschrift : michael moser , 35 , is a volunteer curator d21 relies on volunteers the 85-square-meter -lrb- 915-square-foot -rrb- gallery derives its name from its address , demmringstrasse 21 - a location steeped in local history . " this used to be a hair salon , but that is going back a long way , " said 24-year-old gallery volunteer regine ehleiter . going even further back , the building was once a guardhouse dating from the industrial revolution . after renting the space , moser and his team spent the first few months preparing the building , plastering the walls , and tearing out the old ceiling . " that was a really tough job , and that 's why we do n't pay rent , just 300 euros -lrb- $ 427 -rrb- a month for electricity , water , and any other costs that come up , " moser and ehleiter said .
if the price was any higher , the project would be jeopardized . the non-profit group of artists responsible for financing the gallery consists of 30 members , including seven dedicated curators .
some of them support the project financially by paying a 30-euro membership fee , while others choose to donate their time . " we need both kinds of people , " said moser . bildunterschrift : the gallery organizes thematic exhibitions and seeks up-and-coming artists from around the world funding is crucial moser is a photographer and ehleiter an art student .
most of the other members are also students . those able to spare time and lend a hand are asked to watch over the exhibition room , advertise the gallery by word of mouth , and help out with the general upkeep . the group aims for five to six exhibitions a year , but that is dependent on the financial grants it received from the city of leipzig , and from the regional and federal governments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

but managers in frankfurt are n't ready to celebrate just yet . deutsche bank ag reported a better-than-expected 68-percent surge in second-quarter profits on tuesday , powered by a strong recovery in global capital markets . the frankfurt-based bank , germany 's largest , said net profit jumped to 1.09 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- in the fourth , fifth , and sixth months of the year , up from 649 million euros in the same period in 2008 . the figure was better than the average 985 million euros forecast by economists in a thomson-reuters poll . the german lender was buoyed by the resumption of trading after global monetary and financial authorities injected hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the world financial system , trying to end the freeze in credit markets . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said upon releasing the results that he was hopeful that the global financial industry was emerging from the crisis that began to take hold in late 2007 .
the bank posted it first annual loss in half a century last year in the wake of the worldwide financial meltdown .

" we have cut costs , reduced balance-sheet risk , and reinforced our liquidity and capital position , " he said . responding to concerns that germany may face a domestic credit crunch in the second half of 2009 , ackermann said deutsche bank was willing to extend credit to help the economy recover . " we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . a stroll through the lindenau district of leipzig is a must for any art lover in town - not least because it is home to the art movement known as the new leipzig school , which is centered around ateliers located in an old cotton mill . there , neo rauch and his contemporaries employ a unique blend of socialist realism to create distinctive and thought-provoking works of art . the d21 gallery - located just a short distance form the mill - embodies typical german suburbia , on the other hand .
there is a theater across the street , but in general the neighboring businesses reflect the necessities and habits of modern life : a pharmacist , two bakeries , and a pet shop . " we consciously moved here three years ago , " said curator michael moser , 35 . " in this underdeveloped area there is the possibility of creating something new . we want to build a counterbalance to the hype surrounding the leipzig school and sought to create a gallery in this non-commercial district . " the formula has proven to be a success . slowly but surely the district of lindenau has been developing . whoever takes the trouble to explore the neighboring side-streets will stumble across half a dozen other small galleries which owe their existence to d21 . bildunterschrift : michael moser , 35 , is a volunteer curator d21 relies on volunteers the 85-square-meter -lrb- 915-square-foot -rrb- gallery derives its name from its address , demmringstrasse 21 - a location steeped in local history . " this used to be a hair salon , but that is going back a long way , " said 24-year-old gallery volunteer regine ehleiter . going even further back , the building was once a guardhouse dating from the industrial revolution . after renting the space , moser and his team spent the first few months preparing the building , plastering the walls , and tearing out the old ceiling . " that was a really tough job , and that 's why we do n't pay rent , just 300 euros -lrb- $ 427 -rrb- a month for electricity , water , and any other costs that come up , " moser and ehleiter said .
if the price was any higher , the project would be jeopardized . the non-profit group of artists responsible for financing the gallery consists of 30 members , including seven dedicated curators .
some of them support the project financially by paying a 30-euro membership fee , while others choose to donate their time . " we need both kinds of people , " said moser . bildunterschrift : the gallery organizes thematic exhibitions and seeks up-and-coming artists from around the world funding is crucial moser is a photographer and ehleiter an art student .
most of the other members are also students . those able to spare time and lend a hand are asked to watch over the exhibition room , advertise the gallery by word of mouth , and help out with the general upkeep . the group aims for five to six exhibitions a year , but that is dependent on the financial grants it received from the city of leipzig , and from the regional and federal governments .
michael moser considers the grants " recognition of our work and as a sign that we are doing a good job here . " since the members of the association work on a voluntary basis , all of the grant money can be pumped into financing the exhibitions . organizing a single show can cost up to several thousand euros , including expenses for travel and transport of the artwork , redecorating the gallery space , printing flyers and royalties for the participating artists . windows open doors to art the gallery members do n't display their own works in the exhibition space , but look for promising , young artists from around the world who would not otherwise have a presence in leipzig . exhibitions of individual artists are a rarity , as d21 prefers to organize thematic shows that highlight works by several up-and-coming artists . " we want to display art that would otherwise not receive a platform , " explained regine ehleiter .
" we have also sold paintings , but nothing worth mentioning . " passing trade is practically non-existent as " most residents in the area do not dare enter , even when the door is left wide open , " said ehleiter .
" to change this , we take advantage of the building 's large windows and try to draw people in to create a customer base . the windows are a tool that can be used to communicate with the public . " there is no intention of ever letting d21 become a commercial gallery , even in the distant future . for ehleiter , the gallery is not about turning a profit : her reward is measured in a different currency . " i profit by simply working here .
no seminar in cultural management would be able to teach me what i have learned in the previous three years working here .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .
so the fresh money is only the first step .
hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .
the hamburg-based shipping company employs around 8.000 people. ai / reuters / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . a stroll through the lindenau district of leipzig is a must for any art lover in town - not least because it is home to the art movement known as the new leipzig school , which is centered around ateliers located in an old cotton mill . there , neo rauch and his contemporaries employ a unique blend of socialist realism to create distinctive and thought-provoking works of art . the d21 gallery - located just a short distance form the mill - embodies typical german suburbia , on the other hand .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .

tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .

hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .

" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .
so the fresh money is only the first step .
hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .

" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2009 bundeswehr faces uphill battle against taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts says the bundeswehr will struggle to keep the taliban from returning german military and afghan forces are midway through a joint offensive to push the taliban from the northern province of kunduz .
but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 28.07.2009 eu urges progress on democracy and human rights in belarus großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : belarus foreign minister sergei martynov , left , is keen to improve ties with the eu the european union has called for the cash-strapped former soviet republic of belarus to step up reforms before it can expect any more financial help . belarus foreign minister sergei martynov met with senior eu officials in brussels on tuesday in an effort to bring his country , which has been hit hard by the economic crisis , closer to the european union .
the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2009 bundeswehr faces uphill battle against taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts says the bundeswehr will struggle to keep the taliban from returning german military and afghan forces are midway through a joint offensive to push the taliban from the northern province of kunduz .
but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 28.07.2009 high-rollers curb their spending at the world 's gambling hotspot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer visitors are rolling the dice in macau 's casinos even the global gambling capital is not immune to the economic crisis .
for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams .

both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 28.07.2009 wto says global crisis will boost doha round großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto chief pascal lamy is hoping for progress in global trade talks the world trade organization says there is renewed political commitment from the international community to successfully conclude the doha round .
the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.07.2009 rich countries told to boost aid spending to get deal on climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden is pushing for rich countries to come forward on their aid commitments wealthy countries should spend more on poor nations to prove their good faith in upcoming climate talks , according to a draft european union report .
this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de doping -pipe- 28.07.2009 report : suspicious substances found in tour de france trashcans großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no positive tests so far from this year 's tour , but not everyone 's convinced the race was clean the french anti-doping chief has told " le monde " that substances possibly used for doping were found in the trashcans of some tour de france teams .
he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

but managers in frankfurt are n't ready to celebrate just yet . deutsche bank ag reported a better-than-expected 68-percent surge in second-quarter profits on tuesday , powered by a strong recovery in global capital markets . the frankfurt-based bank , germany 's largest , said net profit jumped to 1.09 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- in the fourth , fifth , and sixth months of the year , up from 649 million euros in the same period in 2008 . the figure was better than the average 985 million euros forecast by economists in a thomson-reuters poll . the german lender was buoyed by the resumption of trading after global monetary and financial authorities injected hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the world financial system , trying to end the freeze in credit markets . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said upon releasing the results that he was hopeful that the global financial industry was emerging from the crisis that began to take hold in late 2007 .
the bank posted it first annual loss in half a century last year in the wake of the worldwide financial meltdown . " increased liquidiy and lower volatility in financial markets are both supportive for our business , " ackermann said , adding that the bank was well positioned " to take full advantage of opportunities , as and when business conditions improve . " investment banking has shown a rapid recovery recently .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .

but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

"
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

" we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 28.07.2009 bundeswehr faces uphill battle against taliban großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : analysts says the bundeswehr will struggle to keep the taliban from returning german military and afghan forces are midway through a joint offensive to push the taliban from the northern province of kunduz .
but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .
so the fresh money is only the first step .
hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .
the hamburg-based shipping company employs around 8.000 people. ai / reuters / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . a stroll through the lindenau district of leipzig is a must for any art lover in town - not least because it is home to the art movement known as the new leipzig school , which is centered around ateliers located in an old cotton mill . there , neo rauch and his contemporaries employ a unique blend of socialist realism to create distinctive and thought-provoking works of art . the d21 gallery - located just a short distance form the mill - embodies typical german suburbia , on the other hand .
there is a theater across the street , but in general the neighboring businesses reflect the necessities and habits of modern life : a pharmacist , two bakeries , and a pet shop .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german efforts to boost civilian development in afghanistan could suffer " it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

however , the cash-strapped company will need more support to weather the storm . hapag-lloyd has been suffering record losses since the global recession started to bite into the international trade and cargo business .
but the world 's fifth biggest cargo shipping company has now secured what it hopes will pave the way for state aid to help the company through the economic downturn .
a consortium of investors on tuesday agreed to buy stakes in a hamburg container terminal owned by hapag-lloyd .
the shipping company stands to receive 315 million euros through that move .
hannover-based tui , which holds 43 percent of hapag-lloyd , said in a statement that the 25.1 percent stake in the altenwerder container terminal would be bought by a company founded by shareholders of tui and investment group albert ballin gmbh & co .
kg .
tui will contribute 215 million euros .
the city of hamburg is injecting 76 million euros , and the insurance company signal iduna is taking a 24 million euro stake .
hamburg 's hsh nordbank will contribute an additional 15 million euros as a loan .
the plan calls for " hapag-lloyd to repurchase its share as soon as the economic situation permits , " a statement released by the company said .
hapag-lloyd 's shareholders " have agreed in principle to reach a decision over the next few weeks " on financing measures to support the company over the long term , the statement adds .
so the fresh money is only the first step .
hopes are pinned on guarantees from berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : government guarantees could save the company according to tui , the cash-strapped shipping company will apply for government guarantees on top of the 330 million euros .
hapag-lloyd reportedly needs as much as 1.75 billion euros in fresh capital to weather the storm .
in the first quarter of 2009 , the company lost 222 million euros and the situation on the market has not improved since then .
in 2008 , the company still brought in a profit of 211 million euros , but the economic slump has hit the entire shipping sector hard .
with the situation of the company deteriorating , securing new loans will also become increasingly difficult .
only recently , hapag-lloyd was downgraded by the moody 's rating agency .
the hamburg-based shipping company employs around 8.000 people. ai / reuters / ap editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have cut costs , reduced balance-sheet risk , and reinforced our liquidity and capital position , " he said . responding to concerns that germany may face a domestic credit crunch in the second half of 2009 , ackermann said deutsche bank was willing to extend credit to help the economy recover . " we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but analysts say keeping the insurgents from returning could be harder . military officials from the international security assistance force in afghanistan say there is a big chance that taliban-led violence could escalate across the country as afghan presidential elections , to be held on aug .
20 .
the stated goal of the german-afghan mission is to secure kunduz ahead of those elections .
the governor of kunduz , mohammad omar , said monday that progress has already been made in the offensive , which began last week and involves around 300 bundeswehr troops and 900 afghan security force personnel and police .
" we have been successful so far and have made headway , " he said .
" we have recaptured areas in which the taliban were active , for example , in the district of char darah . "
omar said the history of the region warranted the bundeswehr mission there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : afghan president hamid karzai will run for a second term " in the past this region was a political and military stronghold for the taliban .
when the regime was brought down in 2001 , hundreds of fighters fled to pakistan .
but because they know the area well , they have come back . "
good odds of success defense analyst charles heyman told deutsche welle that the chances of success for bundeswehr forces operating in the kunduz mission were relatively high .
" it 's quite possible that the operation in kunduz could have more success than the operations in the south .
i would expect , in fact , the operation in kunduz to be more successful and for the elections in that area to be safer and more secure . "
heyman said that around 80 percent of the violence in afghanistan occured in around 20 percent of the country , and that the northern regions were less hostile than those in the south .
neither the governor nor bundeswehr officials have said how long the operation in kunduz is going to last , and scant details on the mission have been released by the german and afghan governments .
but with the aim of shoring up security for the elections there is every chance it could run until late august .
changing conditions thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz could be successful , but that stopping them from returning could prove much more difficult .

if you press at one part of it , the bubbles stick out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
ruttig said that unstable military conditions in kunduz could also pose problems for the german government 's civilian programs in the region .
" the situation in kunduz has changed to the negative side , so much so that it has become very difficult to push forward the civilian side , " he said .
" this means helping build infrastructure , doing projects and supporting effective , working and responsible afghan leadership in that area .
i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i would n't talk about failure , but i would say that the framework and conditions have become very difficult . "
new rules on monday , germany 's defense ministry announced further changes to rules of engagement for german troops serving in afghanistan , allowing them to shoot at fleeing insurgents .
the development could increase the odds of success for the joint mission in kunduz .
meanwhile , the parliament of montenegro , which has aspirations for both european union and nato membership , has voted in favor of sending 40 troops and a medical unit to afghanistan to serve under german command .
the montenegrin defense minister , boro vucinic , said a three-man unit would also be sent to an eu-led maritime mission off the horn of africa aimed at halting pirate attacks on international ships. dfm / afp / dpa editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

but managers in frankfurt are n't ready to celebrate just yet . deutsche bank ag reported a better-than-expected 68-percent surge in second-quarter profits on tuesday , powered by a strong recovery in global capital markets . the frankfurt-based bank , germany 's largest , said net profit jumped to 1.09 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- in the fourth , fifth , and sixth months of the year , up from 649 million euros in the same period in 2008 . the figure was better than the average 985 million euros forecast by economists in a thomson-reuters poll . the german lender was buoyed by the resumption of trading after global monetary and financial authorities injected hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the world financial system , trying to end the freeze in credit markets . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said upon releasing the results that he was hopeful that the global financial industry was emerging from the crisis that began to take hold in late 2007 .
the bank posted it first annual loss in half a century last year in the wake of the worldwide financial meltdown .

" we have cut costs , reduced balance-sheet risk , and reinforced our liquidity and capital position , " he said . responding to concerns that germany may face a domestic credit crunch in the second half of 2009 , ackermann said deutsche bank was willing to extend credit to help the economy recover . " we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .

can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .

should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 28.07.2009 rich countries told to boost aid spending to get deal on climate change großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sweden is pushing for rich countries to come forward on their aid commitments wealthy countries should spend more on poor nations to prove their good faith in upcoming climate talks , according to a draft european union report .
this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .

" increased liquidiy and lower volatility in financial markets are both supportive for our business , " ackermann said , adding that the bank was well positioned " to take full advantage of opportunities , as and when business conditions improve . " investment banking has shown a rapid recovery recently .
two weeks ago , goldman sachs in the us far exceeded expectations for the second quarter .
deutsche bank 's net profits from corporate banking more than doubled . but that recovery has also prompted criticism that the banking industry has returned to " business as usual " while consumers and businesses are still suffering from the recession . rainy day preparations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's josef ackermann is hopeful about the direction of the financial markets despite deutsche bank 's solid performance , ackermann expressed caution about the prospects for the rest of the year . " the outlook for the remainder of 2009 is strongly influenced by the development of the global economy , " he said . ackerman also said the bank had taken precautions to face uncertain times ahead . " we have cut costs , reduced balance-sheet risk , and reinforced our liquidity and capital position , " he said . responding to concerns that germany may face a domestic credit crunch in the second half of 2009 , ackermann said deutsche bank was willing to extend credit to help the economy recover . " we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 28.07.2009 high-rollers curb their spending at the world 's gambling hotspot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer visitors are rolling the dice in macau 's casinos even the global gambling capital is not immune to the economic crisis .
for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .

polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .

the wto says a free-trade agreement is possible by the end of the year . meetings to revive the failed doha round are gathering steam in geneva .
the world trade organization says it has received renewed political commitments from heads of state and trade ministers to conclude an agreement by the end of 2010 .
pascal lamy , wto director-general , on tuesday said the global recession had served as a reminder of the importance of the doha talks .
" we all know this crisis is unprecedented in its width , in its depth , in its global impact .
we must act collectively to send the right signals and establish an appropriate trading environment for a sustainable recovery for all , " lamy said .
when the doha round collapsed three years ago , world trade was buoyant and it appeared as if the good economic times would never end .
the story now is very different .
wto economists predict world trade will shrink by 10 percent in 2009 , something , which has not happened since world war ii .
trade to lift the world out of the crisis wto spokesman , keith rockwell , said it was increasingly recognized that trade has been a victim of the economic crisis .
at the same time , he noted trade would be an important tool for lifting the world out of this crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : previous talks on the doha round have failed to make substantial progress " the market opening that will come through the doha round , will in effect be a global tax cut of about $ 150 billion .
these kinds of things can be an important stimulus for economic recovery , " he said .
rockwell adds that people , by and large , have resisted taking high intensity protectionist measures because they are aware that trade is contracting and such measures would hurt the economy and hamper the recovery .
wto warns against protectionism " despite that , there is a lot of domestic pressure for more protectionism in almost every country .
now , one way to keep trade open is to keep opening trade and that is what the doha round would do .
what we need to do now is to translate this very strong show of political support into action at the negotiating table here in geneva . "
the negotiations will not be easy .
the problems that scuttled the last agreement are complex and remain unresolved .
major disagreements over access to each other 's markets continue to divide the rich nations from the poor ones .
while the us , europe and japan try to press for access to gobal markets , emerging economies like brazil and india are reluctant to comply as long as developed countrys do n't drop their heavy subsidies for domestic production .
" we have come a long way , and probably not far from our journey 's end , " wto chief lamy said .
" but , we know that the last stretch will be an active and a tough one . "
as a seasoned marathon runner , lamy believes endurance and a single-minded determination to reach the goal is what will win the day . author : lisa schlein -lrb- ai -rrb- editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

he believes two new types of drugs were used at this year 's race . while many commentators praised what they said looked like a doping-free tour de france , the head of the french anti-doping agency afld , pierre bordry , said he suspects riders are still using performance-enhancing substances or methods . bordry told french daily le monde that medicines were found in some of the trashcans of some teams . " we found several strong medications , including a substance which produces insulin and is normally used for diabetes , " he said . after sunday 's tour finish without a since positive doping test , headlines were largely positive about a race not tainted by doping substances .
headlines appeared such as " drugs war is being won " or " tour chief hails clean race , " but bordry is not convinced . he said he believes that riders are having autologous blood transfusions and that two new types of doping substances were possibly used in the race , including one that has the same effect as epo , and another which increases strength and burns fat . bordry says methods for detecting the substances could be developed by the fall . too lax ? bordry was outspoken during the tour on the subject of doping which ruffled some feathers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : detection methods for new performance-enhancing drugs will be ready this fall bordry had accused the international cycling union -lrb- uci -rrb- , which was in charge of testing , of being too " lenient . "
he made the criticism after anti-doping officials were kept waiting for nearly an hour by the astana team in andorra last week during an early-morning doping control .
both tour winner alberto contador and lance armstrong , who took third place , rode for the astana team . " this is the tour de france and you ca n't wake up guys on a day of a mountain stage at 6am , " said lance armstrong after astana was criticized over the wait . the french anti-doping agency also announced it will retest some blood samples from 14 riders in last year 's tour de france in september and october , looking mainly for the banned blood-booster cera . " bordry 's ego has gotten too big .
he needs to come with facts or stay out of it , " said gerry van gerwen , head of the milram team . can doping be beat ? after the race ended on sunday , tour de france director christian prudhomme said he was pleased that no positive drug tests had returned , but he said the fight against doping in professional cycling is far from over . " we ca n't allow ourselves to believe that things have completely changed , this is a fight that will go on and on , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tour winner alberto contador says he race a clean race while some commentators breathed a sigh of relief that the tour was not dragged through the doping mire this year as it was in 2008 , others seemed resigned to the presence of a continual cat-and-mouse game of performance-enhancing drugs - their use , disguise and discovery . " the only surprising thing is that there are still doped athletes who are dumb enough to throw proof of their illegal activities into the trashcan , " wrote arnd festering in the german daily frankfurter rundschau . " that 's the only exciting thing : not whether any one used performance-enhancing drugs , but whether anyone was found out and who it was .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .

this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .

that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .
that 's why we ca n't say whether the virus will become a killer virus . but the risk is potentially there ? yes , it 's there , but it 's year every year , not just in 2009 . how effective would a vaccine now being developed be at protecting people this winter ? experts look at the structure of the virus currently circulating .
once it 's clear what its structure is , then vaccines are manufactured that contain these properties . basically , we have more than one vaccine available .
at present , we have access to eight different vaccines produced in various ways .
all of these vaccines should be available by september or october , and we expect that these vaccines will be helpful in fighting off the virus .
but , you have to administer two doses -lrb- an influenza shot is usually just one dose -rrb- , and in addition a vaccine exists for the seasonal virus .
so there are two shots for the pandemic virus and one for the seasonal , making a total of three . bildunterschrift : signs at german airports warn of the spread of swine flu through travel so , you believe that could cover possible dangers even if mutations occur ? yes , that 's what experts expect and predict . ahead of winter , however , the rest of germany 's states will end their summer vacation at the end of august .
places where holidays are already coming to a close have seen the increase in swine flue cases .
do you expect another jump in cases across germany at the end of august ? we expect a continual increase of suspected and actual cases of infected people at the end of summer when people return from vacations . do you have any advice for people who are worried ? people should n't panic !
people should take every precaution they can with personal hygiene , like washing their hands frequently , coughing and sneezing into their shirtsleeves rather than into their hands or out into the open air .
but , people still should n't panic about the virus . interview : louisa schaefer editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 28.07.2009 no reason for swine flu panic in germany , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : swine flu has been declared a pandemic by the world health organization the rate of swine flu cases has increased dramatically in recent days in germany , but an expert at berlin 's charite hospital told deutsche welle that the jump has n't come as a complete surprise . the spread of the infection in germany was n't surprising since many people have been returning from vacation spots , including spain , where they are thought to have caught the virus , joerg hofmann of the institute of virology at the charite - universitaetsmedizin berlin told deutsche welle . germany 's infectious disease center , the robert koch institute , said there were 3,810 confirmed cases of swine flu , also called a -lrb- h1n1 -rrb- on monday .
that marks an increase of 461 cases in three days . deutsche welle : is the swine flu becoming more dangerous in germany ?
is it time for germans to get nervous ? joerg hofmann : no one needs to get nervous .
we have expected an increase in suspected cases as well as infected people , especially when people return from vacation from endemic areas from the virus is circulating . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : experts are encouraging people not to panic there have been a lot of cases in germany and nearly all are proving to be mild .
can you explain why that 's the case ? the main reason is the properties of the virus itself .
when a virus wants to replicate , it has to infect a host cell , and the outcome of this infection depends mostly on the properties of the virus itself .
that would mean in this case that the virus is not that virulent in the host - a spread of the viral infection in the body is limited , so that is why people are not getting seriously sick . germany has an ageing population , but the virus affects mainly young people .
should n't the number of cases be somewhat limited in relation to the population ? it should be , but what we see in fact is that germany has the second highest level of infected people in europe after great britain , so there seems to be no correlation between the mean age of the population and virus distribution . also , experts are n't sure why younger people are more affected , but they suspect that older people may still have some immunity toward a virus that may circulated 20 or 30 years ago .
so they are possibly benefitting from this immunity which younger people may not have .
but hat is all speculation - nothing is certain yet . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : good personal hygiene , like sneezing into tissues , can prevent spreading the virus there was talk of possible mutation of the virus ahead of the northern hemisphere 's winter and the increase of influenza cases .
is that still a serious concern ? that 's always a concern .
with the influenza viruses , which are known to be quite variable and change their genetic material and viral proteins , we expect a change in structure and the relation of the virus to the host cells , but we can not predict anything about how the virus will be in late wintertime .
that is why we need a new influenza vaccine each year , because the virus mutates . in this case , some changes will happen , but we can not predict them .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 28.07.2009 high-rollers curb their spending at the world 's gambling hotspot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer visitors are rolling the dice in macau 's casinos even the global gambling capital is not immune to the economic crisis .
for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de entertainment -pipe- 28.07.2009 high-rollers curb their spending at the world 's gambling hotspot großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fewer visitors are rolling the dice in macau 's casinos even the global gambling capital is not immune to the economic crisis .
for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .

this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .
the eu has said it could take until november to make a decision on the proposed merger. mrh / dpa / afp editor : neil king send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu 's executive , the european commission , has received the new proposal from lufthansa , and will analyze the offer to see whether it is in line with eu competition rules , commission spokeswoman maria assimakopoulou told journalists in brussels .
on monday , a report in the austrian newspaper kurier said that as part of the deal , lufthansa was prepared to give up key slots in order to get the aua deal approved in brussels .
the german carrier was ready to hand six of its 10 take-off and landing slots between vienna and frankfurt to its competitors , including austrian low-cost airline niki and slovenia 's adria airways , the report said .
it is the third set of proposals which lufthansa has sent the commission in its bid to take over austrian and become the largest airline in europe by passenger numbers .
kind of a big deal lufthansa originally agreed to buy the austrian state 's 42-per-cent stake in its debt-ridden national carrier in december for 366,000 euros -lrb- $ 510,000 -rrb- .
but the european commission , which is charged with ensuring that takeover deals do not give any single company too much power , warned that the deal could give lufthansa too much influence on routes out of germany .
the cologne-headquartered carrier then presented a revised proposal in the spring , but commission officials said that they liked it even less than the original .
separately , on tuesday lufthansa said that it wanted to extend a 31 july deadline with the austrian competition authorities by a month , to allow the german carrier more time to meet eu requirements .

but managers in frankfurt are n't ready to celebrate just yet . deutsche bank ag reported a better-than-expected 68-percent surge in second-quarter profits on tuesday , powered by a strong recovery in global capital markets . the frankfurt-based bank , germany 's largest , said net profit jumped to 1.09 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.55 billion -rrb- in the fourth , fifth , and sixth months of the year , up from 649 million euros in the same period in 2008 . the figure was better than the average 985 million euros forecast by economists in a thomson-reuters poll . the german lender was buoyed by the resumption of trading after global monetary and financial authorities injected hundreds of billions of dollars of liquidity into the world financial system , trying to end the freeze in credit markets . deutsche bank chief josef ackermann said upon releasing the results that he was hopeful that the global financial industry was emerging from the crisis that began to take hold in late 2007 .
the bank posted it first annual loss in half a century last year in the wake of the worldwide financial meltdown . " increased liquidiy and lower volatility in financial markets are both supportive for our business , " ackermann said , adding that the bank was well positioned " to take full advantage of opportunities , as and when business conditions improve . " investment banking has shown a rapid recovery recently .
two weeks ago , goldman sachs in the us far exceeded expectations for the second quarter .
deutsche bank 's net profits from corporate banking more than doubled . but that recovery has also prompted criticism that the banking industry has returned to " business as usual " while consumers and businesses are still suffering from the recession . rainy day preparations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank 's josef ackermann is hopeful about the direction of the financial markets despite deutsche bank 's solid performance , ackermann expressed caution about the prospects for the rest of the year . " the outlook for the remainder of 2009 is strongly influenced by the development of the global economy , " he said . ackerman also said the bank had taken precautions to face uncertain times ahead . " we have cut costs , reduced balance-sheet risk , and reinforced our liquidity and capital position , " he said . responding to concerns that germany may face a domestic credit crunch in the second half of 2009 , ackermann said deutsche bank was willing to extend credit to help the economy recover . " we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .

this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .

its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .
the gaming industry itself apparently was n't preprared for tough times either .
in the midst of one of the worst economic slumps in decades , macau 's table game capacity is expected to increase this year by 24 percent compared to last year . all about gambling what 's more , unlike other gambling destinations like las vegas or atlantic city which have tried to diversify over the years and feature many other entertainment options , macau still has one main attraction : " the macau market is totally different from other markets , " explains chan .
" in las vegas you spend your time on shows and other things .
but in macau it 's all about gaming . "
while its unique focus on gambling may have helped in the past , it may now hurt macau .
tourists coming to las vegas stay for approxamately four days .
the majority of macau visitors are day-trippers , who do n't care about luxury hotel rooms , shows or concerts .
they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .
" since the beginning of this year there has been a decrease of arrivals in macau " , says sandra carvao , deputy chief of the world tourism organization 's -lrb- unwto -rrb- market department in madrid : " they have seen up to date a reduction of nine percent in their arrivals of tourists , which is pretty much in line with what happened in asia overall . "
new travel restrictions in addition , beijing also spoiled some of the casino fun last year , when it tightened its travel restrictions for citizens wanting to visit macau .
the move was seen as an attempt to make it more difficult for chinese people to gamble there .
earlier , visitors needed only a single travel permit for both hong kong and macau .
now tourists need two separate visas for both destinations , which are only one hour by ferry apart .
" if there is a reduction of movement , " says carvao , " there will also be a reduction in the income that the casinos have . "
consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .
" in the past a lot of the vip 's said they went to hong kong for shopping and went to macau instead , ” says credit suisse analyst chan .
" that is why i think that visa restrictions had no impact on the mass market , but had some on the vip market indeed . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is no shortage of space at macau 's tables while chan believes that china 's new travel rules contributed to the downturn on macau , he does n't think they are its main cause : " although people are restricted to go individually to macau , they still can go there when they join a package tour . "
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time macau 's multi-billion dollar business is suffering .
but the financial downturn is not the only reason . gambling is everything in macau , the former portuguese colony , now a chinese special administrative region .
its 500,000 citizens welcome 30 million visitors every year , most of them from mainland china and hong kong .
the peninsula in the southeast of china is a huge attraction for one reason : macau is the only place in china , where casinos are legal .
and while macau has been a gambling hotspot for a long time , business really took off after a 40-year old monopoly on casino gambling in the former portuguese colony was lifted seven years ago .
the liberalisation triggered a massive boom that has catapulted the city to the top of the world 's gambling resorts .
it is now the biggest international gambling market by revenue , having edged past las vegas since 2006 .
in fact , macau now rakes in more money than two of the major us gaming destinations , las vegas and atlantic city , combined .
most of the revenue stems from gaming-related taxes , the main source of income for macau 's government .
but with the global economic crisis continuing , for the first time , casinos in china 's special administrative region are hurting .
macau 's gambling revenue slipped by more than 12 percent in the first six months of this year to 6.4 billion dollars compared to the first half of 2008 . gabriel chan , a gaming analyst with credit suisse in nearby hong kong , admits that like many other experts he may have underestimated the impact of the economic crisis on the gaming industry .
" i guess people were too confident before , " he says .
" in the case of macau , people , including myself , did n't realize that recession could affect liquidity in the economy that much . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many new casinos opened with great fanfare in macau after the gambling market was liberalized analysts like chan were n't the only ones who were taken by suprise by the severe downturn .

they want to maximize their time on the game table .
more than in las vegas high-rollers try their luck in macau .
bets of one million or more euros at the black-jack table are all but unusual .
but the number of visitors hoping to hit the jack pot on the tiny peninsula is dropping .

consequently many experts blame china 's stricter visa rules for a substantial part of the revenue losses .

"
with the crisis continuing , some new projects have now been put on hold .
still , if the economic malaise persists , all bets on whether macau will continue its stunning growth as the world 's gambling mecca are off for now .
but at least on one front there is light at the end of the tunnel , predicts tourism expert carvao .
she believes that beijing will soon loosen its travel policy again : " i think this will be a temporary situation , ” she says .
" it 's also in the interest of china to stimulate outbound travel , because that will be beneficial for their transport companies and tour operating companies . "
given the fact that for millions of chinese macau is the only casino destination to go to , that could provide a desperately needed boost for the city .

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

distanced from the establishment , they are the real avant-garde of the art world .
this week , dw takes a closer look at several of them . a stroll through the lindenau district of leipzig is a must for any art lover in town - not least because it is home to the art movement known as the new leipzig school , which is centered around ateliers located in an old cotton mill . there , neo rauch and his contemporaries employ a unique blend of socialist realism to create distinctive and thought-provoking works of art . the d21 gallery - located just a short distance form the mill - embodies typical german suburbia , on the other hand .
there is a theater across the street , but in general the neighboring businesses reflect the necessities and habits of modern life : a pharmacist , two bakeries , and a pet shop . " we consciously moved here three years ago , " said curator michael moser , 35 . " in this underdeveloped area there is the possibility of creating something new . we want to build a counterbalance to the hype surrounding the leipzig school and sought to create a gallery in this non-commercial district . " the formula has proven to be a success . slowly but surely the district of lindenau has been developing . whoever takes the trouble to explore the neighboring side-streets will stumble across half a dozen other small galleries which owe their existence to d21 . bildunterschrift : michael moser , 35 , is a volunteer curator d21 relies on volunteers the 85-square-meter -lrb- 915-square-foot -rrb- gallery derives its name from its address , demmringstrasse 21 - a location steeped in local history . " this used to be a hair salon , but that is going back a long way , " said 24-year-old gallery volunteer regine ehleiter . going even further back , the building was once a guardhouse dating from the industrial revolution . after renting the space , moser and his team spent the first few months preparing the building , plastering the walls , and tearing out the old ceiling . " that was a really tough job , and that 's why we do n't pay rent , just 300 euros -lrb- $ 427 -rrb- a month for electricity , water , and any other costs that come up , " moser and ehleiter said .
if the price was any higher , the project would be jeopardized . the non-profit group of artists responsible for financing the gallery consists of 30 members , including seven dedicated curators .
some of them support the project financially by paying a 30-euro membership fee , while others choose to donate their time . " we need both kinds of people , " said moser . bildunterschrift : the gallery organizes thematic exhibitions and seeks up-and-coming artists from around the world funding is crucial moser is a photographer and ehleiter an art student .
most of the other members are also students . those able to spare time and lend a hand are asked to watch over the exhibition room , advertise the gallery by word of mouth , and help out with the general upkeep . the group aims for five to six exhibitions a year , but that is dependent on the financial grants it received from the city of leipzig , and from the regional and federal governments .
michael moser considers the grants " recognition of our work and as a sign that we are doing a good job here . " since the members of the association work on a voluntary basis , all of the grant money can be pumped into financing the exhibitions . organizing a single show can cost up to several thousand euros , including expenses for travel and transport of the artwork , redecorating the gallery space , printing flyers and royalties for the participating artists . windows open doors to art the gallery members do n't display their own works in the exhibition space , but look for promising , young artists from around the world who would not otherwise have a presence in leipzig . exhibitions of individual artists are a rarity , as d21 prefers to organize thematic shows that highlight works by several up-and-coming artists . " we want to display art that would otherwise not receive a platform , " explained regine ehleiter .
" we have also sold paintings , but nothing worth mentioning . " passing trade is practically non-existent as " most residents in the area do not dare enter , even when the door is left wide open , " said ehleiter .
" to change this , we take advantage of the building 's large windows and try to draw people in to create a customer base . the windows are a tool that can be used to communicate with the public . " there is no intention of ever letting d21 become a commercial gallery , even in the distant future . for ehleiter , the gallery is not about turning a profit : her reward is measured in a different currency . " i profit by simply working here .
no seminar in cultural management would be able to teach me what i have learned in the previous three years working here .

the european union says it might be inclined to offer financial assistance , but also insists belarus has not done enough on reforms or human rights .
eu external relations chief benita ferrero waldner told a joint news conference with the belarussian foreign minister : " we stand ready to support and re-engage with belarus , if indeed belarus shows to be very serious in pursuing the moves towards democracy , and fundamental freedoms . "
she added that the eu could " unlock the full potential of our relationship if indeed convincing and irreversible reforms will be there . "
the eu has included belarus as one of six eastern neighbors that could eventually benefit from partnership agreements , covering trade , visa liberalization and closer political ties .
relations with belarus are considered key to the battle of influence between europe and russia , over the countries wedged between them .
eu financial assistance would be funnelled through the international monetary fund , which last month signalled it could increase its loan to the former soviet satellite by roughly $ 1 billion .
this would add to the $ 2 billion already lent to belarus , and another $ 2 billion borrowed from russia .
belarus laments travel restrictions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a symbol ?
polotsk in belarus claims to be europe 's geographical center belarus foreign minister sergei martynov said he really wanted to see visa travel made easier for his country 's citizens : " visa facilitation is an obvious priority , our citizens and residents of belarus can not accept the fact that they have to pay at least twice as much as their neighbors pay for their visas , and also to have an extremely cumbersome and lengthy procedure of having visas to the schengen zone . "
that , the foreign minister said , stands in the way of free travel in europe , and has to be remedied .
the eu says visa-free travel , closer trade relations and financial assistance are all possible - but only if belarus delivers on reforms , which will again be reviewed in the autumn .
recent reform moves by president alexander lukashenko have already been rewarded by the eu , which recently lifted sanctions , including a travel ban for belarussian officials .
all in all , foreign minister martynov did not leave brussels empty-handed : insiders say the fact that he was invited to brussels is already a sign that relations are looking up .

the bank posted it first annual loss in half a century last year in the wake of the worldwide financial meltdown .

" we are going to help out clients , just as we have been doing , in this difficult credit environment , " he said . shares of deutsche bank , although up 77 percent this year , fell 5.3 percent in frankfurt trading tuesday morning . mrh / jam / dpa / afp editor : charles penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes as negotiations appear to be deadlocked over costs . the draft report recommends an immediate $ 1-2 billion -lrb- up to 1.4 billion euros -rrb- to assist poor countries vulnerable to climate change , as a sign of good faith .
" a specific eu commitment is desirable before copenhagen , " the report said .
the report by the european commission and sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency , is expected to be finalized in the coming weeks .
it comes as eu environment ministers meet in sweden to prepare for december 's un conference in copenhagen , which is supposed to produce a strong treaty to tackle climate change .
although prospects for a deal to limit greenhouse gas emissions have improved this year , with the us and china showing more engagement on the issue , the question of who should pay for fixing the problem remains divisive .
the so-called adaptation fund is one of the key areas of contention .
it is supposed to help developing countries cope with global-warming-induced changes to their environment , which are expected to include the loss of arable land , pressure on water resources and a higher frequency of natural disasters .
there are concerns that developing countries will not be interested in pledging emissions cuts if the rich world does n't help them pay for a problem largely blamed on the west 's industrialization .
" clarifying and increasing the global contribution to adaptation funding between now and 2012 could contribute significantly to trust-building with least developed countries , " sweden 's draft report said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pacific islands are particularly at risk from rising sea levels put your money where your mouth is it also calls on oecd countries to fulfill their existing foreign aid pledges , raising assistance from 0.3 percent of national income to 0.7 percent .
this would amount to around $ 280 billion annually by 2015 .
but in a suggestion likely to disappoint development advocates , the report recommends that contributions to the adaptation fund should only be made over and above current oecd aid spending , around $ 120 billion , not current oecd pledges . " the big flows of money after copenhagen , should be on top of that 0.7 percent , " oxfam climate campaigner tim gore told the reuters news agency .
" we must not divert funds that would otherwise be spent on schools and hospitals . "
oxfam wants the developed world to spend at least $ 50 billion per year on adaptation , on top of any regular aid payments .
meanwhile , environmental activists have been meeting in the bangaldeshi capital dhaka to establish a common declaration on behalf of developing countries at copenhagen .
" it is a matter of life and death for us , " said the bangladeshi environment minister mostafizur rahman , whose country is one of those most vulnerable to climate change .
around 20 percent of bangladesh would be submerged if sea levels rise by one metre .
scientists fear that sea levels could rise by up to 88 centimetres this century . # b # oxfam , together with the australia institute think tank , released a report on monday warning that rising sea levels could trigger up to 75 million refugees in the asia pacific region over the next 40 years. nw / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for international cricket to continue at the ground gloucestershire county cricket club must provide a minimum of 18,000 seats for bigger matches .

by the us military 's own reckoning , mosul and its surrounding region is the most dangerous area in iraq .
on average they calculate there are four attacks here every day - explosions , shootings , suicide bombings .
that is down from six per day in january - progress , of sorts .
since 30 june , iraqi forces have been entirely responsible for maintaining security in urban areas .
but the americans want to keep a close eye .
so they are maintaining a limited number of joint patrols inside cities like mosul .
lt joel brown was going into mosul for the first time since the handover .
when he and his platoon were last in the city , they came under attack - a grenade was thrown at their convoy from one of the many narrow alleyways along their route .
" the grenade thrower was right behind that red car , " lt brown said , pointing out of the window of his armoured humvee .
" it bounced off the humvee and blew up on the ground . "
on the roof of the vehicle , a gunner swept the road from right to left , watching for similar threats .
many of the buildings on the way into town had either been reduced to rubble or were pockmarked by bullets .
six years after the us-led invasion , mosul still looks like a city at war .
visible presence the convoy consisted of five heavily armed vehicles : three american and two iraqi , one each at the front and back - our escort , required under the terms of the handover agreement .
the iraqi security forces were maintaining a highly visible presence on the streets of mosul : checkpoints at almost every corner , watchtowers and more armoured vehicles .
the iraqi police have come a long way ...
their proficiency , their ability to get the job done , is going to work me out of a job , which is good , which i 'm looking forward to cpt brian panaro , us army our destination was a large area of wasteland in the south-west of the city .
officially , the reason for the us patrol was to oversee a project to clear rubbish from the area .
" what we 're trying to do is to is get all these wrecked vehicles , trash , get that all moved out of here , " lt brown said .
" it 'll help stimulate the economy as well as accomplish a major project here in the west side of mosul . "
there was plenty to do .
an open sewer ran along the street , as goats and geese nosed around in the rubbish , discarded shoes , bottles and plastic bags .
a dog with three legs barked mournfully as it sat in the blazing sun outside a house built of concrete breeze-blocks .
but lt brown and the roughly 130,000 other us troops still stationed in iraq are more than just heavily armed garbage men .
in mosul , the threat of violence is never far off .
suddenly a shot rang out from the direction of a sandbagged watchtower at the end of the street .
a warning shot , lt brown said , fired by one of the iraqis manning a checkpoint .
no one was injured in the shooting , but the americans did n't stay to find what had prompted it .
the patrol was attracting increasingly unfriendly-looking attention from many of the local residents in the area , unused by now to the presence of us forces in town .
so they got back in their humvees and headed back to base .
new rules following the handover , patrols to monitor reconstruction projects are a good way for the americans to get their boots , eyes and ears back on the ground inside the cities .
but there are new rules in place - they have to ask for permission and an escort from the local iraqi security forces .
lt gen abbas negotiates the details of a convoy from a position of strength co-operation is not always smooth , involving patient persuasion and impassioned gesticulation - plenty of head-scratching , the comparing of maps and a little bargaining .
" how many vehicles do you have ? "
lt gen majed abbas of the iraqi police force asked lt brown before they set off .
when he was told they had four , he told the americans could bring only three .
one would have to be left behind .

by the us military 's own reckoning , mosul and its surrounding region is the most dangerous area in iraq .
on average they calculate there are four attacks here every day - explosions , shootings , suicide bombings .
that is down from six per day in january - progress , of sorts .
since 30 june , iraqi forces have been entirely responsible for maintaining security in urban areas .
but the americans want to keep a close eye .
so they are maintaining a limited number of joint patrols inside cities like mosul .
lt joel brown was going into mosul for the first time since the handover .
when he and his platoon were last in the city , they came under attack - a grenade was thrown at their convoy from one of the many narrow alleyways along their route .
" the grenade thrower was right behind that red car , " lt brown said , pointing out of the window of his armoured humvee .
" it bounced off the humvee and blew up on the ground . "
on the roof of the vehicle , a gunner swept the road from right to left , watching for similar threats .
many of the buildings on the way into town had either been reduced to rubble or were pockmarked by bullets .
six years after the us-led invasion , mosul still looks like a city at war .
visible presence the convoy consisted of five heavily armed vehicles : three american and two iraqi , one each at the front and back - our escort , required under the terms of the handover agreement .
the iraqi security forces were maintaining a highly visible presence on the streets of mosul : checkpoints at almost every corner , watchtowers and more armoured vehicles .
the iraqi police have come a long way ...
their proficiency , their ability to get the job done , is going to work me out of a job , which is good , which i 'm looking forward to cpt brian panaro , us army our destination was a large area of wasteland in the south-west of the city .
officially , the reason for the us patrol was to oversee a project to clear rubbish from the area .
" what we 're trying to do is to is get all these wrecked vehicles , trash , get that all moved out of here , " lt brown said .
" it 'll help stimulate the economy as well as accomplish a major project here in the west side of mosul . "
there was plenty to do .
an open sewer ran along the street , as goats and geese nosed around in the rubbish , discarded shoes , bottles and plastic bags .
a dog with three legs barked mournfully as it sat in the blazing sun outside a house built of concrete breeze-blocks .
but lt brown and the roughly 130,000 other us troops still stationed in iraq are more than just heavily armed garbage men .
in mosul , the threat of violence is never far off .
suddenly a shot rang out from the direction of a sandbagged watchtower at the end of the street .
a warning shot , lt brown said , fired by one of the iraqis manning a checkpoint .
no one was injured in the shooting , but the americans did n't stay to find what had prompted it .
the patrol was attracting increasingly unfriendly-looking attention from many of the local residents in the area , unused by now to the presence of us forces in town .
so they got back in their humvees and headed back to base .
new rules following the handover , patrols to monitor reconstruction projects are a good way for the americans to get their boots , eyes and ears back on the ground inside the cities .
but there are new rules in place - they have to ask for permission and an escort from the local iraqi security forces .
lt gen abbas negotiates the details of a convoy from a position of strength co-operation is not always smooth , involving patient persuasion and impassioned gesticulation - plenty of head-scratching , the comparing of maps and a little bargaining .
" how many vehicles do you have ? "
lt gen majed abbas of the iraqi police force asked lt brown before they set off .
when he was told they had four , he told the americans could bring only three .
one would have to be left behind .
the whole process took place with the help of interpreters , and the traditional glasses of sweet black tea .
everyone was friendly , but the iraqis were clearly keen to emphasise that they were now in charge .
gains the smaller towns and villages just a few kilometres south of mosul present a different picture from the city itself .
here us troops are freer in their movements , though they still bring an iraqi escort when they go out on patrol .
