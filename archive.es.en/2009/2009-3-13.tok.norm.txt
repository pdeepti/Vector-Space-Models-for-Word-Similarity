" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .

g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.03.2009 merkel rejects calls for new stimulus package before g20 meeting großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel wants a new regulatory system , not more spending german chancellor angela merkel has reiterated that she does not favor a new package of economic stimulus measures despite us calls for more spending as world leaders prepare for a g20 meeting in london . " we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii .

the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii . "
the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .
" there is nothing about mass murders in darfur , nothing about genital mutilation , stoning or racial terror , " he said . unfounded concerns ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un high commissioner for human rights navi pillay says there is no need for concern the un high commissioner for human rights navanethem pillay said on monday there was no need for the united states and other western countries to fear the geneva conference on racism would be tainted by anti-semitism .
" i am fully aware that the legacy of the 2001 durban conference has been tainted by the anti-semitic behaviour of some ngos at the sidelines of that conference , " pillay said as she addressed the un human rights council earlier this week . " and now the -lrb- geneva -rrb- review conference has also been the target of a disparaging media and lobbying campaign on the part of those who fear a repetition of anti-semitic outbursts , " she said , adding : " this is unwarranted .

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .

no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .

" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .

he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .

the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom .

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .

a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .

" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .
" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .
" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii .

the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .

" and now the -lrb- geneva -rrb- review conference has also been the target of a disparaging media and lobbying campaign on the part of those who fear a repetition of anti-semitic outbursts , " she said , adding : " this is unwarranted .

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii . "
the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .
" there is nothing about mass murders in darfur , nothing about genital mutilation , stoning or racial terror , " he said . unfounded concerns ?

" i am fully aware that the legacy of the 2001 durban conference has been tainted by the anti-semitic behaviour of some ngos at the sidelines of that conference , " pillay said as she addressed the un human rights council earlier this week . " and now the -lrb- geneva -rrb- review conference has also been the target of a disparaging media and lobbying campaign on the part of those who fear a repetition of anti-semitic outbursts , " she said , adding : " this is unwarranted .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii .

the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .

" i am fully aware that the legacy of the 2001 durban conference has been tainted by the anti-semitic behaviour of some ngos at the sidelines of that conference , " pillay said as she addressed the un human rights council earlier this week . " and now the -lrb- geneva -rrb- review conference has also been the target of a disparaging media and lobbying campaign on the part of those who fear a repetition of anti-semitic outbursts , " she said , adding : " this is unwarranted .

measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii . "
the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .
" there is nothing about mass murders in darfur , nothing about genital mutilation , stoning or racial terror , " he said . unfounded concerns ?

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .
" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .

g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .

however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .

g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .

however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .

police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .

" we do not think much of the idea of a new package of measures " to underpin the economy , merkel told a press conference in munich on friday , march 13 , after a meeting with employers .
splits have emerged ahead of a meeting in london on saturday of the group of 20 finance chiefs , with the united states and japan backing more stimulus spending and european leaders pushing tougher regulations as the best way out of the global economic crisis .
the g20 group of developed and emerging economies will discuss measures to get their economies back on track at an april 2 summit in the british capital .
just three weeks before the april summit , discord seems to outweigh lip service to coordination .
a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a german-french drive to focus on cross-border rules for finance is further souring the air .
" we have agreed that germany and france will send a common signal at this summit " on april 2 , german chancellor angela merkel said at a joint press conference with french president nicolas sarkozy in berlin on thursday .
" the issue is not spending even more but to put in place a regulatory system to prevent the economic catastrophe that the world is experiencing from being repeated , " merkel said in a direct rebuttal to us calls for more spending .
there must be " regulation and transparency of financial markets , " she said .
" we consider that in europe , we have already invested considerably , " sarkozy told reporters .
countries like france and germany feel they have already drawn up substantial stimulus packages , with berlin drafting two plans worth a total 81 billion euros -lrb- $ 104 billion -rrb- .
europe wary of obama 's pump-priming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama signed off on a stimulus bill which dwarfs the eu 's efforts us president barack obama , who enacted a $ 787-billion stimulus bill last month , tried to bridge the gap on wednesday , calling for a two-pronged g20 effort to fix the global economy : stimulus measures and regulatory reforms .
but after a meeting of euro zone finance ministers this week , their chairman prime minister jean-claude juncker of luxembourg rejected the us calls for more pump-priming by other g20 economies , declaring such proposals " do not suit us . "
juncker , after conferring with czech officials in prague on thursday , again voiced opposition to any additional spending plan to combat the crisis .
" the european recovery program represents a spending level of 3.4 to 4.0 percent of gdp , " he said .
" our public finances are beginning to suffer and we must take account of the effects these programs will have in 2009 and 2010 before we undertake additional spending . "
the us stimulus is substantially more than the 400 billion euros engaged by the 27 eu countries .
the two total economies are of comparable size , but the eu has not forged an integrated response .
us eager to inject more cash ; europe balks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to pump more dollars into the economy us treasury secretary timothy geithner has also called for the international monetary fund 's " new arrangements to borrow " credit program to be boosted to $ 500 billion - far more than proposed by the europeans .
for the whole of 2009 , britain is chairing meetings of the g20 - a grouping of 19 developed and developing countries plus the european union .
g20 nations include china , germany , japan , mexico , turkey and the united states .
the main point of contention appears to be a push by the united states and britain - which have angled much of their rescue spending on boosting demand - for some leading eu countries to do likewise .
the united states and britain have included heavy demand-side measures , such as a cut in sales tax in britain , because they stimulate activity quickly .
europeans accused of being too industry-focused bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel want to protect their industrial sectors they argue broadly that some countries , principally germany but also france , have focused unduly on increasing state spending on investment in industry and infrastructure and should now allocate extra funds to spark consumption .
however , leading countries in europe face constraints on their big budget deficits , which are rising markedly above eu limits .
german officials have also begun to talk about " exit strategies " from the massive state spending and support program once the crisis begins to abate .
european commission chief jose manuel barroso on thursday defended europe 's efforts to soften the blow of the global crisis .
" the social system of europe is very different from the american one , " he told a news conference in brussels .
" we have , compared to the us , a very ambitious system of social safety nets , in terms of unemployment , in terms of public health and in many other areas .
" so when we talk about fiscal stimulus , it 's not the same thing in the us and in europe because the americans usually think about discretionary additional fiscal stimulus , " he said . nda / th / afp / ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .

they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii .

the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .
" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.03.2009 german police doubt teenage gunman posted internet warning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german schools have been put on alert for copy-cat attacks police say a the alleged chatroom warning from the teenager who killed 15 people in a shooting rampage could be fake , while four hoaxers have been arrested across europe for threatening posts on the internet . a spokesman for waiblingen police said there was no record on the winnenden youth 's computer that he had logged into the chat forum on the eve of the albertville school massacre , but were questioning witnesses who reported seeing the entry to clarify if and when such a threat was made . " doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .

the austrian finance minister josef proell told reporters that national banks would cooperate by exchanging tax data only in cases where an official probe has been initiated .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .

" he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .

" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .

" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .
he was one of the most wanted people in both germany and italy . ls / sp / th / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .
" we received a letter saying ' to mr. adam ries ' on it , with the request to pay his television and radio fees , " said annegret muench , who now heads the club .
muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .
but the inexhaustible gez fees office nonetheless saw fit to send a reminder notice a few weeks later , albeit 450 years too late .
this was not the first time the gez has pursued germans into the afterlife looking for money .
last year , a school named after poet friedrich schiller received a reminder asking him to declare all radios and televisions in his home and pay the corresponding fees . dfm / th / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" germany must boycott this anti-semitic and anti-western spectacle , " koehler , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said . koehler was referring to a final declaration statement prepared for the conference in which islamic member states plan to urge the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation . critics say the sections could limit freedom of religion or speech .
they fear the conference will be hijacked by islamic countries keen to protect their religion from criticism and focus fire on israel . a number of countries including australia , the us , canada , italy and israel said they were withdrawing from the conference unless the wording of the document they consider hostile to israel is altered before the gathering starts . a petition to boycott the event bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamic countries want the un to forbid blasphemy and religious defamation in germany , a group of ngos , publicists and former politicians has started a petition called " boycott durban ii . "
the petition refers to the first un conference on racism held in durban , south africa in 2001 .
the us and israel walked out of that conference to protest against an attempted resolution comparing zionism to racism .
according to spiegel online , 1,300 people have signed up so far , including authors peter schneider , ralph giordano und women 's rights activist seyran ates .
german social democrat klaus faber told spiegel the final declaration statement is one-sided .
" there is nothing about mass murders in darfur , nothing about genital mutilation , stoning or racial terror , " he said . unfounded concerns ?

" i am fully aware that the legacy of the 2001 durban conference has been tainted by the anti-semitic behaviour of some ngos at the sidelines of that conference , " pillay said as she addressed the un human rights council earlier this week . " and now the -lrb- geneva -rrb- review conference has also been the target of a disparaging media and lobbying campaign on the part of those who fear a repetition of anti-semitic outbursts , " she said , adding : " this is unwarranted .

the man 's brother-in-law was also arrested during the operation . suspected italian mobster giovanni strangio , 30 , was taken into custody late thursday in amsterdam .
strangio was arrested in the town of diemen , where he has been living with his wife and child in a modest block of apartments .
strangio is accused of having taken part in a 2007 shooting in which six men were gunned down outside a pizzeria in the western german city of duisburg .
italy 's ansa news agency reported that strangio 's brother-in-law giuseppe nirta , also wanted for his mafia connections and activity , was also arrested in the joint operation between dutch , german and italian police .
measures such as telephone wire tapping and surveillance were used to locate the men .
authorities believe the killings in duisburg were the bloodiest episode in a long-running fight between two rival clans of the mafia , nirta-strangio and pelle-vottari , from calabria in southern italy , known as the ' ndrangheta .
the ' ndrangheta is considered one of the most powerful italian mafia groups .
victims shot in their cars the shootings in duisburg grabbed headlines in germany , underscoring the group 's wide network in europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : strangio had been living a secluded life in a town near amsterdam witnesses said they saw two attackers fire about 70 bullets at the six victims , aged 16 to 39 , as they were sitting in their cars after leaving the da bruno restaurant in the industrial city .
after the shooting , strangio and nirta allegedly fled to ghent , belgium where they abandoned a rental car and fell off the radar .
according to renato cortese , the italian policeman who coordinated thursday 's arrests , " the two led perfectly normal lives , mingling with people in amsterdam , but often wearing disguises , including hats and spectacles . "
strangio , his wife caterina and their son were " getting ready for bed , " when police raided their apartment , cortese told the italian news agency ansa .
police also seized fake passports , other documents and an estimated 1million euros -lrb- $ 1.28 million -rrb- in cash and a firearm with ammunition .
police said they had begun closing in on the whereabouts of the two men after three of strangio 's sisters visited amsterdam in mid-november 2008 .
one of the duisburg victims was a chief suspect in the december 2006 murder in san luca , calabria , of maria strangio , the wife of the suspected leader of the strangio-nirta clan and cousin of giovanni strangio .
the duisburg hit was believed to have been revenge for the christmas-time killing of maria strangio and the wounding of her son .
giovanni strangio ran two pizzerias in kaarst , germany , 30 kilometers south of duisburg , and was believed to be active in the nirta-strangio clan .

" doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements .

gez has been hard on the case of a german mathematician who died 450 years ago , residents at his former address said wednesday . the gez office sent adam ries , who recently would have turned 517 years old , a letter demanding that he pay long-overdue television license fees .
while its true that ries , an algebra expert , had bought the house in 1525 , he 's obviously not lounging around his living room watching a lot of television these days . a club in ries ' honor now stands on the site of his former house .

muench said she returned the letter to the gez with a note explaining that a man who had died over four centuries ago could n't possibly pay broadcasting fees .
or even have owned a television during his lifetime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.03.2009 german police doubt teenage gunman posted internet warning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german schools have been put on alert for copy-cat attacks police say a the alleged chatroom warning from the teenager who killed 15 people in a shooting rampage could be fake , while four hoaxers have been arrested across europe for threatening posts on the internet . a spokesman for waiblingen police said there was no record on the winnenden youth 's computer that he had logged into the chat forum on the eve of the albertville school massacre , but were questioning witnesses who reported seeing the entry to clarify if and when such a threat was made . " doubts emerged during the afternoon about the veracity of the entry in the internet chat room .
of course every piece of information , especially concerning this entry , is being vigorously examined , " police said in a statement . the chat room www.krautchan.net , which tim k. had allegedly used , posted a statement denying the claim .
the web site said that the press had been " unfortunately fooled ... by a forgery . " " no killing spree was announced here , " it said .
" maybe he visited the site , but he definitely did n't write the post that went through the news , because that one never existed . " german authorities are now working with the us internet company that hosts the online forum 's servers to find out whether the gunman actually posted the threat . on thursday , heribert rech , the interior minister of baden-wuerttemberg , announced at a press conference that the teenage gunman had given a clear warning about his deadly intentions in comments posted in a chatroom . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heribert rech moved to clarify his earlier statements " i 've had enough , " rech quoted from the chatroom message .
" always the same .
everybody 's laughing at me .
no one sees my potential .
i 'm serious .
i have weapons and i will go to my former school in the morning and have a proper barbecue .
maybe i 'll get away .
listen out .
you will hear of me tomorrow .
remember the place 's name : winnenden . " rech said tim k 's interview partner had not taken the threat seriously at first but he told his father about it after seeing reports of the shootings . in a newspaper interview on friday , rech moved to clarify his position on the statements . " some crazy person obviously put out this dreadful false message , " rech was quoted as saying .
" it must have been made up afterwards . " " i always made clear that i was referring to preliminary findings of the investigation .
it must now be cleared up how the father of a 17-year-old could claim to have seen the entry , " rech said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a screen shot from the alleged forum posting by tim k. less than seven hours after the alleged conversation , at around 09:30 cet , the teenage gunman entered the albertville school , armed with a handgun taken from his father 's bedroom and more than 200 rounds of ammunition . he fired 60 bullets at the school , killing eight girls , one boy and three female teachers , mostly with shots to the head .
he then fled , hijacked a car and randomly shot dead three bystanders . three hours later he was dead after a manhunt ended in a police shootout 30 kilometers -lrb- 20 miles -rrb- away .
state police chief erwin hetger said it was believed he had turned the gun on himself .
later thursday , a grainy amateur mobile phone video , apparently showing the killer 's dramatic last moments and death , surfaced on the internet . the two-minute clip shows a figure wielding a gun in a car park as shots ring out around him .
he then suddenly falls to the ground and seconds later is surrounded by dozens of police officers in green uniforms . hoaxers arrested across europe in the wake of the horrific events in the small town , a total of four people have been arrested for allegedly posting internet warnings of school shootings . german police in lower saxony said they arrested a 21-year-old man who boasted plans to carry out a similar crime in a chatroom . " i have a gun and i 'm going to kill everybody , " read the message .
the man , who claims the message was " a joke , " faces up to three year in jail or a fine . french police arrested an 18-year-old after he also posted a similar threat on a web site .
" in raincy -lrb- high school -rrb- there will be blood - i have weapons " the message read . dutch police also nabbed an 18-year-old for a similar warning and on thursday swedish police took a 17-year-old in for questioning for allegedly posting a picture of himself posing with a weapon on an internet forum , along with a threatening message against a high school . gunman was treated for depression as hundreds of people attended a church service for victims of the school massacre on thursday , more details of the gunman 's life began to emerge . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. was said to be a loner his father is a successful businessman who employs 150 people at a packaging firm , according to police , but his son found it difficult to fit in at school and had few friends . " he was simply not accepted by anyone and just sat all day in front of his computer , " mario , a schoolmate , told german television station n24 . reports also said he was keen on computer shooting games - especially the violent " counter-strike " - and had become a real-life crack shot at the shooting range where his father was a member . after leaving school last year , tim k. enrolled on a course to train as a salesman .
he regularly worked out at the gym , belonged to a sports club and was a keen table tennis player . after ending his studies last year , tim k. spent time in hospital undergoing treatment for depression .
he was supposed to continue his treatment at a psychiatric clinic adjacent to the school but broke off the therapy , officials said . guns appeared to be part of his life .
his father owned more than a dozen weapons , all locked away except the nine millimeter beretta pistol that he used in the shootings .
police also found 4,600 rounds of ammunition at the house . officials said tim k. had apparently cracked an eight-digit code to a locked cabinet containing guns and ammunition . police said the father might have to face charges of involuntary manslaughter because he had failed to lock up the weapon .
the parents , who also have a 15-year-old daughter , moved out of the family home on wednesday to escape media attention . the albertville school remained closed as psychologists provided counseling to traumatized students and teachers as well as the families of the victims . fears of copy-cat killings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the albertville attack , six other schools were on alert officials said there had been threats to six other schools in baden-wuerttemberg after wednesday 's shooting , prompting police to increase surveillance of school buildings . the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper echoed fears that the tragedy was almost certain to inspire others to emulate it .
" the images of the rampage encourage politicians to voice their outrage , shock and how dumbfounded they are .
it encourages the police to fine tune their video simulations and role-playing for such massacres , " the paper wrote .
“ why should n't the images of these massacres encourage all kinds of people but not the next person set to cause another massacre ? ”
the shooting was germany 's worst school massacre since april 2002 , when a 19-year-old high school student went on a rampage in erfurt , killing 12 teachers , two students , a school secretary and a policeman before killing himself . it has also renewed the debate on whether germany should tighten its gun control laws and install metal detectors at schools . media call for heightened school security german interior minister wolfgang schaeuble told reuters he saw no need to tighten gun controls further after the shooting .
" we should n't think about tougher laws all the time , but think about what we can change in society , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble called for a change in german society the sueddeutsche zeitung argued that stricter gun laws would n't prevent similar tragedies , but suggested that increased checks on current gun owners would be a good place to start .
" even owning a weapon is tied to several obligations , " the paper wrote .
" the father of the deadly shooter did not fulfill these and therefore he 'll have to be held accountable . "
conservative broadsheet die welt called for security to be increased in germany 's schools .
" at every airport and at many companies we are subject to search , but anyone can enter a german classroom unchecked . " it added that the nation much look at what motivated tim k. in order to keep similar outrages from happening again .
" prevention focused on perpetrators must be broadly expanded so as to see early warning signals , " the paper commented .
der tagesspiegel claimed the teenage gunman was a product of his environment and german society , which failed to offer him the support and help he needed to deal with his inner turmoil .
" the school , his friends and his parents , did n't offer him this chance , which is every child 's right .
now , as the culprit will have calculated , he is taken seriously .
the price to pay for a failure like this is unacceptable , " the paper wrote . ls / nda / afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

chapel members from carmarthen want the assembly government and mod to consider opening units at wrexham and llandeilo .
they said having to travel to visit was an " added burden " for families .
an mod spokesperson said it would not be in the best interests of casualties to treat them in hospitals without the necessary expertise .
delegates representing 3,000 independent chapel members in west carmarthen unanimously accepted the proposal urging the setting up of the two centres .
they suggested locating one unit near wrexham , where the royal welsh regiment is based , and the other at golden grove mansion near llandeilo , which they said would not be far from both glangwili hospital in carmarthen and the specialist burns unit at morriston hospital , swansea . "
our operational casualties deserve the best care " mod spokesperson in the motion , they said they " deplore the lack of provision in wales to treat soldiers " wounded in iraq and afghanistan .
the chapel said although the three regiments - the royal welsh , the welsh guards , and the queen 's dragoon guards - recruit heavily in wales , none of the mod 's 33 uk medical units are in the country .
they added that they believed the mod has " duty to provide treatment facilities in wales , for the sake of the soldiers and their families " .
the chapel members also said the units would " lighten the additional load " placed on the nhs of having to treat wounded military personnel , and would create new jobs in a period of severe economic problems .
the proposal will be passed onto the union of welsh independents for consideration at its annual meeting later this year .
actual numbers in response , a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " the health minister is concerned to ensure that returning military personnel are given the best possible care and keeps these matters under constant review . "
an mod spokesperson said : " our operational casualties deserve the best care .
" the royal centre for defence medicine at selly oak hospital in birmingham , where our injured personnel are treated on return from operations , is at the leading edge in the treatment of the most common types of injuries our casualties sustain .
" but the actual numbers of such patients are thankfully small , and it would not be in their best interests to place them in hospitals which do not have and could not sustain selly oak 's expertise in dealing with the types of injuries our personnel sustain on operations . "

delegates representing 3,000 independent chapel members in west carmarthen unanimously accepted the proposal urging the setting up of the two centres .
they suggested locating one unit near wrexham , where the royal welsh regiment is based , and the other at golden grove mansion near llandeilo , which they said would not be far from both glangwili hospital in carmarthen and the specialist burns unit at morriston hospital , swansea .
our operational casualties deserve the best care mod spokesperson in the motion , they said they " deplore the lack of provision in wales to treat soldiers " wounded in iraq and afghanistan .
the chapel said although the three regiments - the royal welsh , the welsh guards , and the queen 's dragoon guards - recruit heavily in wales , none of the mod 's 33 uk medical units are in the country .
they added that they believed the mod has " duty to provide treatment facilities in wales , for the sake of the soldiers and their families " .
the chapel members also said the units would " lighten the additional load " placed on the nhs of having to treat wounded military personnel , and would create new jobs in a period of severe economic problems .
the proposal will be passed onto the union of welsh independents for consideration at its annual meeting later this year .
actual numbers in response , a welsh assembly government spokesperson said : " the health minister is concerned to ensure that returning military personnel are given the best possible care and keeps these matters under constant review . "
an mod spokesperson said : " our operational casualties deserve the best care .
" the royal centre for defence medicine at selly oak hospital in birmingham , where our injured personnel are treated on return from operations , is at the leading edge in the treatment of the most common types of injuries our casualties sustain .
" but the actual numbers of such patients are thankfully small , and it would not be in their best interests to place them in hospitals which do not have and could not sustain selly oak 's expertise in dealing with the types of injuries our personnel sustain on operations . "

members of the rail maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union walked out for 24 hours at midnight , claiming workers are being pressured to work on sundays .
the rmt said london midland , which runs trains between london euston and birmingham , has forced managers to cover for conductors on sundays .
london midland rejected the union 's claim it was bullying managers .
the rail firm said there is a reduced timetable with passengers travelling from euston to crewe or birmingham new street , having to change at northampton .

the rmt 's general secretary bob crow accused the company of refusing to honour long-standing agreements that former silverlink staff could opt out of working on sundays and said the dispute had dragged on for eight years .
" instead of negotiating sensibly the company seems hell-bent on confrontation and is even intimidating reluctant managers into covering the conductors ' safety critical work .
" we believe that is reckless , because it takes three months to train conductors , who must have specialist route knowledge and keep abreast of developments in safety procedures , and these managers have received only a few days ' hastily-arranged refresher course . "
safety ' not compromised ' the rmt plans to stage another 24-hour strike next monday .
london midland said : " the reason for the dispute is arrangements for sunday working and calculation of rest-day payments .

the company rejected the rmt 's allegations it was " bullying " managers and said safety was not being compromised .
the transport salaried staffs association -lrb- tssa -rrb- said it was balloting 30 managers at the company over claims of " undue pressure " to cover for conductors .

members of the rail maritime and transport -lrb- rmt -rrb- union walked out for 24 hours at midnight , claiming workers are being pressured to work on sundays .
the rmt said london midland , which runs trains between london euston and birmingham , has forced managers to cover for conductors on sundays .
london midland rejected the union 's claim it was bullying managers .
the rail firm said there is a reduced timetable with passengers travelling from euston to crewe or birmingham new street , having to change at northampton .
all other london midland services through crewe and birmingham new street are unaffected .
instead of negotiating sensibly the company seems hell-bent on confrontation rmt general secretary bob crow there is also a reduced service between london euston , tring , milton keynes and the lines between bletchley and bedford , and between watford junction and st albans abbey .
the rmt 's general secretary bob crow accused the company of refusing to honour long-standing agreements that former silverlink staff could opt out of working on sundays and said the dispute had dragged on for eight years .
" instead of negotiating sensibly the company seems hell-bent on confrontation and is even intimidating reluctant managers into covering the conductors ' safety critical work .
" we believe that is reckless , because it takes three months to train conductors , who must have specialist route knowledge and keep abreast of developments in safety procedures , and these managers have received only a few days ' hastily-arranged refresher course . "
safety ' not compromised ' the rmt plans to stage another 24-hour strike next monday .
london midland said : " the reason for the dispute is arrangements for sunday working and calculation of rest-day payments .
" both of these issues pre-date the start of london midland 's franchise .
" the company has offered to change the calculation and backdate this to the start of the franchise -lrb- 11 november 2007 -rrb- . "
the company rejected the rmt 's allegations it was " bullying " managers and said safety was not being compromised .

in a message to the us congress , mr obama said iran was acting contrary to us interests in the region .
the sanctions , which ban us companies from investing or trading with iran , have been renewed annually since 1995 .
the us fears iran 's nuclear programme is a cover to build atomic weapons , a charge iranian officials deny .
enriched uranium can be used in nuclear power plants , but can also be used to make atomic weapons .
' extended hand ' although the obama administration is reviewing its policy towards iran , not extending the sanctions would have constituted a major break with the past , says bbc state department correspondent kim ghattas in washington .
the actions and policies of the government of iran are contrary to the interests of the united states in the region barack obama obama diary : the first 100 days iran faces other punishing international measures , including three sets of un sanctions , over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
the us sanctions against iran would have lapsed without mr obama 's formal notice of renewal .
" the actions and policies of the government of iran are contrary to the interests of the united states in the region and pose a continuing and unusual and extraordinary threat , " mr obama 's message to congress said .
mr obama has talked of engagement with iran but has not made clear how that might take place .
shortly after coming to office in january , mr obama said " if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fists , they will find an extended hand from us " .

in a message to the us congress , mr obama said iran was acting contrary to us interests in the region .
the sanctions , which ban us companies from investing or trading with iran , have been renewed annually since 1995 .
the us fears iran 's nuclear programme is a cover to build atomic weapons , a charge iranian officials deny .
enriched uranium can be used in nuclear power plants , but can also be used to make atomic weapons .
' extended hand ' although the obama administration is reviewing its policy towards iran , not extending the sanctions would have constituted a major break with the past , says bbc state department correspondent kim ghattas in washington .
the actions and policies of the government of iran are contrary to the interests of the united states in the region barack obama obama diary : the first 100 days iran faces other punishing international measures , including three sets of un sanctions , over its refusal to freeze its uranium enrichment activities .
the us sanctions against iran would have lapsed without mr obama 's formal notice of renewal .
" the actions and policies of the government of iran are contrary to the interests of the united states in the region and pose a continuing and unusual and extraordinary threat , " mr obama 's message to congress said .
mr obama has talked of engagement with iran but has not made clear how that might take place .
shortly after coming to office in january , mr obama said " if countries like iran are willing to unclench their fists , they will find an extended hand from us " .

like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new pubs - were up 1.9 % in the six months to 25 january , while total sales climbed 6.5 % to £ 468.7m.
sales during the period were helped by a promotion which saw the cost of a pint of beer reduced to 99p .
pre-tax profits for the six month period before exceptional items were up 2 % to £ 30.8m.
however , after one-off costs relating to the disposal of properties and legal fees , pre-tax profits were down 10.2 % to £ 25.6m.
" although the pub industry as a whole is under great pressure from higher taxes and social legislation , as well as a difficult economy , as a result of our strong cashflow , reducing debt and the excellent work of our employees , i remain confident of the company 's future prospects , " said wetherspoon chairman tim martin .
the company said that in the six weeks to 8 march , its sales had continued to grow , with like-for-like sales up 1.9 % and total sales 5.6 % higher .
it confirmed that it would not be paying a dividend .
in january it had said it would be cancelling future dividend payments and would use the money to cut its debts .
tax warning mr martin hit out at the tax burden facing the pub industry , saying the costs of taxes and regulations had " gone too far " .
" the government seems not to understand the economic impact of new taxes and legislation and continues to impose new burdens at a huge rate , " he said .
wetherspoon said that its average pub made a £ 50,000 profit after tax , while it generated taxes of about £ 530,000 .
" britain has now become a highly taxed economy , with high and increasing employment costs , which will have predictable and inevitable effects on employment levels and tax income in the near and medium term , " mr martin said .

wetherspoon chairman tim martin on selling 99p beer pub operator jd wetherspoon says it has had a " successful " half year after reporting a rise in sales .
like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of new pubs - were up 1.9 % in the six months to 25 january , while total sales climbed 6.5 % to £ 468.7m.
sales during the period were helped by a promotion which saw the cost of a pint of beer reduced to 99p .
pre-tax profits for the six month period before exceptional items were up 2 % to £ 30.8m.
however , after one-off costs relating to the disposal of properties and legal fees , pre-tax profits were down 10.2 % to £ 25.6m.
" although the pub industry as a whole is under great pressure from higher taxes and social legislation , as well as a difficult economy , as a result of our strong cashflow , reducing debt and the excellent work of our employees , i remain confident of the company 's future prospects , " said wetherspoon chairman tim martin .
the company said that in the six weeks to 8 march , its sales had continued to grow , with like-for-like sales up 1.9 % and total sales 5.6 % higher .
it confirmed that it would not be paying a dividend .
in january it had said it would be cancelling future dividend payments and would use the money to cut its debts .
tax warning mr martin hit out at the tax burden facing the pub industry , saying the costs of taxes and regulations had " gone too far " .
" the government seems not to understand the economic impact of new taxes and legislation and continues to impose new burdens at a huge rate , " he said .
wetherspoon said that its average pub made a £ 50,000 profit after tax , while it generated taxes of about £ 530,000 .
" britain has now become a highly taxed economy , with high and increasing employment costs , which will have predictable and inevitable effects on employment levels and tax income in the near and medium term , " mr martin said .

janet beach , from tonyrefail , rhondda cynon taf , paid for her daughter emily , 21 , who has had anorexia for six years to get help .
bethan jenkins am said it was " not acceptable " that people with eating disorders had to go abroad for help .
the assembly government has announced money for more community services .
mrs beach 's daughter emily had written a letter directly to the health authorities in which she pleaded for help .
in it she said : " i knew from the past six years with my constant relapses and lack of professional help that unless i get intense treatment now , i will be in the same predicament in another six years , or dead . "
her mother used money from her savings to pay for emily to have residential care in south africa .
she told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme : " to see her going through the gates at heathrow airport and travelling all that way on her own and knowing what she was going to have to do when she got there . "
she lost her hair , she had osteoporosis , her eyesight was affected - just all of her god love her , she was just in a terrible state " sian dalton on her daughter lisa " fortunately we had that money that we could use - a lot of people wo n't have that . "
emily is expected to return from south africa on saturday .
mrs beach said she is " excited " about her return , but she is still concerned about the lack of specialist services to treat eating disorders in wales .
she said there are no specialist dieticians locally and they will have to pay £ 90 an hour to see one privately .
sian dalton from bridgend also criticised the lack of specialist services in wales .
her daughter lisa died in november .
she had suffered from anorexia from the age of 10 .
" she lost her hair , she had osteoporosis , her eyesight was affected - just all of her god love her , she was just in a terrible state , " she said .
mrs dalton says there were not sufficient services to support her daughter .
" from july 2007 to the 21st dec 2007 my daughter was seen 20 times plus by medical staff and i was telling them that lisa 's weight was dropping at an alarming rate - eating two plums a day , frogmarching four or five miles and still she was at home in this environment and nothing was done and by which time she dropped nearly five stone in weight , " she said .
dr dee dawson , medical director at the rhodes farm clinic , in north london , which helps children with anorexia and bulimia , said she did not think eating disorders were taken seriously in wales .
" i think the nhs is well aware that the specialised units where you have dieticians , therapists , doctors and nurses coming together and working as a team , you certainly get the best results , " she said .
" lisa dalton could not even find a therapist and she desperately needed someone to talk to .
" i do n't really know why wales does n't organise anything .
one of my consultants who worked in rhodes farm for four years left about three years ago to work in swansea .
so you have an eating disorders expert there who is not even being used . "
south wales west am , bethan jenkins , who founded the assembly 's cross party group on eating disorders , said : " i think this is an issue that 's been on the backburner for far too long .
" we ca n't be waiting around even more for people to die and to have to go to other countries for treatment . "
health minister edwina hart has said she wants more services available in the community - and has allocated £ 1m a year to pay for these services .
she also plans to introduce new guidance for the health service to intervene earlier when eating disorders are diagnosed .
a spokesman for the assembly government said there was a £ 6.5m fund for school based counselling as well as plans to improve the mental health services for young people .
he said purpose built units would be built at bridgend and abergele .
" the health minister , edwina hart , is determined to enhance the levels of community-based provision in wales , " he added .
" in october 2008 , the minister announced additional funding of £ 0.5 m in 09/10 with £ 1m recurrent thereafter .
" this funding will enable earlier treatment of those suffering from eating disorders so their needs can be met as quickly as possible and lower the risk of their condition worsening to such a state where they require inpatient care . "
