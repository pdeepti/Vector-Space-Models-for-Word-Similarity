at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 eurovision song contest eurovision song contest celebrates 54 years of musical hilarity germany sends eurovision star lena into orbit topless video adds heat to eurovision run-up in germany norway sweeps eurovision song contest music -pipe- 15.05.2009 eurovision rocked by series of controversies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's hadise is among the bookies ' favorites the famous annual kitsch-fest that is the eurovision song contest is to take place in the russian capital on saturday .
there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

car dealers in europe seek a minority stake in opel as fiat and canadian parts maker magna prepare rival takeover bid for the struggling automaker . car dealers at general motors ' opel unit have announced plans to buy a stake in the struggling automaker , investing up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- .
representatives from 25 countries of the european opel dealer association met in vienna on friday to endorse the plan .
in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

temporary trustee scheme meanwhile state premiers in four german states where opel have production plants have endorsed a proposal by the german government to set up a trustee ownership scheme to temporarily take over german carmaker opel if its us parent general motors files for bankruptcy .
the move , which gm says would require state guarantees worth more than one billion euros , would give opel more time to find a suitable partner for the future .
more than 25,000 people are employed by opel in germany at ruesselsheim , bochum , kaiserslautern and eisenach .

but according to german newspapers financial times deutschland and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung there is opposition from the obama administration to the temporary trustee scheme , presenting europe 's car dealers with another headache as they seek to overcome a drop in sales .
with a june 1 deadline imposed by the obama administration to restructure its operations and pay off debts to its creditors looming , the future for dealers at opel 's american parent general motors looks bleak .
on friday gm announced massive cuts in its dealership network , terminating the contracts of 1,100 of its 6,000 dealers. nrt / reuters / ap / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .

friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .

the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .

the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "

unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.05.2009 german agriculture minister talks gm corn in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is working hard to defend its decision to ban genetically modified corn in washington , germany 's agriculture and consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , has had a tough time explaining that her decision to ban a strain of us corn is not old fashioned protectionism . aigner has been kept busy defending germany 's decision to ban the planting or sale of the seeds of mon810 , a genetically modified strain of maize .
the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.05.2009 germany 's economy experiences biggest contraction in 39 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tumbling exports largely contributed to the drop in gdp the global recession has dealt the german economy its biggest blow in nearly four decades as the world-wide slump wipes 3.8 percent from national output in the first quarter of this year . this is the fourth quarter in a row of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , which is the basic measure of an economy 's economic performance .
in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .

the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .

the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .

a commission spokesman said on friday the move " does not raise any competition concerns , " choosing not to set any conditions on the planned takeover .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has provided 102 billion euros -lrb- 135 billion dollars -rrb- to help hre avoid financial collapse in the wake of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
hre posted a loss of nearly 5.5 billion euros last year , but the bank 's biggest shareholder , us investment fund j.c. flowers , rejects the government 's move to nationalize the financial institution , threatening to take the case to germany 's constitutional court .
in the meantime , the german government announced it had increased its ownership of hre to just under 50 percent , with further plans to raise its stake to 90 percent control of the financial institution .
berlin 's push to tighten its grip on hre comes ahead of an extraordinary stockholders ' meeting later this month .
meanwhile munich prosecutors are investigating legal suits filed by two lawyers who claim that hypo real estate delayed filing a petition in insolvency .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.05.2009 german agriculture minister talks gm corn in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is working hard to defend its decision to ban genetically modified corn in washington , germany 's agriculture and consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , has had a tough time explaining that her decision to ban a strain of us corn is not old fashioned protectionism . aigner has been kept busy defending germany 's decision to ban the planting or sale of the seeds of mon810 , a genetically modified strain of maize .
the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "

" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .

friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : 2010 eurovision song contest eurovision song contest celebrates 54 years of musical hilarity germany sends eurovision star lena into orbit topless video adds heat to eurovision run-up in germany norway sweeps eurovision song contest music -pipe- 15.05.2009 eurovision rocked by series of controversies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's hadise is among the bookies ' favorites the famous annual kitsch-fest that is the eurovision song contest is to take place in the russian capital on saturday .
there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.05.2009 german agriculture minister talks gm corn in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is working hard to defend its decision to ban genetically modified corn in washington , germany 's agriculture and consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , has had a tough time explaining that her decision to ban a strain of us corn is not old fashioned protectionism . aigner has been kept busy defending germany 's decision to ban the planting or sale of the seeds of mon810 , a genetically modified strain of maize .
the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .

the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .

friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 15.05.2009 german agriculture minister talks gm corn in washington großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is working hard to defend its decision to ban genetically modified corn in washington , germany 's agriculture and consumer protection minister , ilse aigner , has had a tough time explaining that her decision to ban a strain of us corn is not old fashioned protectionism . aigner has been kept busy defending germany 's decision to ban the planting or sale of the seeds of mon810 , a genetically modified strain of maize .
the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

the move , which gm says would require state guarantees worth more than one billion euros , would give opel more time to find a suitable partner for the future .
more than 25,000 people are employed by opel in germany at ruesselsheim , bochum , kaiserslautern and eisenach .

but according to german newspapers financial times deutschland and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung there is opposition from the obama administration to the temporary trustee scheme , presenting europe 's car dealers with another headache as they seek to overcome a drop in sales .
with a june 1 deadline imposed by the obama administration to restructure its operations and pay off debts to its creditors looming , the future for dealers at opel 's american parent general motors looks bleak .

under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a commission spokesman said on friday the move " does not raise any competition concerns , " choosing not to set any conditions on the planned takeover .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has provided 102 billion euros -lrb- 135 billion dollars -rrb- to help hre avoid financial collapse in the wake of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
hre posted a loss of nearly 5.5 billion euros last year , but the bank 's biggest shareholder , us investment fund j.c. flowers , rejects the government 's move to nationalize the financial institution , threatening to take the case to germany 's constitutional court .
in the meantime , the german government announced it had increased its ownership of hre to just under 50 percent , with further plans to raise its stake to 90 percent control of the financial institution .
berlin 's push to tighten its grip on hre comes ahead of an extraordinary stockholders ' meeting later this month .

representatives from 25 countries of the european opel dealer association met in vienna on friday to endorse the plan .
in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a commission spokesman said on friday the move " does not raise any competition concerns , " choosing not to set any conditions on the planned takeover .
chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government has provided 102 billion euros -lrb- 135 billion dollars -rrb- to help hre avoid financial collapse in the wake of the us subprime mortgage crisis .
hre posted a loss of nearly 5.5 billion euros last year , but the bank 's biggest shareholder , us investment fund j.c. flowers , rejects the government 's move to nationalize the financial institution , threatening to take the case to germany 's constitutional court .
in the meantime , the german government announced it had increased its ownership of hre to just under 50 percent , with further plans to raise its stake to 90 percent control of the financial institution .

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .

" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .

koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .

in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

temporary trustee scheme meanwhile state premiers in four german states where opel have production plants have endorsed a proposal by the german government to set up a trustee ownership scheme to temporarily take over german carmaker opel if its us parent general motors files for bankruptcy .
the move , which gm says would require state guarantees worth more than one billion euros , would give opel more time to find a suitable partner for the future .
more than 25,000 people are employed by opel in germany at ruesselsheim , bochum , kaiserslautern and eisenach .

but according to german newspapers financial times deutschland and frankfurter allgemeine zeitung there is opposition from the obama administration to the temporary trustee scheme , presenting europe 's car dealers with another headache as they seek to overcome a drop in sales .
with a june 1 deadline imposed by the obama administration to restructure its operations and pay off debts to its creditors looming , the future for dealers at opel 's american parent general motors looks bleak .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .

" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .

friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .

the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .

car dealers in europe seek a minority stake in opel as fiat and canadian parts maker magna prepare rival takeover bid for the struggling automaker . car dealers at general motors ' opel unit have announced plans to buy a stake in the struggling automaker , investing up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- .
representatives from 25 countries of the european opel dealer association met in vienna on friday to endorse the plan .
in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

temporary trustee scheme meanwhile state premiers in four german states where opel have production plants have endorsed a proposal by the german government to set up a trustee ownership scheme to temporarily take over german carmaker opel if its us parent general motors files for bankruptcy .
the move , which gm says would require state guarantees worth more than one billion euros , would give opel more time to find a suitable partner for the future .
more than 25,000 people are employed by opel in germany at ruesselsheim , bochum , kaiserslautern and eisenach .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .

" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .

friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.05.2009 germany 's economy experiences biggest contraction in 39 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tumbling exports largely contributed to the drop in gdp the global recession has dealt the german economy its biggest blow in nearly four decades as the world-wide slump wipes 3.8 percent from national output in the first quarter of this year . this is the fourth quarter in a row of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , which is the basic measure of an economy 's economic performance .
in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .
he insists that , particularly now , metro should not turn away from the supplier .
" it is certainly wrong to end the collaboration .
metro needs to take responsibility , must try to repair the damage and should work together with the supplier in bangladesh to ensure that such labour law violations do not take place in future . "
metro will analyse the whole incident by the end of may and will then take further action - possibly also within the company .

at its annual shareholders ' meeting this week , chief executive eckhard cordes expressed deep regret over the incident and announced that the company had ended collaboration with the supplier with immediate effect . fatema akter died during her shift in a garment factory in the port city of chittagong in december last year .
rights activists say the 18 year old woman was forced to work 13 to 15 hours a day and without holidays .
the us-based national labour committee released a report this week , which says fatema was sick and exhausted on the day she died .
when she asked to be allowed to go home , her supervisor slapped her and forced her to continue working , the report added .
the committee also said that fatema ’ s case was not an isolated incident .
overwork is common at the factory and workers are often abused and beaten by their superiors .
nearly 80 percent of the garments produced at this particular factory were supplied to the german retail giant metro group .
no follow-up inquiry eckhard cordes , the ceo of the düsseldorf-based firm admitted this week at a shareholder meeting that there had been problems with the bangladeshi supplier in the past too .
“ the supplier in bangladesh did not work according to our high and mandatory social standards .
this was shown in an independent inquiry in 2005 , ” said cordes .
following the investigation , the supplier was asked to rectify the problems immediately .
the company , as per its own policy , was due to re-investigate the matter a year later in 2006 .
but the follow-up did not take place , admitted cordes to his shareholders : " our internal inquiry shows it was a simple case of human error within the firm .
the follow-up inquiry simply did not happen . "
‘ inadequate ’ action metro has now taken action .
it has terminated its contract with the garment supplier and the products , already made , have been removed from its collection .
it has also announced that an in-house commission will investigate the circumstances surrounding the death of the young bangladeshi woman .
however maik pflaum , one of a group of critical shareholder activists , says metro 's measures are inadequate .

it is made up of federal parliamentarians and delegates from germany 's 16 states . the president is elected for a five-year term , and may only be re-elected once . the presidential job is largely ceremonial .
the president has a symbolic function and wields limited powers , but does have moral authority .
past presidents have played an important role in national life by opening debates on broad ethical and social issues . presidential duties include representing germany in its international relations and concluding treaties with other states on its behalf ; appointing and dismissing federal judges , federal civil servants and commissioned and non-commissioned officers of the bundeswehr , germany 's armed forces ; pardoning convicted criminals ; proposing to the bundestag a candidate for the office of german chancellor ; and appointing and dismissing federal ministers . it 's germany 's highest office , and the only one where the incumbent gets to live in their own palace – bellevue palace in berlin .
the president is officially the most important person in the country . what the president does n't have is the power to make political decisions .
but the president can exert some influence on the chancellor and the government by prompting debate and guiding the direction it takes . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour dw-world.de check out our latest interactive web features dw screensaver social bookmarking our rss feeds dw widgets integrated search dw on facebook newsletters netvibes.com the way you want it mobile optimized for pdas newsletters news in your inbox audio / video podcasts © dw 2010 deutsche welle is not responsible for the content of external websites .

the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnia and hercegovina 's eurovision entry , bistra voda given its sprawling scale , it is hardly a surprise . along with the countries that automatically qualify for the contest , a record number of 43 countries have been represented in the knock-out rounds for the 54th eurovision song contest this year .
artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv . " unfortunately legoland is not eligible to participate because it does not have a public service broadcaster which belongs to the ebu , " he said . as the russian daily kommersant noted , " the scandals are louder than the songs .

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

car dealers in europe seek a minority stake in opel as fiat and canadian parts maker magna prepare rival takeover bid for the struggling automaker . car dealers at general motors ' opel unit have announced plans to buy a stake in the struggling automaker , investing up to 500 million euros -lrb- $ 680 million -rrb- .
representatives from 25 countries of the european opel dealer association met in vienna on friday to endorse the plan .
in return the euroda dealer group want a 10-15 percent stake in the german subsidiary and a seat on the supervisory board .
under the scheme dealers at germany 's opel and britain 's vauxhall would pay 150 euros into a fund for each vehicle sold over the next three years .
" we demand a fair equity share in the new company , representation in the supervisory board , and obviously , a fair financial return on our investment , " said euroda chairman jaap timmer .
timmer admitted asking retailers to pay into the fund would hurt them , especially those in central and eastern europe , " but it would be far worse if we had no manufacturer at all . "

temporary trustee scheme meanwhile state premiers in four german states where opel have production plants have endorsed a proposal by the german government to set up a trustee ownership scheme to temporarily take over german carmaker opel if its us parent general motors files for bankruptcy .
the move , which gm says would require state guarantees worth more than one billion euros , would give opel more time to find a suitable partner for the future .
more than 25,000 people are employed by opel in germany at ruesselsheim , bochum , kaiserslautern and eisenach .

the maize , one of the oldest gm strains being cultivated , is extra resistant to crop destroying insects , but it has already raised concerns in several european union countries that it might be damaging to the environment .
now it appears it may be damaging trans-atlantic relations as well .
on her first trip to the united states , aigner said talks with the us trade representative , ron kirk , and the chairman of the us committee on agriculture , collin peterson , had been constructive and that the us understood her standpoint , even if they did n't like it .
“ the decision was n't well received , " aigner said , " i think they saw this as a purely protectionist move . "
aigner reiterated her argument that germany 's position on mon810 has nothing to do with market protectionism .
she said that recent studies showed that mon810 produced a substance toxic to predators , but also to other insects , and that the plant 's pollen spread more widely than originally thought .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm corn in mecklenburg- western pommerania state in eastern germany .
a german court said the government had presented enough evidence that the maize posed a risk , as laid out in genetic technology law to uphold the government 's position .
it said berlin did not have to provide definitive scientific proof of a danger to the environment to justify outlawing the crop .
monsanto argues that the safety of mon810 has been demonstrated by the united states , japan , canada and the european commission .
some critics have said aigner 's decision is a political point-scoring exercise in an election year .
however barbara helfferich , an environmental officer with the european commission , said germany is within its rights to suspend the use of mon810 .
“ a country can invoke a safeguard clause if it has convincing new evidence that the product that is put on the market or planted poses a threat to the environment or the health of its citizens in the specificity of the context of the country , ” she said .
last month in prague , at an informal meeting of eu environment ministers , european environment commissioner stavros dimas said the eu would begin a review of germany 's decision to ban the genetically modified maize .
monsanto has called aigner 's policy “ capricious , ” and the company is seeking to suspend the ban via an appeal to a higher german court and says it will eventually seek its permanent reversal .
barbara helfferich of the european commission says that if monsanto 's bid fails , they will have to get their case heard by the highest authority , the world trade organisation .
“ the next step would be that monsanto would be asking the united states to go to the wto , " she said , " but that again is a question of european competence where we are following our own legislation and for the moment there is no reason to think that we are violating any of the wto rules . ”
germany is the sixth eu country to introduce a provisional ban on mon810 , following similar moves by france , austria , hungary , luxembourg and greece .
the european commission had sought to force austria and hungary to reverse their bans on the crop , but its ruling was overturned by a majority of eu nations in march. ch / dpa / afp / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

there 's been one controversy after another in the run-up to the event . it might have limped in last place at the contest in belgrade last year , but germany is pulling out all the stops in 2009 with an entry called " miss kiss kiss bang ! " with a little help from burlesque dancer dita von teese . resorting to support from a world-famous stripper with no actual ties to germany is a fairly desperate measure - and the word on the street is that the country still does n't stand a chance . the favorites have already emerged .
these include turkish pop singer hadise , a beyonce look-alike whose act " dum tek tek " combines oriental rhythms and belly dancing , and a jewish-arab duo who go by the name of achinoam nini . as israel 's first mixed ethnic entry to the contest in decades , the jewish singer better known abroad as noa and mira awad , a christian arab israeli , will perform a tune called " there must be another way " . awad has faced accusations from within the arab community of turning her back on her palestinian heritage by representing israel alongside a jewish performer . friends and foes but controversies are par for the course at the annual event , which tends to highlight hostilities rather than harmonies between the contenders .

artists from 25 of them will now compete in the final . among those that have qualified to perform at the olimpiyski indoor arena this weekend are turkey , sweden , israel , portugal , malta , finland , bosnia and hercegovina , romania , armenia and iceland , after voting by television viewers and juries across europe . russian rumpus the event is to be held in moscow after dima bilan last year gave russia its first victory with a rock ballad called " believe . " but despite promising to stage the most lavish eurovision ever , russia has n't proved to be the most gracious of hosts . georgia , which fought a war against russia last august , pulled out of the competition after the governing body banned its song for containing political references , perceived as a thinly-veiled swipe at russian prime minister vladimir putin . meanwhile , russia 's own entry has been criticized by nationalists because the singer hails from ukraine , another country that has strained relations with moscow .
the choice was seen by many as " un-russian . " but the final straw came when russian gay pride events coinciding with the contest were banned by the moscow authorities .
gay rights groups insisted they would go ahead with a demonstration in central moscow on the day of the final in an effort to draw attention to the discrimination and violence they say the country 's gay people face . legoland excluded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : legoland is not a contender so much for russia 's problems - perhaps even more inflammatory is a decision taken by the european broadcasting union -lrb- ebu -rrb- , which organizes the event , not to accept an entry from legoland , despite a personal appeal by a man calling himself ' legoman ' who visited the ebu headquarters in geneva . a delegation purporting to represent legoland entered the geneva headquarters of the ebu , which organizes the popular annual contest , and asked to see the director of eurovision tv . " i am delighted that this year 's eurovision song contest is attracting such great interest , " said bjorn erichsen , director of eurovision tv .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.05.2009 germany 's economy experiences biggest contraction in 39 years großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's tumbling exports largely contributed to the drop in gdp the global recession has dealt the german economy its biggest blow in nearly four decades as the world-wide slump wipes 3.8 percent from national output in the first quarter of this year . this is the fourth quarter in a row of falling gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- , which is the basic measure of an economy 's economic performance .
in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .

" the message has been a consistent theme of the 82-year-old pontiff 's speeches during his historic week-long visit to the middle east . the german-born pope , who has faced criticism from some israeli leaders for what they said was a failure to sufficiently apologize for nazi atrocities against jews in world war ii , also strongly condemned the holocaust . he vowed that the brutal extermination of jews by the " godless " nazi regime would never be forgotten or denied . israeli president shimon peres called the pope 's visit a " profound demonstration of the enduring dialogue " between christians and jews . peres also made reference to the pope 's statement about the holocaust never being denied , saying it carried " substantive and special weight . "
" it touched our hearts and minds , " peres said .
" powerful impressions " the pope said his pilgrimage to the holy land , his first , had made " powerful impressions " of hope and sadness on him . he also called the fortified israeli barrier in and around the west bank " one of the saddest sights for me during my visit . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pope benedict met palestinian president mahmoud abbas earlier in the week " as i passed alongside it , i prayed for a future in which the peoples of the holy land can live together in peace and harmony without the need for such instruments of security and separation , " the pontiff said . the pope 's pilgrimage included a tour of a palestinian refugee camp in the west bank and meetings with both israeli and palestinian leaders . the pontiff 's many speeches during the tour have included several strong political statements , including his assertion of the rights of palestinians to a sovereign homeland . visit to christian holy site earlier on friday , the pope paid a visit to the church of the holy sepulchre in jerusalem , the site where jesus christ is believed to have been crucified . the pontiff was escorted by clergymen in gold-embroidered black robes and red fezzes who beat their staffs on the cobblestones as he made his way by foot through the narrow alleyways of the walled old city of jerusalem to the church .
the pope kissed a rectangular stone on which it is believed jesus ' body was placed after crucifixion before entering the church to pray at what christians believe is the empty tomb of jesus .
the pope also met with leaders from the greek orthodox church , saying that christians and all residents of jerusalem should have equal access to housing , employment and education .
the shrinking christian minority in israel and the palestinian areas , down to about two percent of the population , is of concern to the catholic church .
visit dogged by controversy but the pope 's week-long trip to the middle east , his first visit to the region as pontiff , has not been without controversy .
on tuesday , a row erupted over the pope 's membership as a teenager of the hitler youth , as he paid a historic visit to holy sites in jerusalem .
vatican spokesman federico lombardi said the pontiff had " never , never , never " belonged to the organization , but later changed his version , saying that he had been a member but his membership was compulsory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some israeli leaders criticized the pope 's speech at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in his own 1997 memoirs , pope benedict had said he had been registered with the hitler youth while he was at a seminary .
the controversy followed comments by some israeli leaders complaining that the pope did not go far enough in offering emotion in remarks he made on monday at the yad vashem memorial to the jewish dead of the holocaust . but in friday 's speech , the pope said the meeting with holocaust survivors at yad vashem in jerusalem was " one of the most solemn moments " of his pilgrimage . " those deeply moving encounters brought back memories of my visit three years ago to the death camp at auschwitz , where so many jews - mothers , fathers , husbands , wives , brothers , sisters , friends - were brutally exterminated under a godless regime , " he said . hf / spafp / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold hf / spafp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're meeting in the northern city of hanover to set the party 's platform ahead of a general election in september .
" we want to rule , " westerwelle told 660 delegates , making it clear he intended to return his pro-business party to government as a junior coalition partner after an 11-year absence .
in a combative speech that lasted nearly 90 minutes , the 47-year-old politician reaffirmed his party 's promises to cut taxes if elected .
" we are the only true representatives of the middle classes - all the others have moved to the left , " westerwelle said .
" tax cuts will help the economy more than subsidizing one sector after the other , " he said .
" we should relieve the burden on the middle class .
that is the best answer to the downturn . "
economy the main battlefield in election bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's largest economy has been buffeted by the global recession and the collapse of world trade germany , which relies heavily on its exports to power its economy , has been hit hard by the global economic downturn and the slump in global trade .
unemployment rose in april to 3.46 million people , or 8.3 percent of the workforce .
this week the country slashed its tax revenue estimates for 2009 by close to 50 billion euros .
on friday , new figures showed that the economy contracted by nearly four percent in the first quarter of 2009 .
given the dismal economic outlook , tax cuts and recipes to beat germany 's economic downturn are already shaping up to be the most contentious issues in the elections .
but angela merkel 's conservative christian democratic union remains deeply divided on the chancellor 's plans to promise german voters tax cuts from next year .
merkel 's grand coalition partner , the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , has vowed to fight the election with promises to raise the tax burden on the rich and relieve low earners .
merkel 's government has already spent billions on shoring up banks and is considering bailing out large firms including ailing carmaker opel and retailer arcandor .
westerwelle criticized the strategy , saying his party remained firmly opposed to the nationalization of companies and the differing treatment awarded to firms .
" if a big company goes bust , the german eagle flies in .
if a small company goes bust , the bankruptcy vultures arrive , " westerwelle said .
an opinion poll commissioned by public broadcaster ard this week showed the fdp down one point on 13 percent , the conservatives on 35 percent and spd on 28 percent .
westerwelle said merkel 's conservatives remained his desired coalition partner with the two parties broadly agreeing on many financial policies .
the fdp is already in coalitions with the conservatives in five german states governments. sp / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the last quarter , the economy shrank by 2.1 percent after two quarters of contracting by 0.5 percent .
the federal statistics office says this is the strongest contraction germany has seen since 1970 , when it began tracking quarter-to-quarter growth .
it is also the first time since reunification in 1990 that the german economy has experienced so many quarters of negative growth .
" this is a dramatic plunge , " juergen michels , an economist at banking group citigroup said .
" and a worse start to the year than we could have imagined . "
governments and investors hope the worst of the first global recession since world war ii may soon pass .
this latest news , however , has confirmed that the situation remains dire .
but some economists are still hopeful .
not all doom and gloom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a recession is generally defined as two consecutive quarters of negative growth - germany and the euro zone have now had four " it tells you that there was an unprecedented collapse in economic activity driven by the really unprecedented downward cycle of the global economy , which especially hurt industry , " said alexander koch , an economist from multinational lender unicredit .
" the latest ugly gdp figures should , however , mark the trough of the current ' great recession . "
koch said there have been reassuring reports for the coming months , " especially from business sentiment indicators and also the very surprising and very favourable strong rise in german new orders in march .
this clearly indicates that the pace of recession will strongly decelerate in spring . "
stefan muetze , an economist with helaba , a bank based in the german states of hessen and thuringia , said measures taken to fight the recession - such as state stimulus packages and the lowering of interest rates - could still reverse the downward trend sooner than expected .
" if demand begins to edge upwards , then company finances will begin to replenish , he says .
“ this will have a flow-on effect and we could start to see moderate growth in the second half of 2009 . ” germany drags down euro zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : output is down across the entire 27-nation european union germany accounts for about a third of the eurozone ’ s output , a big reason why the economy of the 16-nation bloc has also fallen into a deep slump - the worst since its records began in 1995 .
friday ’ s data showed the single-currency bloc contracted by 2.5 percent in this year ’ s first quarter and 4.6 percent over one year .
the first quarter contraction was much worse than many economists had predicted and marked the dramatic turn for the worse that the european economy experienced at the start of the year .
just a few days ago forecasts pointed to a decline of around 2 percent .
while germany saw the deepest slump , austria was not far behind with a drop of 2.8 percent and italy with its 2.4 percent contraction in the first quarter .
meanwhile , europe 's second largest economy , france , also saw negative growth , sliding by 1.2 percent .
the greater 27-nation european union saw its economy shrink by 2.5 percent .
while the economic meltdown may have originated in the united states , the eurozone contraction is now worse than in the us , where the economy shrank 1.6 percent in the first quarter .
after the figures were announced the euro fell sharply against the dollar. dfm / hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : nancy isenson / trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a lack of beds , escalating costs , poor communication and funding disputes in the service were blamed by the report .
the bbc 's dragon 's eye programme also claimed a bid for more assembly powers over mental health was being held up .
an assembly government spokesperson said it would consider responses to the study before deciding what to do .
the independent study was ordered by the assembly government following two deaths involving mental health patients .
secure mental health services fall into three categories - high , medium and low - and patients detained under the mental health act should be sent to the appropriate level of care .
but the report said there were several welsh patients who were being treated in high security institutions who did not require this level of care . "
they are stuck there not because of safety but because of lack of provision of lower cost , more effective community based services " bill walden-jones , chief executive hafal but they could not move because of delays in relocating them to lower security facilities , and because there is no dedicated medium secure facility in wales for the treatment of personality disorder .
the chief executive of mental health charity hafal , bill walden-jones , said : " underlying the whole report is the fundamental problem that people are blocked in the wrong level of security - that is to say that people are in expensive high secure facilities who could move down perfectly safely and in part there are large numbers of people stuck in medium secure who could be moved to lower safety services .
" they are stuck there not because of safety but because of lack of provision of lower cost , more effective community based services - it 's a daft situation . "
the report also strongly recommends that patients from south wales needing high security care should no longer be sent to ashworth on merseyside , but instead to broadmoor in berkshire - although this would require a reorganisation of english catchment areas .
a spokesman for wales ' health minister edwina hart said the study is out for consultation until 21 august .
" we will then consider the responses carefully in determining the way forward . "
ms hart has also admitted that the key one wales commitment to eliminate the use of the private sector in the nhs in wales by 2011 may not be achievable .
she was responding to a number of experts who told the dragon 's eye programme that secure mental health services in wales is completely reliant on private companies supporting public provision , and that very significant extra capital investment would be needed if the nhs were to have any chance of providing the vital services without the use of the private sector .
a spokesman for ms hart said that although investment was under way to increase nhs capacity for mental health treatment , the specialised nature of secure mental health services meant that the 2011 target might not be achievable in this area .
' annoyed ' conservative am jonathan morgan said he was frustrated his proposals for new powers for the assembly in mental health had still not made their way through westminster .
" what i 'm asking for is for parliament to devolve power to the assembly to allow us to legislate in order to provide quicker access to assessment , to provide more consistent access to treatment and care , and to provide independent advocacy for people with a mental illness in wales , " he said .
" it 's a huge job of work for us to get on with .
i 'm annoyed and frustrated that we 're being held up by parliament processing government legislation ahead of this particular piece of legislation . "
a spokesperson for the wales office said : " the government hopes to present mr morgan 's proposed lco -lrb- legislative competence order -rrb- to parliament shortly for pre-legislative scrutiny . "

advertisement some detained patients are being placed and held in inappropriate institutions , a study of mental health services finds .
a review of mental health services in wales has found that some detained patients are being placed and held in inappropriate institutions .
a lack of beds , escalating costs , poor communication and funding disputes in the service were blamed by the report .
the bbc 's dragon 's eye programme also claimed a bid for more assembly powers over mental health was being held up .
an assembly government spokesperson said it would consider responses to the study before deciding what to do .
the independent study was ordered by the assembly government following two deaths involving mental health patients .
secure mental health services fall into three categories - high , medium and low - and patients detained under the mental health act should be sent to the appropriate level of care .
but the report said there were several welsh patients who were being treated in high security institutions who did not require this level of care .
they are stuck there not because of safety but because of lack of provision of lower cost , more effective community based services bill walden-jones , chief executive hafal but they could not move because of delays in relocating them to lower security facilities , and because there is no dedicated medium secure facility in wales for the treatment of personality disorder .
the chief executive of mental health charity hafal , bill walden-jones , said : " underlying the whole report is the fundamental problem that people are blocked in the wrong level of security - that is to say that people are in expensive high secure facilities who could move down perfectly safely and in part there are large numbers of people stuck in medium secure who could be moved to lower safety services .
" they are stuck there not because of safety but because of lack of provision of lower cost , more effective community based services - it 's a daft situation . "
the report also strongly recommends that patients from south wales needing high security care should no longer be sent to ashworth on merseyside , but instead to broadmoor in berkshire - although this would require a reorganisation of english catchment areas .
a spokesman for wales ' health minister edwina hart said the study is out for consultation until 21 august .
" we will then consider the responses carefully in determining the way forward . "
ms hart has also admitted that the key one wales commitment to eliminate the use of the private sector in the nhs in wales by 2011 may not be achievable .
she was responding to a number of experts who told the dragon 's eye programme that secure mental health services in wales is completely reliant on private companies supporting public provision , and that very significant extra capital investment would be needed if the nhs were to have any chance of providing the vital services without the use of the private sector .
a spokesman for ms hart said that although investment was under way to increase nhs capacity for mental health treatment , the specialised nature of secure mental health services meant that the 2011 target might not be achievable in this area .
' annoyed ' conservative am jonathan morgan said he was frustrated his proposals for new powers for the assembly in mental health had still not made their way through westminster .
" what i 'm asking for is for parliament to devolve power to the assembly to allow us to legislate in order to provide quicker access to assessment , to provide more consistent access to treatment and care , and to provide independent advocacy for people with a mental illness in wales , " he said .
" it 's a huge job of work for us to get on with .
i 'm annoyed and frustrated that we 're being held up by parliament processing government legislation ahead of this particular piece of legislation . "
a spokesperson for the wales office said : " the government hopes to present mr morgan 's proposed lco -lrb- legislative competence order -rrb- to parliament shortly for pre-legislative scrutiny . "

leaked expenses claims in the paper show the dup couple claimed £ 160,000 in mortgage interest payments between 2004 and 2008 .
these were claimed for an apartment owned by the couple in london .
mr robinson said the money was claimed legitimately but both he and his party believed the system needed reform .
" there 's a world of difference between those who legitimately claim within the rules and those who are clearly operating outside the rules , " he said .
" i 'd be pretty sure that the amount that i actually spend would be more than that for which i have claimed . "
he said whatever system was introduced some people would still not be happy .

residents of mr robinson 's constituency give their reaction to the claims " i think if mps slept on a park bench and starved themselves that would still be too much for some people , " he said .
mps are entitled to claim up to £ 400 per month in food bills while away from their main home on parliamentary business .
receipts are not required .
the newspaper states that the couple each claimed the maximum in most months .
mr robinson , ni 's first minister , said that over the period his average weekly claim was around £ 70 which he said was not unreasonable for london .
the figure of around £ 70 for each of the robinsons can be calculated by dividing the total claim of £ 30,525 by the number of days in four years -lrb- 1406 -rrb- which gives an average joint daily claim of around £ 10.50 each .
the telegraph also reports that both mr robinson and his wife claimed around £ 1,200 for service charges on their london flat when they submitted a claim on 31 march 2007 .
mr robinson 's claim was rejected by a westminster official as iris robinson had already made the claim .
mr robinson said this was an innocent mistake .
" over all the years there was one inadvertent claim prepared by the person who prepared the claims and it was because both claims were put in the same envelope and sent to the house of commons .
" it was obviously something that would be spotted and happily it was , " he said .
my party colleagues and i want reform and indeed have voted for change .
such steps are necessary in order to gain public confidence peter robinson on the same day each claimed around £ 5,000 for five months ' mortgage interest payments .
this was also rejected and the reason stated was that no mortgage interest statements had been submitted to back up the claim .
it is not clear from documents whether the money was ever paid or whether the statements were submitted .
mr robinson said : " the claims were submitted consistent with house of commons rules and after fees office advice .
" many people hold the view that the rules for the payment of expenses should be changed .
" my party colleagues and i want reform and indeed have voted for change .
such steps are necessary in order to gain public confidence . "
he said the daily telegraph had " bunched the claims of my wife and i together " and given a total over four years in order to arrive at a high figure for the food expenses .
however , traditional unionist voice leader jim allister said public trust in politicians had been " rocked to its core " .
" in northern ireland the added dimensions of double-jobbing and family-dynasty building , has added to the public contempt , " he said .
" paying the weekly grocery bill is a huge struggle for many , so when extravagance , at the public expense , is flaunted , it offends right-thinking people . "
