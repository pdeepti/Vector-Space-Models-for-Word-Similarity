the netherlands is a flooded land dotted with minarets , france is on strike and britain is portrayed an empty space . an accompanying glossy brochure says the piece is a work by 27 artists representing all eu member states .
yet reporters could not locate any of them . after being pressed , the work 's chief author , conceptual artist david cerny , admitted that he invented his collaborators and concocted the artwork with two friends .
the trio apologized to the government . bulgaria not amused by toilet portrayal " it was a surprise .
respectively a shock , " czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra told the lidove noviny daily .
the revelation sparked a scandal in brussels .
instead of eu members making fun of themselves , it turned out the czechs mocked everyone else . cerny , who made his name through provocation , explained that the work lampoons socially-engaged art for public space that is toothless yet pretends to be controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cerny said he wanted to see whether europe could laugh at itself " we knew that the truth would come out .
prior to that , we wanted to find out whether europe is capable of making fun of itself , " the artist said in a statement . bulgaria did not find the work funny .
the balkan nation is offended by being depicted as a country of turkish squat toilets . " it represents our country as a toilet , a place people piss on , " bulgarian member of the european parliament dimitar stoyanov told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" if it is not removed we will remove it ourselves . " cerny defended himself , saying the work was in line with a long-running czech cultural tradition of art hoax and self-mockery . a prank or outright fraud ? czechs would have voted fictional hero , jara cimrman , the greatest czech in a 2005 television contest , were he not disqualified for never having lived . czech filmmakers once lured discount-hungry crowds to the opening of a fake supermarket and a secretive group of guerrilla artists was last year tried in court on scaremongering charges for sneaking images of a fake atomic mushroom cloud onto live television . but even those who have engaged in the prank tradition on wednesday saw cerny as having crossed the line . " what he did is a regular fraud .
it is no longer a hoax , " said ladislav smoljak , a co-author of the loser-genius cimrman . what the czech government plans to do next should be clear on thursday when the artwork 's sound , light and motion elements are to be switched on . prime minister mirek topolanek 's stoic comment suggests that the czechs are not considering removing or altering the piece . " i hope that when i will arrive in brussels i will find entropa and have a look at what made people laugh and roused them so much , " he said while visiting the eu parliament . special czech brand of humor in the end , cerny 's work backfired on prague 's eu presidency , which employed subversive czech humor in its own campaign . the presidency 's television advertisement ends in a punch line , in which czechs vow to " make it sweet for europe . "
the idiom has a double meaning : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time . " it 's fashion here and the government placed its bets on it , " said national gallery director and artist milan knizak .
" but it is a bad marketing move .
it does not work . " czech humor can be incomprehensible abroad owing to complex wordplays and cultural references .
at home , the recent abundance of artistic pranks raises questions whether it is not verging on the banal . " i find it boring , of course .
and i am trying to relay it to my students , " knizak said . dpa news agency -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .

bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .

the netherlands is a flooded land dotted with minarets , france is on strike and britain is portrayed an empty space . an accompanying glossy brochure says the piece is a work by 27 artists representing all eu member states .
yet reporters could not locate any of them . after being pressed , the work 's chief author , conceptual artist david cerny , admitted that he invented his collaborators and concocted the artwork with two friends .
the trio apologized to the government . bulgaria not amused by toilet portrayal " it was a surprise .
respectively a shock , " czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra told the lidove noviny daily .
the revelation sparked a scandal in brussels .
instead of eu members making fun of themselves , it turned out the czechs mocked everyone else . cerny , who made his name through provocation , explained that the work lampoons socially-engaged art for public space that is toothless yet pretends to be controversial . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : david cerny said he wanted to see whether europe could laugh at itself " we knew that the truth would come out .
prior to that , we wanted to find out whether europe is capable of making fun of itself , " the artist said in a statement . bulgaria did not find the work funny .
the balkan nation is offended by being depicted as a country of turkish squat toilets . " it represents our country as a toilet , a place people piss on , " bulgarian member of the european parliament dimitar stoyanov told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" if it is not removed we will remove it ourselves . " cerny defended himself , saying the work was in line with a long-running czech cultural tradition of art hoax and self-mockery . a prank or outright fraud ? czechs would have voted fictional hero , jara cimrman , the greatest czech in a 2005 television contest , were he not disqualified for never having lived . czech filmmakers once lured discount-hungry crowds to the opening of a fake supermarket and a secretive group of guerrilla artists was last year tried in court on scaremongering charges for sneaking images of a fake atomic mushroom cloud onto live television . but even those who have engaged in the prank tradition on wednesday saw cerny as having crossed the line . " what he did is a regular fraud .
it is no longer a hoax , " said ladislav smoljak , a co-author of the loser-genius cimrman . what the czech government plans to do next should be clear on thursday when the artwork 's sound , light and motion elements are to be switched on . prime minister mirek topolanek 's stoic comment suggests that the czechs are not considering removing or altering the piece . " i hope that when i will arrive in brussels i will find entropa and have a look at what made people laugh and roused them so much , " he said while visiting the eu parliament . special czech brand of humor in the end , cerny 's work backfired on prague 's eu presidency , which employed subversive czech humor in its own campaign . the presidency 's television advertisement ends in a punch line , in which czechs vow to " make it sweet for europe . "
the idiom has a double meaning : sweetening , but also to give someone a hard time . " it 's fashion here and the government placed its bets on it , " said national gallery director and artist milan knizak .
" but it is a bad marketing move .

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making .

he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands .

but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said .

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?

the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 14.01.2009 fishing for trouble among the philippines ’ coral reefs großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small-scale fishermen , like these in the maldives , are most at risk from the depleting stocks in the past decades , fish has gone from being a food product that could be bought at a regional level to a raw commodity that is traded on the world markets .
modern equipment has made it possible to expand fishing fleets .
european and japanese fleets in particular have started plundering the high seas for luxury fish .
marine biodiversity is at risk from the fishing industry , especially the use of destructive fishing methods such as dynamite fishing .
the fao estimates that 70 percent of the world ’ s commercial fish stocks are depleted or overfished .
it is a global exploitation with very local consequences . it is 11 a.m. in molopolo , a village in the south of the philippine island leyte .
six fishermen , wearing scarves to protect themselves from the sun , are pulling their boats to shore , where women are waiting .
they put their meagre catch of sardines into the women ’ s buckets and seek the shade of the coconut trees .
old jonathan nian son looks at the sea , tired .
he says that they only caught 20 kilos of fish despite being out at sea for seven hours .
he might get the equivalent of 16 euros for the fish .
that won ’ t even cover the cost of petrol .
there are some 35 million fishermen in the world today - most of them are the coastal inhabitants of poor countries .
an estimated 200 million jobs are directly linked with the fishing industry - in processing , marketing and delivery .
and overall , one billion people live from fishing .
experts are worried that a crisis , which has been in the making for over 20 years now , is about to escalate .
stocks are depleted , small fishermen can not compete with commercial fishermen using modern fishing methods .
those most at risk from the crisis are people living near the coastal waters of poor countries such as the philippines .
the coastal waters are extremely important for stabilising fish stocks in higher seas - coral reefs , algae and mangroves provide the breeding ground for some 90 percent of the fish sold and eaten worldwide .
william saavedra , another fisherman in molopolo , is angry .
he complains that there are more and more commercial fishermen using the zone around molopolo , which is supposed to be for local fishermen only .
he says the fish stocks in leyte have decreased by 90 percent in the past 20 years .
and he explains that small fishermen themselves have become thieves by using nets with narrow mesh and even more destructive fishing methods .
the detonation causes a big swell and there is a fountain-like movement .
the german aquarium fish dealer , thomas heeger , says dynamite fishing is very common and very efficient : " we hear it constantly under the water .
these small rum bottles are filled with ammonium nitrate , and then petrol and a detonator are put in .
there ’ s an explosion and the fish can be seen everywhere within a radius of 30 metres .
their swim bladder is ruptured and they float to the surface .
there are also big vats which can hold 10 to 15 kilos .
they are for the pelagic fish , which are further out at sea and move in shoals .
when the fishermen see the shoals they get there as fast as possible and throw one of these vats in . "
the problem is that such explosions destroy everything within a significant radius - crabs , young fish , corals .
now , 80 percent of the philippines ’ coral reefs are damaged and 80 percent of the mangroves have been cut down for wood . thomas kruchem -lrb- act -rrb- 14/01/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic feedback send us an e-mail .

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .

the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .

for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .

written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2009 crimean museum displays looted art from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan davidsz de heem 's still life from the 17th century is part of the " phantom gallery " some 200 works from an art collection in aachen , germany , disappeared into the former soviet union at the end of world war two .
parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's stimulus package convinces some , not all experts german chancellor merkel 's coalition has approved a 50-billion-euro stimulus package meant to boost growth and protect jobs in europe 's biggest economy .

growth predictions for 2009 vary between 5 and 8 percent , dragged down by the global economic downturn . china 's national statistics office said it would wait for the 2008 growth rates , expected for next week , and exchange rates calculations , before commenting . " up to now we have drawn no conclusions , " a spokesman said . the world bank in beijing confirmed the calculations , saying china was likely to have overtaken germany . " as far as i can see , the basic approach to the calculation is correct , although we would have to run the numbers to double check , " world bank economist ardo hanssen said . experts said the higher base for 2007 entailed lower growth rates than the 8 or 9 percent predicted for 2008 .
exports declined sharply towards the end of the year . china 's slowing economy could also be observed by a marked decline in energy consumption , electricity operator china state grid said . germany still ahead in per capita income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite strong exports , china still ranks low in terms of per capita income stephen green of the standard chartered bank in shanghai said china may have overtaken germany a long while ago , " since unofficial activity in china is larger than germany . " " moreover , at the end of the day , gdp is not a race - what really matters is per capita incomes , " green said . germany ranks 23rd in global per capita income in 2007 , while china came in at number 132 . the second upwards correction of the 2007 data led some analysts to believe that the government statisticians wanted to cover up the overheating of the chinese economy .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

" whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .

" litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .

during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to .

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 14.01.2009 report : china surpasses germany as third largest economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china may have a spot in the top three , but the future outlook is bleak china has taken germany 's spot as the world 's third-largest economy after the united states and japan , statistics released on wednesday showed . beijing 's national statistics bureau released corrected figures for the year 2007 , revising the gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth upwards from 11.9 percent to 13 percent , the largest increase since 1993 . total gdp figures were revised upwards by 777.6 billion yuan -lrb- $ 113.8 billion , 86.2 billion euros -rrb- , or 3.1 percent , to 25.73 trillion yuan , thereby overtaking germany 's output , experts said . according to germany 's statistics office , the country 's gdp was just below 2.49 trillion euros -lrb- $ 3.3 trillion -rrb- in the previous year . while the revised numbers grant china a spot in the top three , experts are less upbeat about the country 's economic outlook .
growth predictions for 2009 vary between 5 and 8 percent , dragged down by the global economic downturn . china 's national statistics office said it would wait for the 2008 growth rates , expected for next week , and exchange rates calculations , before commenting . " up to now we have drawn no conclusions , " a spokesman said . the world bank in beijing confirmed the calculations , saying china was likely to have overtaken germany . " as far as i can see , the basic approach to the calculation is correct , although we would have to run the numbers to double check , " world bank economist ardo hanssen said . experts said the higher base for 2007 entailed lower growth rates than the 8 or 9 percent predicted for 2008 .
exports declined sharply towards the end of the year . china 's slowing economy could also be observed by a marked decline in energy consumption , electricity operator china state grid said . germany still ahead in per capita income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite strong exports , china still ranks low in terms of per capita income stephen green of the standard chartered bank in shanghai said china may have overtaken germany a long while ago , " since unofficial activity in china is larger than germany . " " moreover , at the end of the day , gdp is not a race - what really matters is per capita incomes , " green said . germany ranks 23rd in global per capita income in 2007 , while china came in at number 132 . the second upwards correction of the 2007 data led some analysts to believe that the government statisticians wanted to cover up the overheating of the chinese economy .

modern equipment has made it possible to expand fishing fleets .
european and japanese fleets in particular have started plundering the high seas for luxury fish .
marine biodiversity is at risk from the fishing industry , especially the use of destructive fishing methods such as dynamite fishing .
the fao estimates that 70 percent of the world ’ s commercial fish stocks are depleted or overfished .
it is a global exploitation with very local consequences . it is 11 a.m. in molopolo , a village in the south of the philippine island leyte .
six fishermen , wearing scarves to protect themselves from the sun , are pulling their boats to shore , where women are waiting .
they put their meagre catch of sardines into the women ’ s buckets and seek the shade of the coconut trees .
old jonathan nian son looks at the sea , tired .
he says that they only caught 20 kilos of fish despite being out at sea for seven hours .
he might get the equivalent of 16 euros for the fish .
that won ’ t even cover the cost of petrol .
there are some 35 million fishermen in the world today - most of them are the coastal inhabitants of poor countries .
an estimated 200 million jobs are directly linked with the fishing industry - in processing , marketing and delivery .
and overall , one billion people live from fishing .
experts are worried that a crisis , which has been in the making for over 20 years now , is about to escalate .

the coastal waters are extremely important for stabilising fish stocks in higher seas - coral reefs , algae and mangroves provide the breeding ground for some 90 percent of the fish sold and eaten worldwide .
william saavedra , another fisherman in molopolo , is angry .
he complains that there are more and more commercial fishermen using the zone around molopolo , which is supposed to be for local fishermen only .
he says the fish stocks in leyte have decreased by 90 percent in the past 20 years .
and he explains that small fishermen themselves have become thieves by using nets with narrow mesh and even more destructive fishing methods .
the detonation causes a big swell and there is a fountain-like movement .
the german aquarium fish dealer , thomas heeger , says dynamite fishing is very common and very efficient : " we hear it constantly under the water .
these small rum bottles are filled with ammonium nitrate , and then petrol and a detonator are put in .
there ’ s an explosion and the fish can be seen everywhere within a radius of 30 metres .
their swim bladder is ruptured and they float to the surface .
there are also big vats which can hold 10 to 15 kilos .
they are for the pelagic fish , which are further out at sea and move in shoals .
when the fishermen see the shoals they get there as fast as possible and throw one of these vats in . "
the problem is that such explosions destroy everything within a significant radius - crabs , young fish , corals .

increased unemployment at the same time , officials at the ministry of economics and technology said both factory orders and industrial production fell more than expected in november .
the release of the latest german gdp figure comes just a day before the european central bank is expected to deliver another cut in interest rates to help spur economic growth in the 16-member euro zone .
meanwhile , the german labor office said unemployment rose for the first time in nearly three years in december , pushing the seasonally adjusted jobless rate up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in november .
modest retail sales increase however , german retail sales posted a bigger-than-forecast 0.7 percent rise in november , the nation 's statistics office said , as falling oil prices helped the country 's consumers to defy the growing global economic gloom and spend in the run-up to christmas .
analysts had forecast a more modest 0.5-percent month-on-month increase in seasonally adjusted retail sales during november . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?

dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .

their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

growth predictions for 2009 vary between 5 and 8 percent , dragged down by the global economic downturn . china 's national statistics office said it would wait for the 2008 growth rates , expected for next week , and exchange rates calculations , before commenting . " up to now we have drawn no conclusions , " a spokesman said . the world bank in beijing confirmed the calculations , saying china was likely to have overtaken germany . " as far as i can see , the basic approach to the calculation is correct , although we would have to run the numbers to double check , " world bank economist ardo hanssen said . experts said the higher base for 2007 entailed lower growth rates than the 8 or 9 percent predicted for 2008 .
exports declined sharply towards the end of the year . china 's slowing economy could also be observed by a marked decline in energy consumption , electricity operator china state grid said . germany still ahead in per capita income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite strong exports , china still ranks low in terms of per capita income stephen green of the standard chartered bank in shanghai said china may have overtaken germany a long while ago , " since unofficial activity in china is larger than germany . " " moreover , at the end of the day , gdp is not a race - what really matters is per capita incomes , " green said . germany ranks 23rd in global per capita income in 2007 , while china came in at number 132 . the second upwards correction of the 2007 data led some analysts to believe that the government statisticians wanted to cover up the overheating of the chinese economy .

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after turning in a solid 2.5-percent growth rate in 2007 , germany slumped into a recession in the third quarter last year .
a slew of data showed the slowdown in europe 's biggest economy rapidly gaining momentum as the year came to a close .
fourth-quarter expectations in the first quarter of 2008 , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose a strong 1.4 percent , only to decline by 0.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.5 percent in the third quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's exports economy is vulnerable the figure for the fourth quarter is not due to be released until february , but economic experts expect it to dip as much as 2 percent from the previous three months .
analysts fear the german economy could contract as much as 2.2 percent this year as the nation sinks into its worse economic downturn since the end of world war ii .
last week the nation 's statistics office said german exports , which are a key pillar of the country 's gdp , plunged by a dramatic 10.6 percent in november .
as the world 's leading export nation , germany appears particularly vulnerable in the face of a rapidly slumping world economy .
increased unemployment at the same time , officials at the ministry of economics and technology said both factory orders and industrial production fell more than expected in november .
the release of the latest german gdp figure comes just a day before the european central bank is expected to deliver another cut in interest rates to help spur economic growth in the 16-member euro zone .
meanwhile , the german labor office said unemployment rose for the first time in nearly three years in december , pushing the seasonally adjusted jobless rate up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in november .
modest retail sales increase however , german retail sales posted a bigger-than-forecast 0.7 percent rise in november , the nation 's statistics office said , as falling oil prices helped the country 's consumers to defy the growing global economic gloom and spend in the run-up to christmas .
analysts had forecast a more modest 0.5-percent month-on-month increase in seasonally adjusted retail sales during november . dpa news agency -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after turning in a solid 2.5-percent growth rate in 2007 , germany slumped into a recession in the third quarter last year .
a slew of data showed the slowdown in europe 's biggest economy rapidly gaining momentum as the year came to a close .
fourth-quarter expectations in the first quarter of 2008 , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose a strong 1.4 percent , only to decline by 0.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.5 percent in the third quarter .

analysts fear the german economy could contract as much as 2.2 percent this year as the nation sinks into its worse economic downturn since the end of world war ii .
last week the nation 's statistics office said german exports , which are a key pillar of the country 's gdp , plunged by a dramatic 10.6 percent in november .
as the world 's leading export nation , germany appears particularly vulnerable in the face of a rapidly slumping world economy .
increased unemployment at the same time , officials at the ministry of economics and technology said both factory orders and industrial production fell more than expected in november .
the release of the latest german gdp figure comes just a day before the european central bank is expected to deliver another cut in interest rates to help spur economic growth in the 16-member euro zone .
meanwhile , the german labor office said unemployment rose for the first time in nearly three years in december , pushing the seasonally adjusted jobless rate up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in november .
modest retail sales increase however , german retail sales posted a bigger-than-forecast 0.7 percent rise in november , the nation 's statistics office said , as falling oil prices helped the country 's consumers to defy the growing global economic gloom and spend in the run-up to christmas .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the netherlands is a flooded land dotted with minarets , france is on strike and britain is portrayed an empty space . an accompanying glossy brochure says the piece is a work by 27 artists representing all eu member states .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 14.01.2009 merkel warns obama over support for automotive big three großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars could be a divisive issue for the german chancellor and the new us president with carmakers all over the world hurting , german chancellor angela merkel has said she will confront us president-elect barack obama over washington 's automotive aid package .
but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- german ruling coalition agrees on stimulus package the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed .

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

growth predictions for 2009 vary between 5 and 8 percent , dragged down by the global economic downturn . china 's national statistics office said it would wait for the 2008 growth rates , expected for next week , and exchange rates calculations , before commenting . " up to now we have drawn no conclusions , " a spokesman said . the world bank in beijing confirmed the calculations , saying china was likely to have overtaken germany . " as far as i can see , the basic approach to the calculation is correct , although we would have to run the numbers to double check , " world bank economist ardo hanssen said . experts said the higher base for 2007 entailed lower growth rates than the 8 or 9 percent predicted for 2008 .

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's stimulus package convinces some , not all experts german chancellor merkel 's coalition has approved a 50-billion-euro stimulus package meant to boost growth and protect jobs in europe 's biggest economy .
but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- german ruling coalition agrees on stimulus package the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2009 crimean museum displays looted art from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan davidsz de heem 's still life from the 17th century is part of the " phantom gallery " some 200 works from an art collection in aachen , germany , disappeared into the former soviet union at the end of world war two .
parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" disappointing " result at midday wednesday , deutsche bank shares had slumped 8.8 percent to 22.16 euros a share .
in 2007 , the bank recorded a record profit of 6.5 billion euros .

" the exceptionally difficult market environment of the quarter exposed some weaknesses in our platform , and we have determined a number of measures to address these weaknesses .
implementation of these measures is already under way , " he said .
post jumps in to aid deutsche bank meanwhile on wednesday , deutsche post confirmed its plan to take a stake in deutsche bank , thus helping it securing the sale of the post subsidiary postbank , to deutsche bank .
financial sources reported that deutsche post would take a stake of around 8 percent in deutsche bank for a period of less than 12 months , under a renegotiated deal .

" there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .
" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert .

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .
a peaceful iraq also offered alternatives to the gas and oil dependency on moscow . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the netherlands is a flooded land dotted with minarets , france is on strike and britain is portrayed an empty space . an accompanying glossy brochure says the piece is a work by 27 artists representing all eu member states .

the trio apologized to the government . bulgaria not amused by toilet portrayal " it was a surprise .

the revelation sparked a scandal in brussels .

it is no longer a hoax , " said ladislav smoljak , a co-author of the loser-genius cimrman . what the czech government plans to do next should be clear on thursday when the artwork 's sound , light and motion elements are to be switched on . prime minister mirek topolanek 's stoic comment suggests that the czechs are not considering removing or altering the piece .

" both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .
such actions are just unacceptable , " he added . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2009 crimean museum displays looted art from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan davidsz de heem 's still life from the 17th century is part of the " phantom gallery " some 200 works from an art collection in aachen , germany , disappeared into the former soviet union at the end of world war two .
parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .

merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .

she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .

the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

growth predictions for 2009 vary between 5 and 8 percent , dragged down by the global economic downturn . china 's national statistics office said it would wait for the 2008 growth rates , expected for next week , and exchange rates calculations , before commenting . " up to now we have drawn no conclusions , " a spokesman said . the world bank in beijing confirmed the calculations , saying china was likely to have overtaken germany . " as far as i can see , the basic approach to the calculation is correct , although we would have to run the numbers to double check , " world bank economist ardo hanssen said . experts said the higher base for 2007 entailed lower growth rates than the 8 or 9 percent predicted for 2008 .
exports declined sharply towards the end of the year . china 's slowing economy could also be observed by a marked decline in energy consumption , electricity operator china state grid said . germany still ahead in per capita income bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : despite strong exports , china still ranks low in terms of per capita income stephen green of the standard chartered bank in shanghai said china may have overtaken germany a long while ago , " since unofficial activity in china is larger than germany . " " moreover , at the end of the day , gdp is not a race - what really matters is per capita incomes , " green said . germany ranks 23rd in global per capita income in 2007 , while china came in at number 132 . the second upwards correction of the 2007 data led some analysts to believe that the government statisticians wanted to cover up the overheating of the chinese economy .

after turning in a solid 2.5-percent growth rate in 2007 , germany slumped into a recession in the third quarter last year .
a slew of data showed the slowdown in europe 's biggest economy rapidly gaining momentum as the year came to a close .
fourth-quarter expectations in the first quarter of 2008 , gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- rose a strong 1.4 percent , only to decline by 0.4 percent in the second quarter and 0.5 percent in the third quarter .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's exports economy is vulnerable the figure for the fourth quarter is not due to be released until february , but economic experts expect it to dip as much as 2 percent from the previous three months .
analysts fear the german economy could contract as much as 2.2 percent this year as the nation sinks into its worse economic downturn since the end of world war ii .
last week the nation 's statistics office said german exports , which are a key pillar of the country 's gdp , plunged by a dramatic 10.6 percent in november .
as the world 's leading export nation , germany appears particularly vulnerable in the face of a rapidly slumping world economy .
increased unemployment at the same time , officials at the ministry of economics and technology said both factory orders and industrial production fell more than expected in november .
the release of the latest german gdp figure comes just a day before the european central bank is expected to deliver another cut in interest rates to help spur economic growth in the 16-member euro zone .
meanwhile , the german labor office said unemployment rose for the first time in nearly three years in december , pushing the seasonally adjusted jobless rate up to 7.6 percent from 7.5 percent in november .

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 14.01.2009 merkel warns obama over support for automotive big three großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars could be a divisive issue for the german chancellor and the new us president with carmakers all over the world hurting , german chancellor angela merkel has said she will confront us president-elect barack obama over washington 's automotive aid package .
but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's stimulus package convinces some , not all experts german chancellor merkel 's coalition has approved a 50-billion-euro stimulus package meant to boost growth and protect jobs in europe 's biggest economy .

the netherlands is a flooded land dotted with minarets , france is on strike and britain is portrayed an empty space . an accompanying glossy brochure says the piece is a work by 27 artists representing all eu member states .
yet reporters could not locate any of them . after being pressed , the work 's chief author , conceptual artist david cerny , admitted that he invented his collaborators and concocted the artwork with two friends .
the trio apologized to the government . bulgaria not amused by toilet portrayal " it was a surprise .
respectively a shock , " czech vice-premier for european affairs alexandr vondra told the lidove noviny daily .
the revelation sparked a scandal in brussels .

prior to that , we wanted to find out whether europe is capable of making fun of itself , " the artist said in a statement . bulgaria did not find the work funny .
the balkan nation is offended by being depicted as a country of turkish squat toilets . " it represents our country as a toilet , a place people piss on , " bulgarian member of the european parliament dimitar stoyanov told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" if it is not removed we will remove it ourselves . " cerny defended himself , saying the work was in line with a long-running czech cultural tradition of art hoax and self-mockery . a prank or outright fraud ? czechs would have voted fictional hero , jara cimrman , the greatest czech in a 2005 television contest , were he not disqualified for never having lived . czech filmmakers once lured discount-hungry crowds to the opening of a fake supermarket and a secretive group of guerrilla artists was last year tried in court on scaremongering charges for sneaking images of a fake atomic mushroom cloud onto live television . but even those who have engaged in the prank tradition on wednesday saw cerny as having crossed the line . " what he did is a regular fraud .
it is no longer a hoax , " said ladislav smoljak , a co-author of the loser-genius cimrman . what the czech government plans to do next should be clear on thursday when the artwork 's sound , light and motion elements are to be switched on . prime minister mirek topolanek 's stoic comment suggests that the czechs are not considering removing or altering the piece . " i hope that when i will arrive in brussels i will find entropa and have a look at what made people laugh and roused them so much , " he said while visiting the eu parliament . special czech brand of humor in the end , cerny 's work backfired on prague 's eu presidency , which employed subversive czech humor in its own campaign . the presidency 's television advertisement ends in a punch line , in which czechs vow to " make it sweet for europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 14.01.2009 eu , israel suspend talks as war in gaza rages on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel 's offensive against hamas in the gaza strip has killed more than 1,000 people the eu and israel have put negotiations on upgrading bilateral ties on hold due to the gaza war , officials from both sides said wednesday as the german foreign minister travels to the region to help end the fighting . " there is a time-out in the furthering of the upgrading of bilateral relations , " ramiro cibrian-uzal , the head of the european commission delegation to israel told reporters .
" both sides decided it was appropriate to take a time out .
both sides realize it is a convenient time for a time-out . " " we will have to see how long and how deep the time-out is - how the conflict stabilizes and how israel will emerge as a partner for the eu out of the conflict , " he added . bilateral relations have been strained by israel 's 19-day-old military offensive on hamas targets in gaza which medics report has so far killed more than 1,000 palestinians .
ten israeli soldiers and three civilians hit by hamas rockets fired across the border have also died since dec .
27 . cibrian-uzal said the move was not intended as a sanction against the jewish state . " there is a mutual agreement on the issue , " he said .

" the european union has never contemplated to my knowledge and has never seriously envisaged sanctions " against israel . a spokesman for the israeli foreign ministry , yigal palmor , confirmed that israel had agreed to freeze the negotations . " both israel and the eu agreed to suspend the talks after it was obvious that the two sides had more urgent issues to deal with , " palmor told news agency afp . humanitarian organizations vindicated the move follows pleas from humanitarian organizations urging the eu to suspend its plans to upgrade ties with israel until there was a ceasefire in gaza and aid was allowed to flow to the region 's suffering civilian population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community is calling for a ceasefire and access for aid supplies " it is inconceivable that we should extend further benefits of european partnership to a government that violates international humanitarian law and refuses negotiation in favor of continued violence , " daleep mukarji , director of christian aid uk and ireland said in a statement supported by oxfam international and the international federation for human rights -lrb- fidh -rrb- among other groups . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner did not comment on the decision during a debate on gaza held at the european parliament in strasbourg on wednesday . however , her spokeswoman christiane hohmann said that the priority is " to concentrate on the search for a political solution in gaza and the access of humanitarian aid , not on the holding of technical talks . " the eu 's foreign ministers decided in december to upgrade relations with israel while at the same time calling for the jewish state to reach out to the palestinians and arab nations . steinmeier to push again for gaza truce meanwhile , efforts by eu diplomats to secure a ceasefire continue . on wednesday , berlin announced that german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier would travel to the middle east for the second time in a week to continue pushing for a truce . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is on a second trip within a week to the mideast to seek a ceasefire his trip will include talks in jerusalem with the israeli government as well as visits to the ramallah and cairo , his spokesman jens ploetner told reporters . " the goal of the foreign minister 's efforts is to open a way towards a lasting and comprehensive ceasefire , " ploetner said . despite the alarming death toll in gaza , french foreign minister bernard kouchner expressed his optimism that a ceasefire was in the making . " the outlines of a ceasefire have begun to appear , even if we still have to face serious obstacles , " kouchner told the french parliament .
" i 'm convinced that our efforts will bear fruit . " ban urges de-escalation un secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was concerned at reports wednesday of lebanese rocket attacks against israel and urged all parties in the region to avoid actions that could make a bad situation worse .
" that is ... a very alarming , very disturbing and troubling situation , " ban told reporters in the jordanian capital amman on the first day of a week-long tour of the middle east .
ban said that un peacekeepers in lebanon , known as unifil , were investigating the rocket attacks launched from inside lebanon .
the incident took place on the 19th day of israel 's offensive against hamas militants in the gaza strip .
" i again strongly urge all the parties concerned in this region ... to refrain from taking such violent actions which will destabilize the situation , " ban said .
" we are now going through a very difficult process to bring a ceasefire , to bring stability back to gaza .

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the eu be able to agree on its responsibilities and be willing to take on more ? during his campaign , us president-elect barack obama said he believed the invasion of iraq undermined efforts to defeat the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan .
he has vowed to focus more strongly on afghanistan after taking office on jan .
20 . yet with a serious economic crisis battering the united states , the new administration in washington will have less financial leeway to put money into security issues .
analysts agree that obama will call on the europeans for help , for example in increasing the number of international troops in afghanistan . according to the german council on foreign relations -lrb- dgap -rrb- in berlin , the european union has to be ready to face these demands . " the eu member states have to clarify : what do we expect from the americans ?
what can we offer them ? "
dgap 's eberhard sandschneider said .
however , the eu at the moment was " not capable of acting . " in addition , the eu 's rotating presidency this year is being held by two small and less influential countries : the czech republic at present and from july , sweden .
they will hardly have the ability to bring the eu into a common position , sandschneider said . germany should set a good example obama is expected to seek more support in afghanistan , particularly from french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel . bildunterschrift : obama will expect european allies such as german chancellor merkel to take more responsibilty on international issues sarkozy has already signaled a willingness to add several hundred more troops .
their use would remain restricted , though . germany and france have over 3,000 troops each in afghanistan .
but they are limited to peacekeeping , rebuilding and training missions , and are banned from participating in the heavy fighting in southern and eastern afghanistan . days after obama 's election , merkel made it clear she would not yield to pressure to send troops to fight . for obama to succeed on the issue in europe , he will have to maintain a sustained dialog , said jackson janes , an analyst of us-european relations at the american institute for contemporary german studies at johns hopkins university .
the new president will have to persuade the german and french public that it 's in their national security interests to ensure that nato prevails in afghanistan , rather than to simply make demands , janes said . " obama needs to get into their heads that we are not just talking about -lrb- president george w. -rrb-
bush now , we are talking about a strategic framework , " janes said . sandschneider said it was now important for the german government to set a good example . " the times in which other countries ensured our security are over , " he said .
" security costs money .
our politicians have to make that clear to the citizens . " in addition , after years of complaining about bush , europe should show a desire to help obama tackle the vast foreign policy challenges he will face after he takes office , janes said . " there has to be a willingness on the part of the european leadership to want to help this man , " janes said . us plans could boost german economy the upcoming german parliamentary elections in september could not be used as a pretext to dodge costs and foreign policy responsibilities , sandschneider said . " whoever wants to utilize the opportunities of globalization has to be willing to participate in the costs of worldwide stabilization , " sandschneider said . according to sandschneider , obama 's planned economic stimulus package could also benefit germany economically , as it included investments in renewable energies .
german companies are worldwide pioneers in this sector and could tap new business opportunities across the atlantic . in addition , german support for obama 's efforts to resume talks with iran would have " positive effects " on the dependency on russian gas reserves , sandschneider said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture & lifestyle -pipe- 14.01.2009 crimean museum displays looted art from germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan davidsz de heem 's still life from the 17th century is part of the " phantom gallery " some 200 works from an art collection in aachen , germany , disappeared into the former soviet union at the end of world war two .
parts of these works have now surfaced in ukraine , prompting a rare exchange initiative . the exhibition " phantom gallery " in aachen 's suermondt-ludwig-museum is unusual and for many visitors , irritating .
in part , empty frames hang on the darkly painted walls or black-and-white photographs - reproductions of artwork whose whereabouts are unknown . " we are showing pictures , which are no longer here , " said museum director peter van den brink . shortly after the exhibition opened in september , van den brink received surprising news from ukraine . german tourists had discovered a number of works of german origin in the simferopol art museum in crimea .
the couple photographed and filmed the works , and handed the complete material over to the aachen art expert . " we were therefore able to even identify pictures which we had documented in our loss catalog , " van den brink said . keeping away from politics getting in touch with his colleagues in simferopol was surprisingly quick and easy , van den brink said .
soon , a small team of experts from aachen will be heading to the crimean capital .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : company in a garden , playing music by johann hulsman " we 're going there as a research team in order to determine which pictures exactly are there and in what sort of condition they 're in , " said curator heinrich becker . the head of the simferopol art museum larina kudryashova turned out to be an open and communicative person , van den brink said . " as opposed to her colleagues in the former soviet union , she had no fears about taking the necessary step and opening doors , " he said .
the dutchman said he placed emphasis on personal contacts and wanted to avoid political complications on the delicate topic of looted art . that 's exactly what kudryashova wanted too . she too emphasized seeking dialog among experts and preferably excluding politics .
she said she had high expectations from the visit from germany .
she hoped for cooperation on a large scale , which would benefit not only her museum , but also other cultural facilities in simferopol . " precisely because we are not politicians , but rather museum staff , i expect a constructive collaboration , " kudryashova said .
" we will combine our efforts . " looted art as compensation the story of the looted artwork began in 1942 with the stock removal of paintings from aachen .
the works from the 17th to 19th centuries - in part very valuable - were moved to the albrechtsburg castle in meissen near dresden in eastern germany to be protected from bombings . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many works of looted art were returned after the war ended at the time , aachen was suffering greatly under the air attacks by the royal air force and dresden was far away .
no one could foresee at the time that worse bombings were to come with the red army tied up in bloody battles in stalingrad . the paintings probably ended up in ukraine as looted art via moscow or the former leningrad , today saint petersburg .
for decades , they remained stored away .
now , of course , they can be viewed in simferopol 's art museum - with explicit mention of their provenance . the museum stresses that the pictures are considered compensation for ukraine 's own destroyed cultural goods .
this corresponds to existing ukrainian laws , kudryashova said . project with pitfalls at the same time , the ukrainian art expert has suggested a joint exchange project . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ice-skating by anthonie verstraelen " one could show part of the works we have in aachen and in exchange , the german side could make works of the same value available to us to show in simferopol , " kudryashova said . aachen 's museum director van den brink said he liked the idea but also foresaw pitfalls .
for one , he said , he did n't even know whether kudryashova was authorized to realize such a project .
after all , she was not the cultural minister of ukraine . in addition , he said he had to discuss with the german foreign office " whether we can even bring our pictures back to germany , without them being directly confiscated due to legal regulations . " van den brink said he was obligated to stick to existing laws and fundamental claims to the works .
he said he wanted to exclude political implications , international regulations and german sensitivities on the issue .
this was up to top-level politics . but he said he could imagine that the findings in simferopol would be discussed at the top level at some point , for example during a visit by german chancellor angela merkel to ukraine . cornelia rabitz -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de united states -pipe- 14.01.2009 merkel warns obama over support for automotive big three großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cars could be a divisive issue for the german chancellor and the new us president with carmakers all over the world hurting , german chancellor angela merkel has said she will confront us president-elect barack obama over washington 's automotive aid package .
but is the pot calling the kettle black ? merkel 's remarks came as her governing conservative-social democratic coalition announced a massive 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- economic stimulus plan .
" of course , we wo n't be able to just stand by and watch how the american automotive industry is kept alive by billions of dollars , " merkel told reporters in berlin on tuesday , january 13 .
the us government has offered general motors , chrysler and ford up to 17.4 billion dollars in state help .
merkel added that , should germany feel itself to be at a competitive disadvantage , the two countries would have to have " serious discussions . "
those talks could come at the world financial summit in april in london , where the world 's most powerful leaders will try to agree new rules for the global financial markets .
german car exports fell by 22 percent in december 2008 , compared with the year before , as a result of the global economic crisis .
the american automotive market contracted by around 18 percent over the same period .
a subsidy by any other name ?
bildunterschrift : german carmakers , too , are getting plenty of state help this winter with european leaders looking to obama for leadership at the london summit , it 's questionable how serious merkel 's warning was meant .
and germany itself has offered sops to its domestic automotive industry .
the equivalent of some $ 2 billion dollars in the stimulus plan has been earmarked for the german automotive industry .
merkel has said that carmarker opel , the european wing of general motors , could get up to 1.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.1 billion -rrb- in loan guarantees to help the company survive the economic downswing .
the german government has also waived taxes on new car purchases for 2009 and offered a 2500 euro premium for drivers who scrap cars more than 10 years old , if they purchase new vehicles .
the latter initiative mirrors a similar measure taken in france .
it 's being sold , in part , as a way of getting germans to convert to more ecologically friendly cars , but the automotive industry hopes it will boost domestic car sales as well .
according to some estimates , the buy-back premium could encourage as many as 300,000 new vehicle purchases .
other analysts , however , doubt that the premium will have a significant effect on people 's decisions to buy a new set of wheels in a year when the economy threatens to grind to a halt . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's stimulus package convinces some , not all experts german chancellor merkel 's coalition has approved a 50-billion-euro stimulus package meant to boost growth and protect jobs in europe 's biggest economy .
but not all experts are convinced it can help beat the downturn .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- german ruling coalition agrees on stimulus package the three parties of germany 's grand coalition have agreed on a fresh round of stimulus measures worth billions to protect the weakening economy .
but some already worry the package will not offer the help that 's needed .
-lrb- 13.01.2009 -rrb- germany 's christian democrats agree on stimulus package the party of chancellor angela merkel has agreed on a second stimulus package to bolster the economy in the face of the global financial crisis .
other parties in the governing coalition are expected to follow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 14.01.2009 russian security plan prompts fears over future energy wars großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : architects of a new russian security strategy : medvedev and putin the eu 's diplomatic efforts in the russia-ukraine crisis may have focused on restoring the flow of gas but could it also have been trying to avoid a more ominous escalation as predicted by a russian security document ? the latest gas dispute between russia and ukraine which once again hit european union countries in the depths of winter prompted some intense shuttle diplomacy by leaders and officials from the supplier nation , the transit nation and the affected clients . while the eu was mainly focused in its efforts to restart the flow of gas in a bid to reheat shivering member states on russia 's borders , the level of political involvement on europe 's part may have been motivated by other more sinister factors . in june 2008 , russian president dmitry medvedev ordered a new security document entitled " strategy of national security of the russian federation until the year 2020 . "
written under the direction of nikolay patrushev , secretary of the kremlin 's security council , the document reportedly sent tremors of concern through western governments . the document , which is expected to be adopted at a state council meeting on february 20 , claims that russia has overcome the " consequences of the systemic political and socioeconomic crisis of the late 20th century " and has now restored its capacity to promote its national interest through " multipolar international relations " . after predictably naming the united states as its main rival , the document then ominously describes how russia may maintain its position in the world in future and raises the specter of future military conflict over energy resources . struggle for resources to take on military angle : report bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the caspian sea is one area russia wants access to " -lrb- russia 's -rrb- international policy will focus on the access to the energy sources of the world , including the middle east , barents sea , the arctic region , caspian sea and central asia , " it reads .
" the struggle for the hydrocarbon resources can be developed to the military confrontation as well , which can result with violation of balance on russia 's borders with the allies and the increasing of the nuclear countries . " the document goes on to suggest that existing conflicts in iraq and afghanistan , middle east , some of the south asian and african countries , as well as in korean peninsula " will have a continued negative impact on the international situation over the next 12 years . " the draft document 's announcement allegedly led to a number of western nations reviewing their energy security policies in relation to potential threats emanating from russia .
it is therefore understandable , if reports of these reviews are true , that the european union was more concerned than usual when russia and ukraine entered into their latest dispute over gas . experts divided over possibility of actual gas wars while the document assumes the possibility of future military conflicts erupting over energy resources , it has prompted widespread disagreement among academics and security experts who are divided over whether the term ' gas war ' , currently used to describe diplomatic spats , will eventually become a literal term . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and yuschenko in less fraught times " i think it is worth worrying about the possibility of conflicts being fought over energy resources in the future but in the case of russia and ukraine , it 's highly unlikely that this would have been the case , " daniel litvin , senior research fellow with the energy , environment and development program at chatham house , the headquarters of the royal institute of international affairs in london , told dw-world.de. " it 's not in russia 's interests to go to war over its gas supplies .
the dispute with ukraine has already damaged its reputation as a provider and has been economically damaging as well , " litvin added .
" russia continued to be a strong and reliable supplier of both gas and oil during the cold war when its enmity with the west was at its highest so i don ’ t think this will be happen . " litvin believes that even though most governments consider war to be a last resort , there is always a slight chance that an escalation in tensions or a continued embargo lasting weeks or even months could prompt one country or another to consider a military solution .
" this is why we have seen such intense diplomacy in the russia-ukraine dispute because the longer a disagreement of this seriousness goes on , the more desperate people can become , " he said . claims that caucasus conflict was first gas war some observers have suggested that the security strategy document has already prompted russia 's first military action in defense of its energy resources . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how big an issue was gas in the caucasus conflict ?
during the august 2008 war in the caucasus region , russia accused georgia of cutting gas to south ossetia and it has been suggested that one of the objectives of the conflict was to secure pipelines in the region and to keep the gas flowing to the rebel republic .
russia has since floated the idea of a pipeline directly to south ossetia , bypassing georgia entirely . " some people say that all wars are about energy but i ’ m not in that camp , " says litvin .
" the middle east conflicts of the last few decades have almost certainly had an energy security dimension but i do n't agree that these wars have been waged purely to secure resources . " the russia-georgia war of last year most likely had a similar energy dimension - considering the gas pipelines coming from azerbaijan and the caspian sea through georgia and the fact that the west has been looking into alternatives to russian energy - but as with the war in iraq , the security of resources was somewhere in the overall mix , not a main objective , " he added . global competition for resources increases risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conflicts fought over resources could increase while it remains unlikely that russia and ukraine will go to war over gas disputes in the immediate future , russia 's focus on maintaining access to global energy sources suggests that increased competition for decreasing reserves could lead to longer term confrontations , a scenario daniel litvin subscribes to . " the securing of access to dwindling resources like oil in the middle east and gas in asia could bring china , the us , europe and india into intense competition , " he said . " military planning in many countries is already part of energy policy and military planners place high importance on energy security .
we ’ re already seeing the early signs of increased competition in africa where the us and china are looking to secure oil supplies and exert influence .
as this level of competition intensifies in areas of the world where resources remain , we could see an increase in the militarization of the energy sector . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" disappointing " result at midday wednesday , deutsche bank shares had slumped 8.8 percent to 22.16 euros a share .
in 2007 , the bank recorded a record profit of 6.5 billion euros .

" the exceptionally difficult market environment of the quarter exposed some weaknesses in our platform , and we have determined a number of measures to address these weaknesses .
implementation of these measures is already under way , " he said .
post jumps in to aid deutsche bank meanwhile on wednesday , deutsche post confirmed its plan to take a stake in deutsche bank , thus helping it securing the sale of the post subsidiary postbank , to deutsche bank .
financial sources reported that deutsche post would take a stake of around 8 percent in deutsche bank for a period of less than 12 months , under a renegotiated deal .
in september , the two sides had agreed on the sale of postbank , but that bank 's shares have dropped precipitously since the deal was inked .
new deal speeds transaction under the new deal , valued at 4.9 billion euros , deutsche bank will partly pay for the purchase in deutsche bank shares and will take over the postbank earlier than planned .
the new plan allows deutsche bank to retain more of its capital , while the post can then " exit its banking business more quickly and with less risk , " both companies said wednesday .

everyone has heard of the hospital superbug mrsa - and many have a view on how to stop it .
but in this week 's health opinion column scrubbing up , king 's fund researcher tammy boyce warns poor dirty hospitals have been wrongly dubbed the only culprits .
when paris hilton went to jail in 2007 , her parting words were not an apology for her irresponsible behaviour .
far from being embarrassed , hilton said she was more worried about catching mrsa - and her fear is not unusual .
in the uk , when people think about going into hospital , they are more afraid of contracting mrsa than dying .
as more people die than contract mrsa , how can the public 's fears be explained ?
concentrating on young and relatively healthy victims encourages the public to see mrsa as something we should all be afraid of , all of the time mrsa is a serious problem in the uk - hospital acquired infections -lrb- hai -rrb- are a problem in most western nations .
however , the uk media have paid it much more attention .
between 1997-2007 , the top six newspapers in the us published 177 articles about mrsa , compared with over 4,300 in the top six uk papers .
this substantial difference helps explain why the public is so afraid .
celebrities and tragedies much of the uk newspaper coverage centres around individual 's stories .
tragic stories about young children or pregnant women contracting mrsa get a great deal of coverage , as do stories about celebrities such as leslie ash , edwyn collins and claire rayner contracting a hospital acquired infection .
cleaning is not the whole solution but the typical victims of mrsa - the elderly and the very ill - tend to be missing .
concentrating on young and relatively healthy victims encourages the public to see mrsa as something we should all be afraid of , all of the time .
television news , however , tends to ignore these more tabloid-style stories .
it rarely reports mrsa , compared to newspaper coverage and when it does , it is primarily responding to government press releases .
national ' mrsa ' service in addition to the commonly reported story of the " tragedy of mrsa " is the " if only we cleaned hospitals better mrsa would disappear " story .
journalists berate doctors and nurses for failing to wash their hands , their white coats and their ties .
tabloids regularly send undercover journalists to report on the filthy state of local hospitals .
instead of tiring of these repetitive stories , we , the public , lap them up .
the public deserves a more realistic picture of the problem of mrsa read your comments the so-called dire state of uk hospitals and the problem of mrsa has come to represent the failure of the nhs , with one daily mail columnist renaming the nhs the ' national mrsa service ' .
get to grips the problem is , that most coverage fails to report the reams of scientific research on the causes and potential solutions to mrsa .
instead , the focus is on cleaning and poor hygiene , and on the more unusual and often untested solutions , such as bug-busting pyjamas .
the question to ask is not simply ' why are n't hospitals clean ? '
cleaning is part of the answer , but so is the reduction of antibiotics , which is regarded as one of the most effective ways of reducing mrsa .
increasing the number of isolation units so those with mrsa can be treated without the fear of infecting others is also part of the answer , as well as reducing bed occupancy in hospitals .
the media should reflect the whole story about mrsa .
it could report how gps should respond when patients demand antibiotics , or ask why the nhs is n't funding isolation units when research shows they reduce mrsa rates .
if the media covered these stories on their front pages or on the morning news - would they help to start a different public debate ?
research from queen 's medical centre in nottingham recently found patients anxious and concerned about contracting mrsa in hospital .
their most frequent source of this information - the media .
mrsa is a problem and should be reported , but if all the coverage is doing is making people anxious , the media need to ask itself if it is part of the problem .
when the government announces rates have fallen , as they have recently , the media either fails to report them or tucks the story in the back pages .
reassuring stories might not be the most interesting for news editors , but the public deserves a more realistic picture of the problem of mrsa .

everyone has heard of the hospital superbug mrsa - and many have a view on how to stop it .
but in this week 's health opinion column scrubbing up , king 's fund researcher tammy boyce warns poor dirty hospitals have been wrongly dubbed the only culprits .
when paris hilton went to jail in 2007 , her parting words were not an apology for her irresponsible behaviour .
far from being embarrassed , hilton said she was more worried about catching mrsa - and her fear is not unusual .
in the uk , when people think about going into hospital , they are more afraid of contracting mrsa than dying .
as more people die than contract mrsa , how can the public 's fears be explained ?
concentrating on young and relatively healthy victims encourages the public to see mrsa as something we should all be afraid of , all of the time mrsa is a serious problem in the uk - hospital acquired infections -lrb- hai -rrb- are a problem in most western nations .
however , the uk media have paid it much more attention .
between 1997-2007 , the top six newspapers in the us published 177 articles about mrsa , compared with over 4,300 in the top six uk papers .
this substantial difference helps explain why the public is so afraid .
celebrities and tragedies much of the uk newspaper coverage centres around individual 's stories .
tragic stories about young children or pregnant women contracting mrsa get a great deal of coverage , as do stories about celebrities such as leslie ash , edwyn collins and claire rayner contracting a hospital acquired infection .
cleaning is not the whole solution but the typical victims of mrsa - the elderly and the very ill - tend to be missing .
concentrating on young and relatively healthy victims encourages the public to see mrsa as something we should all be afraid of , all of the time .
television news , however , tends to ignore these more tabloid-style stories .
it rarely reports mrsa , compared to newspaper coverage and when it does , it is primarily responding to government press releases .
national ' mrsa ' service in addition to the commonly reported story of the " tragedy of mrsa " is the " if only we cleaned hospitals better mrsa would disappear " story .
journalists berate doctors and nurses for failing to wash their hands , their white coats and their ties .
tabloids regularly send undercover journalists to report on the filthy state of local hospitals .
instead of tiring of these repetitive stories , we , the public , lap them up .
the public deserves a more realistic picture of the problem of mrsa read your comments the so-called dire state of uk hospitals and the problem of mrsa has come to represent the failure of the nhs , with one daily mail columnist renaming the nhs the ' national mrsa service ' .
get to grips the problem is , that most coverage fails to report the reams of scientific research on the causes and potential solutions to mrsa .
instead , the focus is on cleaning and poor hygiene , and on the more unusual and often untested solutions , such as bug-busting pyjamas .
the question to ask is not simply ' why are n't hospitals clean ? '
cleaning is part of the answer , but so is the reduction of antibiotics , which is regarded as one of the most effective ways of reducing mrsa .
increasing the number of isolation units so those with mrsa can be treated without the fear of infecting others is also part of the answer , as well as reducing bed occupancy in hospitals .
the media should reflect the whole story about mrsa .
it could report how gps should respond when patients demand antibiotics , or ask why the nhs is n't funding isolation units when research shows they reduce mrsa rates .
if the media covered these stories on their front pages or on the morning news - would they help to start a different public debate ?
research from queen 's medical centre in nottingham recently found patients anxious and concerned about contracting mrsa in hospital .
their most frequent source of this information - the media .
mrsa is a problem and should be reported , but if all the coverage is doing is making people anxious , the media need to ask itself if it is part of the problem .
when the government announces rates have fallen , as they have recently , the media either fails to report them or tucks the story in the back pages .
reassuring stories might not be the most interesting for news editors , but the public deserves a more realistic picture of the problem of mrsa .

and some ' natural ' treatments , like black cohosh , can cause serious harm , says the drugs and therapeutics bulletin -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
but herbalists said a lack of proof did not mean the treatments lacked effect .
polls suggest 40 % of uk women have used complementary and alternative therapies for their menopausal symptoms .
common remedies include red clover , dong quai and evening primrose oil .
others include ginseng , wild yam extract , chaste tree , hops , sage leaf , and kava kava .
a lack of evidence does not necessarily mean a lack of effect jenny jones of the herb society the dtb says little good quality evidence on the effectiveness of these herbal medicines , or how they might react with prescription medicines is available .
there was some clinical trial data on black cohosh , but the results were " equivocal " , with some studies suggesting that the remedy works well , while others suggested that it did not relieve symptoms effectively .
and , in general , the safety of herbal remedies has been under researched , which is a major concern given that these products are often assumed to be " safe " just on the grounds that they are " natural , " says the dtb .
black cohosh in particular has been linked with liver damage , although this is rare .
published studies are often poorly designed , include too few participants , or do n't last long enough to be of real value , and the chemical make-up of various preparations of the same herb may differ , which can make it difficult to compare trial results , says the dtb .

gynaecologist dr nick panay , of the british menopause society , said : " some women will find herbal remedies beneficial .
we have been studying red clover isoflavones and have found they have a small benefit above placebo .
" but just because these are alternative treatments it does n't mean they are entirely safe .

the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is implementing tighter regulation of herbal medicines .
after april 2011 , all over-the-counter herbal medicines will have to be made to assured standards of safety , quality and patient information .
an ipsos mori poll for the agency shows that 77 % of adults agree that it is important that herbal medicines are regulated .

bbc news -pipe- health -pipe- herbal menopause cures lack proof bbc news / health graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- health contents : medical notes 07:28 gmt , wednesday , 14 january 2009 herbal menopause cures lack proof there is no convincing evidence that herbal remedies commonly taken to relieve troublesome menopausal symptoms actually work , say experts .
and some ' natural ' treatments , like black cohosh , can cause serious harm , says the drugs and therapeutics bulletin -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
but herbalists said a lack of proof did not mean the treatments lacked effect .
polls suggest 40 % of uk women have used complementary and alternative therapies for their menopausal symptoms .
common remedies include red clover , dong quai and evening primrose oil .
others include ginseng , wild yam extract , chaste tree , hops , sage leaf , and kava kava . "
a lack of evidence does not necessarily mean a lack of effect " jenny jones of the herb society the dtb says little good quality evidence on the effectiveness of these herbal medicines , or how they might react with prescription medicines is available .
there was some clinical trial data on black cohosh , but the results were " equivocal " , with some studies suggesting that the remedy works well , while others suggested that it did not relieve symptoms effectively .
and , in general , the safety of herbal remedies has been under researched , which is a major concern given that these products are often assumed to be " safe " just on the grounds that they are " natural , " says the dtb .
black cohosh in particular has been linked with liver damage , although this is rare .
published studies are often poorly designed , include too few participants , or do n't last long enough to be of real value , and the chemical make-up of various preparations of the same herb may differ , which can make it difficult to compare trial results , says the dtb .
" many patients do not tell their doctors that they are taking herbs .
healthcare professionals should ask women routinely if they are taking any such products , " says the dtb . "
some women will find herbal remedies beneficial " gynaecologist dr nick panay a survey of more than 1,000 women , published in menopause international in 2007 , found two-fifths had tried complementary and alternative therapies for menopausal symptoms such as hot flushes and night sweats .
jenny jones of the herb society said : " a lack of evidence does not necessarily mean a lack of effect .
not much clinical research has been done and we do need more .
but there is not the funding to do this type of work .
" as a practitioner i can tell you these remedies do work for some women . "
gynaecologist dr nick panay , of the british menopause society , said : " some women will find herbal remedies beneficial .
we have been studying red clover isoflavones and have found they have a small benefit above placebo .
" but just because these are alternative treatments it does n't mean they are entirely safe .
any treatment can carry side effects . "
jane gray , president of the national institute of medical herbalists , said : " in general , herbal preparations are extremely safe and possible side effects are generally mild - especially when compared to the possible side effects from a conventional treatment like hrt . "
the medicines and healthcare products regulatory agency is implementing tighter regulation of herbal medicines .
after april 2011 , all over-the-counter herbal medicines will have to be made to assured standards of safety , quality and patient information .
an ipsos mori poll for the agency shows that 77 % of adults agree that it is important that herbal medicines are regulated .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : tuesday 10.45pm ...
what is the eu 's point ?
what is it with meps and strasbourg ?
i 've just had a bite to eat with alyn smith , one of the snp 's two meps , in the meadow bar , a canteen area for staff with a bilious green carpet that is meant to represent an english meadow .
he neatly sums up the attitude of all the british meps i have met : " pretty much all of the meps are united in that they do n't want to come to strasbourg at all , " he says .
" it costs 200m odd euro a year .
it 's bad for carbon emissions .
we just do n't want to be in strasbourg .
we 've got a perfectly good hemicycle building that 's sitting in brussels that works fine and as a way of actually organising ourselves , i think at strasbourg you actually see us at our worst . "
strasbourg has symbolic value , as a town on the german border that was taken and re-taken during the second world war and it is also the home of the european court of human rights .
alyn smith 's theory is that the parliament continues to sit here because the eu officials , who mostly live in brussels , enjoy a trip out each month .
he also has an answer to the question asked by many of you - what is the point of the eu ?
" the eu is the best war avoidance mechanism ever invented .
it locks a number of countries that are more used to shooting at each other into constant , dull , technical negotiations . "
it looks like things are winding up in the chamber for the evening , so it 's time to head off .
i think i may be in danger of breaking the working time directive ...
tuesday 10.00pm if you think the european parliament is a minefield of strange terms and obscure groupings , try the round table .
i had lunch earlier with members of the shirley late knighters , a branch of the 41 club from the west midlands - an association for former members of the round table who have surpassed its age limit .
they were also on a fact-finding mission to strasbourg , as guests of tory mep malcolm harbour .
i briefly became part of the tour when i was introduced as " the man from the bbc " and then instantly put my foot in it by calling them round tablers .
from solihull .
apologies accepted , they turned out to be a very friendly and well-informed bunch .
they got to meet meps from germany and france as well as the tory group and went away happy with what they had seen , clutching european parliament goodie bags .
all good pr for the canny mr harbour .
tuesday 6.15pm ...
behind closed doors as several correspondents have pointed out , the real work gets done in brussels -lrb- every british mep you speak to is fed up with the monthly trek to strasbourg -rrb- .
the chamber is packed out for voting , but more sparsely populated the rest of the time .
there is a lot of activity going on behind closed doors , as the different party groups hammer out their differences .
i 've just sat in on a meeting between lib dem mep sharon bowles and representatives of the german government .
there is a stand-off between the european parliament and the council of ministers over the amount of capital insurance companies should be made to hold .
the germans , despite initially backing the council 's position may be shifting towards the meps ' view .
they were discussing tactics ahead of trialogue - a three way discussion between meps , the council and the commission .
these meetings can go on all day before an agreement is reached .
on one occasion they even carried on talking after the lights had gone out .
mrs bowles is a former european patent lawyer and seems to relish the technically complex nature of her brief .
she admits it is not stuff most of her constituents would easily understand , but it is something that is important to them , she insists , particularly in the current economic climate .
she is a shadow rappoteur for the liberal alde group on the insurance company solvency issue as well as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
she reckons this gives her the equivalent power of a junior minister at westminster .
your comments , questions and suggestions pesticides voting : it 's not that complicated so , with respect , do n't feed the beast by calling it so .
the commission -lrb- eg. an executive , like the government - albeit unelected but chosen by the elected governments -rrb- proposes a law -lrb- usually with the consent of the big beasts uk , france , germany -rrb- , the parliamentary committee responsible reviews it and proposes amendments -lrb- like house of commons committees -rrb- and , in the end after that bingo vote , the council of ministers -lrb- namely in this case our agriculture minister and 26 others -rrb- says yes or no to the compromise hammered out by the three institutions .
commission proposes , parliament amends , council decides .
by the way , any uk mep will have more impact on legislation than their equivalent mp simply because they can guide a law through .
try doing that in the house of commons .
pedro , liverpool when is this ridiculous junket going to end ?
please someone in europe have the guts to tell the french that strasbourg parliament has got to be scrapped .
brussels is bad enough but to have two parliaments is outrageous .
brian , haywards heath , uk the european parliament building is located in the hub of european democracy , and there are no factories nearby so i do n't know where the reporter saw an " industrial estate " .
it is next to the council of europe , the european court of human rights , the european pharmacopoeia , the alsace regional council and within a stone 's throw of all major permanent representations and embassies .
hardly what one imagines when referring to an " industrial estate " , i would think .
chloe this is a really good idea for a feature , but readers should bear in mind that to see the european parliament at its most interesting - and where almost all its real decisions are made - you should do a parallel feature on a committee week in brussels .
it 's less glamorous than a trip to strasbourg , but it 's also where you 'll get to see meps debating legislation in depth , taking political stances , defending their constituencies and making international , cross-party alliances .
alex , uxbridge , uk tuesday 3pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
voting .
or bingo ?
i witnessed my first voting session earlier .
very strange .
the chamber was packed , with the meps - including robert kilroy-silk making a very rare appearance , sitting in the non-aligned section with jean marie le pen et al - parked behind their computer screens in semi-circular rows .
the whole thing happens at breakneck speed , with the vice president of the parliament calling out the different amendments -lrb- " vote is open , has everyone voted ? vote is closed " -rrb- , which flashed up on a giant screen as they scrolled through .
it was like a giant bingo game - and very difficult for the uninitiated -lrb- i.e. me -rrb- to work out what was going on .
the conservatives lost their attempt to limit the extent of a ban on pesticides .
but that was expected .
the voting process is , as conservative mep malcolm harbour said to me earlier , really just a piece of political theatre .
the real decisions are made in the group meetings and committees in brussels .
but whatever you do , do n't say the meps are just rubber-stamping legislation by the european commission .
that is the quickest way to upset an mep , says mr harbour .
they have much more input into the final shape of the legislation than they used to , although it does still originate from the commission .
the pesticide legislation , which will ban the use of certain toxic chemicals on farms , originated back in july 2006 , when the european commission sent an initial legislative proposal to the european parliament for a first reading .
there was then a full year of committee hearings at the council of ministers , with officials from the different member states , including defra in the uk , battling it out to reach a " common position " .
then it was back to the european parliament for more wrangling between the meps and the ministers , before a second reading .
finally , there is more committee scrutiny by the meps before a common position is agreed on .
the party groups then put down amendments and decided which way they were going to vote .
a rappoteur , in this case a german green mep , is in charge of steering the legislation through the european parliament and it is they , rather than the party group leaders , who wield the real influence over legislation .
it is a tortuous process , and although the meps have significant input into the final legislation , it is the council of ministers , which is not directly elected , who have the real power .
the pesticide legislation is in the form of a directive , which means it will have to be incorporated into uk law , and that of other member states , although it is unlikely to come fully into effect until well into the next decade .
i hope that 's all clear ...
tuesday 2pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
ode to euro controversy it is 10 years since the euro was launched .
but instead of singing happy birthday , meps were treated to a rendition of beethoven 's ode to joy , europe 's official anthem .
-lrb- i almost wrote national anthem - i think strasbourg is starting to get to me .
i must have a chat with someone from ukip soon -rrb- .
it is , we are told , the first time the tune has been played during a formal sitting of the european parliament , although it gets played all the time at ceremonial occasions , euro officianados tell me .
still , not everyone is filled with joy at the idea .
timothy kirkhope , the conservative group leader , thinks the playing of anthems in parliament is " a bit pompous " .
" it would be like playing the national anthem in the house of commons , " he tells me .
" i do n't mind the european flag being flown on various occasions , " he adds .
labour 's meps take a more relaxed view .
" for us it is not a big deal , " says one of their team .
" it is only controversial for the eurosceptics . "
but has there been an ode to joy stitch-up ?
the uk independence party are crying foul at the apparent last minute rescheduling of the anthem 's playing .
ukip and its friends in various other parties around europe , including some conservatives , were planning to sing the french national anthem , the marseillaise , during the beethhoven tune .
ukip singing the french anthem - how did that come about ?
" we originally planned to sing our own national anthems , but that would just be a cacophony , so we thought we are in france , it 's a tune everybody knows , so let 's sing that , " explains a ukiper .
but their plans were scuppered after the european parliament authorities decided to play the anthem at 12.20pm , after most of the meps had disappeared for lunch after voting , rather than at the 11.15am after the debate on the euro 's 10th anniversary .
" they were scared we would ruin it , " claims the ukip man .
this place is truly a madhouse .
tuesday 1030 -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
special occasion it 's a special occasion this morning - the tenth anniversary of the euro .
the head of the european central bank , jean claude-trichet , is addressing the parliament .
we are told there will be some sort of event after that .
hopes are running high in the press room that there might be a cake .
or at least something to photograph .
the other main event this morning is the vote on pesticides .
british farmers are up in arms about the plan to cut the use of some pesticides .
i am spending the morning with the conservative group , who will be voting against the pesticides plan and , i suspect , will probably not be breaking out the bubbly for the euro 's birthday .
your comments , questions and suggestions if the eu was serious about saving the planet and energy they would stop this charade of moving between brussels and strasbourg ; it is a nonsense rob , chesham , bucks i would like to correct david 's -lrb- st albans , herts -rrb- misconceptions about eu mobility rules .
britain does not have to offer access to anyone who asks for it .
that is simply not true .
only people who can find work within three months are entitled to stay and only people who have worked in britain are entitled to benefits , just like anyone else .
and the good thing is the same rules apply for uk citizens who want to work on the continent , which might come in useful with the current economic mess in britain .
so just think about the benefits of an open and free europe !
nicolaas , luxemburg great idea to look into the eu parliament .
i did n't even know there were speeches , much less they were limited to a minute .
not expecting much from that middle east resolution though .
jude kirkham , vancouver canada good journalism !
for the hat-trick , you should do a day in the life of a brussels ambassador - the permanent representative - and of a real eurocrat / euro-humphrey , a commission director general ... robert , brussels , belgium how come people are not aware of what the european union means and has meant - we live in europe in prosperity , peace and harmony .
anyone over 40 must remember the pathetic frontier controls and the other menacing inconveniences of traveling. have we all forgotten the wars we had ?
or the chaos the national governments made of their countries , especially when meddling with their currencies .
anyone keen for 16 % interest on their mortgage ?
or for good old protectionism , did you experience driving an austin marina ?
stop bashing europe , please .
jan willem , brussels , belgium what percentage of the last 20 laws that have passed into english law were formulated in the eu parliament ?
knowledge of this should demonstrate the importance or no of the eu parliament richard , london tuesday 8am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
strasbourg euro mps debated a planned crackdown on changes to pesticide rules -lrb- which , ironically , could devastate brussels sprout production -rrb- until 11pm on monday evening .
as in the house of commons the parliament was fairly sparsely populated - most meps do n't arrive until tuesday i 'm told - but this is an issue that british farmers have concerns about and their views were highlighted by british meps present .
the basic case is that some believe the pesticides could cause cancer and other serious health problems .
british farmers ' leaders - backed by labour and conservative meps - oppose the change saying the change could have a " devastating impact " on them .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs says the changes would harm food production " without noticeable benefit for human health " .
confusingly the vote did not take place at the end of monday 's debate .
i 'm told the vote actually happens later today .
i will be keeping an eye on all this - i 'm told that meps are likely to vote in favour of the pesticides curbs - and i will endeavour to explain whether or not the vote by meps means that the change is definitely going to happen , or whether it is just a ' symbolic ' demonstration of opinion .
read more about the pesticide vote .
thanks for all your e-mails so far .
on the issue of expenses , which a few of your brought up , i will try and get some answers out of the meps .
the ones i 've spoken to so far have more or less admitted the system needs to change but claim it will be tightened up after the next election .
later this morning , i 'm meeting timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group , which has had its own problems with expenses in recent months , so i 'll ask him about that .
some of you wanted to know what benefit we get from the eu .
again , i 'll try and get some answers on that one .
steven crawford thought it would be a better idea to send a member of the public to strasbourg rather than a " possibly already privileged bbc reporter " .
i am trying to come at this from an outsider 's perspective but hopefully my experience of covering politics in the uk will mean i can ask the right questions .

strasbourg has symbolic value , as a town on the german border that was taken and re-taken during the second world war and it is also the home of the european court of human rights .
alyn smith 's theory is that the parliament continues to sit here because the eu officials , who mostly live in brussels , enjoy a trip out each month .
he also has an answer to the question asked by many of you - what is the point of the eu ?
" the eu is the best war avoidance mechanism ever invented .
it locks a number of countries that are more used to shooting at each other into constant , dull , technical negotiations . "
it looks like things are winding up in the chamber for the evening , so it 's time to head off .
i think i may be in danger of breaking the working time directive ...
tuesday 10.00pm if you think the european parliament is a minefield of strange terms and obscure groupings , try the round table .
i had lunch earlier with members of the shirley late knighters , a branch of the 41 club from the west midlands - an association for former members of the round table who have surpassed its age limit .
they were also on a fact-finding mission to strasbourg , as guests of tory mep malcolm harbour .
i briefly became part of the tour when i was introduced as " the man from the bbc " and then instantly put my foot in it by calling them round tablers .
from solihull .
apologies accepted , they turned out to be a very friendly and well-informed bunch .
they got to meet meps from germany and france as well as the tory group and went away happy with what they had seen , clutching european parliament goodie bags .
all good pr for the canny mr harbour .
tuesday 6.15pm ...
behind closed doors as several correspondents have pointed out , the real work gets done in brussels -lrb- every british mep you speak to is fed up with the monthly trek to strasbourg -rrb- .
the chamber is packed out for voting , but more sparsely populated the rest of the time .
there is a lot of activity going on behind closed doors , as the different party groups hammer out their differences .
i 've just sat in on a meeting between lib dem mep sharon bowles and representatives of the german government .
there is a stand-off between the european parliament and the council of ministers over the amount of capital insurance companies should be made to hold .
the germans , despite initially backing the council 's position may be shifting towards the meps ' view .
they were discussing tactics ahead of trialogue - a three way discussion between meps , the council and the commission .
these meetings can go on all day before an agreement is reached .
on one occasion they even carried on talking after the lights had gone out .
mrs bowles is a former european patent lawyer and seems to relish the technically complex nature of her brief .
she admits it is not stuff most of her constituents would easily understand , but it is something that is important to them , she insists , particularly in the current economic climate .
she is a shadow rappoteur for the liberal alde group on the insurance company solvency issue as well as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
she reckons this gives her the equivalent power of a junior minister at westminster .
your comments , questions and suggestions pesticides voting : it 's not that complicated so , with respect , do n't feed the beast by calling it so .
the commission -lrb- eg. an executive , like the government - albeit unelected but chosen by the elected governments -rrb- proposes a law -lrb- usually with the consent of the big beasts uk , france , germany -rrb- , the parliamentary committee responsible reviews it and proposes amendments -lrb- like house of commons committees -rrb- and , in the end after that bingo vote , the council of ministers -lrb- namely in this case our agriculture minister and 26 others -rrb- says yes or no to the compromise hammered out by the three institutions .
commission proposes , parliament amends , council decides .
by the way , any uk mep will have more impact on legislation than their equivalent mp simply because they can guide a law through .
try doing that in the house of commons .
pedro , liverpool when is this ridiculous junket going to end ?
please someone in europe have the guts to tell the french that strasbourg parliament has got to be scrapped .
brussels is bad enough but to have two parliaments is outrageous .
brian , haywards heath , uk the european parliament building is located in the hub of european democracy , and there are no factories nearby so i do n't know where the reporter saw an " industrial estate " .
it is next to the council of europe , the european court of human rights , the european pharmacopoeia , the alsace regional council and within a stone 's throw of all major permanent representations and embassies .
hardly what one imagines when referring to an " industrial estate " , i would think .
chloe this is a really good idea for a feature , but readers should bear in mind that to see the european parliament at its most interesting - and where almost all its real decisions are made - you should do a parallel feature on a committee week in brussels .
it 's less glamorous than a trip to strasbourg , but it 's also where you 'll get to see meps debating legislation in depth , taking political stances , defending their constituencies and making international , cross-party alliances .
alex , uxbridge , uk tuesday 3pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
voting .
or bingo ?
i witnessed my first voting session earlier .
very strange .
the chamber was packed , with the meps - including robert kilroy-silk making a very rare appearance , sitting in the non-aligned section with jean marie le pen et al - parked behind their computer screens in semi-circular rows .
the whole thing happens at breakneck speed , with the vice president of the parliament calling out the different amendments -lrb- " vote is open , has everyone voted ? vote is closed " -rrb- , which flashed up on a giant screen as they scrolled through .
it was like a giant bingo game - and very difficult for the uninitiated -lrb- i.e. me -rrb- to work out what was going on .
the conservatives lost their attempt to limit the extent of a ban on pesticides .
but that was expected .
the voting process is , as conservative mep malcolm harbour said to me earlier , really just a piece of political theatre .
the real decisions are made in the group meetings and committees in brussels .
but whatever you do , do n't say the meps are just rubber-stamping legislation by the european commission .
that is the quickest way to upset an mep , says mr harbour .
they have much more input into the final shape of the legislation than they used to , although it does still originate from the commission .
the pesticide legislation , which will ban the use of certain toxic chemicals on farms , originated back in july 2006 , when the european commission sent an initial legislative proposal to the european parliament for a first reading .
there was then a full year of committee hearings at the council of ministers , with officials from the different member states , including defra in the uk , battling it out to reach a " common position " .
then it was back to the european parliament for more wrangling between the meps and the ministers , before a second reading .
finally , there is more committee scrutiny by the meps before a common position is agreed on .
the party groups then put down amendments and decided which way they were going to vote .
a rappoteur , in this case a german green mep , is in charge of steering the legislation through the european parliament and it is they , rather than the party group leaders , who wield the real influence over legislation .
it is a tortuous process , and although the meps have significant input into the final legislation , it is the council of ministers , which is not directly elected , who have the real power .
the pesticide legislation is in the form of a directive , which means it will have to be incorporated into uk law , and that of other member states , although it is unlikely to come fully into effect until well into the next decade .
i hope that 's all clear ...
tuesday 2pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
ode to euro controversy it is 10 years since the euro was launched .
but instead of singing happy birthday , meps were treated to a rendition of beethoven 's ode to joy , europe 's official anthem .
-lrb- i almost wrote national anthem - i think strasbourg is starting to get to me .
i must have a chat with someone from ukip soon -rrb- .
it is , we are told , the first time the tune has been played during a formal sitting of the european parliament , although it gets played all the time at ceremonial occasions , euro officianados tell me .
still , not everyone is filled with joy at the idea .
timothy kirkhope , the conservative group leader , thinks the playing of anthems in parliament is " a bit pompous " .
" it would be like playing the national anthem in the house of commons , " he tells me .
" i do n't mind the european flag being flown on various occasions , " he adds .
labour 's meps take a more relaxed view .
" for us it is not a big deal , " says one of their team .
" it is only controversial for the eurosceptics . "
but has there been an ode to joy stitch-up ?
the uk independence party are crying foul at the apparent last minute rescheduling of the anthem 's playing .
ukip and its friends in various other parties around europe , including some conservatives , were planning to sing the french national anthem , the marseillaise , during the beethhoven tune .
ukip singing the french anthem - how did that come about ?
" we originally planned to sing our own national anthems , but that would just be a cacophony , so we thought we are in france , it 's a tune everybody knows , so let 's sing that , " explains a ukiper .
but their plans were scuppered after the european parliament authorities decided to play the anthem at 12.20pm , after most of the meps had disappeared for lunch after voting , rather than at the 11.15am after the debate on the euro 's 10th anniversary .
" they were scared we would ruin it , " claims the ukip man .
this place is truly a madhouse .
tuesday 1030 -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
special occasion it 's a special occasion this morning - the tenth anniversary of the euro .
the head of the european central bank , jean claude-trichet , is addressing the parliament .
we are told there will be some sort of event after that .
hopes are running high in the press room that there might be a cake .
or at least something to photograph .
the other main event this morning is the vote on pesticides .
british farmers are up in arms about the plan to cut the use of some pesticides .
i am spending the morning with the conservative group , who will be voting against the pesticides plan and , i suspect , will probably not be breaking out the bubbly for the euro 's birthday .
your comments , questions and suggestions if the eu was serious about saving the planet and energy they would stop this charade of moving between brussels and strasbourg ; it is a nonsense rob , chesham , bucks i would like to correct david 's -lrb- st albans , herts -rrb- misconceptions about eu mobility rules .
britain does not have to offer access to anyone who asks for it .
that is simply not true .
only people who can find work within three months are entitled to stay and only people who have worked in britain are entitled to benefits , just like anyone else .
and the good thing is the same rules apply for uk citizens who want to work on the continent , which might come in useful with the current economic mess in britain .
so just think about the benefits of an open and free europe !
nicolaas , luxemburg great idea to look into the eu parliament .
i did n't even know there were speeches , much less they were limited to a minute .
not expecting much from that middle east resolution though .
jude kirkham , vancouver canada good journalism !
for the hat-trick , you should do a day in the life of a brussels ambassador - the permanent representative - and of a real eurocrat / euro-humphrey , a commission director general ... robert , brussels , belgium how come people are not aware of what the european union means and has meant - we live in europe in prosperity , peace and harmony .
anyone over 40 must remember the pathetic frontier controls and the other menacing inconveniences of traveling. have we all forgotten the wars we had ?
or the chaos the national governments made of their countries , especially when meddling with their currencies .
anyone keen for 16 % interest on their mortgage ?
or for good old protectionism , did you experience driving an austin marina ?
stop bashing europe , please .
jan willem , brussels , belgium what percentage of the last 20 laws that have passed into english law were formulated in the eu parliament ?

strasbourg euro mps debated a planned crackdown on changes to pesticide rules -lrb- which , ironically , could devastate brussels sprout production -rrb- until 11pm on monday evening .
as in the house of commons the parliament was fairly sparsely populated - most meps do n't arrive until tuesday i 'm told - but this is an issue that british farmers have concerns about and their views were highlighted by british meps present .
the basic case is that some believe the pesticides could cause cancer and other serious health problems .
british farmers ' leaders - backed by labour and conservative meps - oppose the change saying the change could have a " devastating impact " on them .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs says the changes would harm food production " without noticeable benefit for human health " .
confusingly the vote did not take place at the end of monday 's debate .
i 'm told the vote actually happens later today .
i will be keeping an eye on all this - i 'm told that meps are likely to vote in favour of the pesticides curbs - and i will endeavour to explain whether or not the vote by meps means that the change is definitely going to happen , or whether it is just a ' symbolic ' demonstration of opinion .
read more about the pesticide vote .
thanks for all your e-mails so far .
on the issue of expenses , which a few of your brought up , i will try and get some answers out of the meps .
the ones i 've spoken to so far have more or less admitted the system needs to change but claim it will be tightened up after the next election .
later this morning , i 'm meeting timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group , which has had its own problems with expenses in recent months , so i 'll ask him about that .
some of you wanted to know what benefit we get from the eu .
again , i 'll try and get some answers on that one .
steven crawford thought it would be a better idea to send a member of the public to strasbourg rather than a " possibly already privileged bbc reporter " .

what is the eu 's point ?
what is it with meps and strasbourg ?
i 've just had a bite to eat with alyn smith , one of the snp 's two meps , in the meadow bar , a canteen area for staff with a bilious green carpet that is meant to represent an english meadow .
he neatly sums up the attitude of all the british meps i have met : " pretty much all of the meps are united in that they do n't want to come to strasbourg at all , " he says .
" it costs 200m odd euro a year .
it 's bad for carbon emissions .
we just do n't want to be in strasbourg .
we 've got a perfectly good hemicycle building that 's sitting in brussels that works fine and as a way of actually organising ourselves , i think at strasbourg you actually see us at our worst . "

later this morning , i 'm meeting timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group , which has had its own problems with expenses in recent months , so i 'll ask him about that .
some of you wanted to know what benefit we get from the eu .
again , i 'll try and get some answers on that one .
steven crawford thought it would be a better idea to send a member of the public to strasbourg rather than a " possibly already privileged bbc reporter " .
i am trying to come at this from an outsider 's perspective but hopefully my experience of covering politics in the uk will mean i can ask the right questions .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : tuesday 10.45pm ...
what is the eu 's point ?
what is it with meps and strasbourg ?
i 've just had a bite to eat with alyn smith , one of the snp 's two meps , in the meadow bar , a canteen area for staff with a bilious green carpet that is meant to represent an english meadow .
he neatly sums up the attitude of all the british meps i have met : " pretty much all of the meps are united in that they do n't want to come to strasbourg at all , " he says .
" it costs 200m odd euro a year .
it 's bad for carbon emissions .
we just do n't want to be in strasbourg .
we 've got a perfectly good hemicycle building that 's sitting in brussels that works fine and as a way of actually organising ourselves , i think at strasbourg you actually see us at our worst . "
strasbourg has symbolic value , as a town on the german border that was taken and re-taken during the second world war and it is also the home of the european court of human rights .
alyn smith 's theory is that the parliament continues to sit here because the eu officials , who mostly live in brussels , enjoy a trip out each month .
he also has an answer to the question asked by many of you - what is the point of the eu ?
" the eu is the best war avoidance mechanism ever invented .
it locks a number of countries that are more used to shooting at each other into constant , dull , technical negotiations . "
it looks like things are winding up in the chamber for the evening , so it 's time to head off .
i think i may be in danger of breaking the working time directive ...
tuesday 10.00pm if you think the european parliament is a minefield of strange terms and obscure groupings , try the round table .
i had lunch earlier with members of the shirley late knighters , a branch of the 41 club from the west midlands - an association for former members of the round table who have surpassed its age limit .
they were also on a fact-finding mission to strasbourg , as guests of tory mep malcolm harbour .
i briefly became part of the tour when i was introduced as " the man from the bbc " and then instantly put my foot in it by calling them round tablers .
from solihull .
apologies accepted , they turned out to be a very friendly and well-informed bunch .
they got to meet meps from germany and france as well as the tory group and went away happy with what they had seen , clutching european parliament goodie bags .
all good pr for the canny mr harbour .
tuesday 6.15pm ...
behind closed doors as several correspondents have pointed out , the real work gets done in brussels -lrb- every british mep you speak to is fed up with the monthly trek to strasbourg -rrb- .
the chamber is packed out for voting , but more sparsely populated the rest of the time .
there is a lot of activity going on behind closed doors , as the different party groups hammer out their differences .
i 've just sat in on a meeting between lib dem mep sharon bowles and representatives of the german government .
there is a stand-off between the european parliament and the council of ministers over the amount of capital insurance companies should be made to hold .
the germans , despite initially backing the council 's position may be shifting towards the meps ' view .
they were discussing tactics ahead of trialogue - a three way discussion between meps , the council and the commission .
these meetings can go on all day before an agreement is reached .
on one occasion they even carried on talking after the lights had gone out .
mrs bowles is a former european patent lawyer and seems to relish the technically complex nature of her brief .
she admits it is not stuff most of her constituents would easily understand , but it is something that is important to them , she insists , particularly in the current economic climate .
she is a shadow rappoteur for the liberal alde group on the insurance company solvency issue as well as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
she reckons this gives her the equivalent power of a junior minister at westminster .
your comments , questions and suggestions pesticides voting : it 's not that complicated so , with respect , do n't feed the beast by calling it so .
the commission -lrb- eg. an executive , like the government - albeit unelected but chosen by the elected governments -rrb- proposes a law -lrb- usually with the consent of the big beasts uk , france , germany -rrb- , the parliamentary committee responsible reviews it and proposes amendments -lrb- like house of commons committees -rrb- and , in the end after that bingo vote , the council of ministers -lrb- namely in this case our agriculture minister and 26 others -rrb- says yes or no to the compromise hammered out by the three institutions .
commission proposes , parliament amends , council decides .
by the way , any uk mep will have more impact on legislation than their equivalent mp simply because they can guide a law through .
try doing that in the house of commons .
pedro , liverpool when is this ridiculous junket going to end ?
please someone in europe have the guts to tell the french that strasbourg parliament has got to be scrapped .
brussels is bad enough but to have two parliaments is outrageous .
brian , haywards heath , uk the european parliament building is located in the hub of european democracy , and there are no factories nearby so i do n't know where the reporter saw an " industrial estate " .
it is next to the council of europe , the european court of human rights , the european pharmacopoeia , the alsace regional council and within a stone 's throw of all major permanent representations and embassies .
hardly what one imagines when referring to an " industrial estate " , i would think .
chloe this is a really good idea for a feature , but readers should bear in mind that to see the european parliament at its most interesting - and where almost all its real decisions are made - you should do a parallel feature on a committee week in brussels .
it 's less glamorous than a trip to strasbourg , but it 's also where you 'll get to see meps debating legislation in depth , taking political stances , defending their constituencies and making international , cross-party alliances .
alex , uxbridge , uk tuesday 3pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
voting .
or bingo ?
i witnessed my first voting session earlier .
very strange .
the chamber was packed , with the meps - including robert kilroy-silk making a very rare appearance , sitting in the non-aligned section with jean marie le pen et al - parked behind their computer screens in semi-circular rows .
the whole thing happens at breakneck speed , with the vice president of the parliament calling out the different amendments -lrb- " vote is open , has everyone voted ? vote is closed " -rrb- , which flashed up on a giant screen as they scrolled through .
it was like a giant bingo game - and very difficult for the uninitiated -lrb- i.e. me -rrb- to work out what was going on .
the conservatives lost their attempt to limit the extent of a ban on pesticides .
but that was expected .
the voting process is , as conservative mep malcolm harbour said to me earlier , really just a piece of political theatre .
the real decisions are made in the group meetings and committees in brussels .
but whatever you do , do n't say the meps are just rubber-stamping legislation by the european commission .
that is the quickest way to upset an mep , says mr harbour .
they have much more input into the final shape of the legislation than they used to , although it does still originate from the commission .
the pesticide legislation , which will ban the use of certain toxic chemicals on farms , originated back in july 2006 , when the european commission sent an initial legislative proposal to the european parliament for a first reading .
there was then a full year of committee hearings at the council of ministers , with officials from the different member states , including defra in the uk , battling it out to reach a " common position " .
then it was back to the european parliament for more wrangling between the meps and the ministers , before a second reading .
finally , there is more committee scrutiny by the meps before a common position is agreed on .
the party groups then put down amendments and decided which way they were going to vote .
a rappoteur , in this case a german green mep , is in charge of steering the legislation through the european parliament and it is they , rather than the party group leaders , who wield the real influence over legislation .
it is a tortuous process , and although the meps have significant input into the final legislation , it is the council of ministers , which is not directly elected , who have the real power .
the pesticide legislation is in the form of a directive , which means it will have to be incorporated into uk law , and that of other member states , although it is unlikely to come fully into effect until well into the next decade .
i hope that 's all clear ...
tuesday 2pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
ode to euro controversy it is 10 years since the euro was launched .
but instead of singing happy birthday , meps were treated to a rendition of beethoven 's ode to joy , europe 's official anthem .
-lrb- i almost wrote national anthem - i think strasbourg is starting to get to me .
i must have a chat with someone from ukip soon -rrb- .
it is , we are told , the first time the tune has been played during a formal sitting of the european parliament , although it gets played all the time at ceremonial occasions , euro officianados tell me .
still , not everyone is filled with joy at the idea .
timothy kirkhope , the conservative group leader , thinks the playing of anthems in parliament is " a bit pompous " .
" it would be like playing the national anthem in the house of commons , " he tells me .
" i do n't mind the european flag being flown on various occasions , " he adds .
labour 's meps take a more relaxed view .
" for us it is not a big deal , " says one of their team .
" it is only controversial for the eurosceptics . "
but has there been an ode to joy stitch-up ?
the uk independence party are crying foul at the apparent last minute rescheduling of the anthem 's playing .
ukip and its friends in various other parties around europe , including some conservatives , were planning to sing the french national anthem , the marseillaise , during the beethhoven tune .
ukip singing the french anthem - how did that come about ?
" we originally planned to sing our own national anthems , but that would just be a cacophony , so we thought we are in france , it 's a tune everybody knows , so let 's sing that , " explains a ukiper .
but their plans were scuppered after the european parliament authorities decided to play the anthem at 12.20pm , after most of the meps had disappeared for lunch after voting , rather than at the 11.15am after the debate on the euro 's 10th anniversary .
" they were scared we would ruin it , " claims the ukip man .
this place is truly a madhouse .
tuesday 1030 -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
special occasion it 's a special occasion this morning - the tenth anniversary of the euro .
the head of the european central bank , jean claude-trichet , is addressing the parliament .
we are told there will be some sort of event after that .
hopes are running high in the press room that there might be a cake .
or at least something to photograph .
the other main event this morning is the vote on pesticides .
british farmers are up in arms about the plan to cut the use of some pesticides .
i am spending the morning with the conservative group , who will be voting against the pesticides plan and , i suspect , will probably not be breaking out the bubbly for the euro 's birthday .
your comments , questions and suggestions if the eu was serious about saving the planet and energy they would stop this charade of moving between brussels and strasbourg ; it is a nonsense rob , chesham , bucks i would like to correct david 's -lrb- st albans , herts -rrb- misconceptions about eu mobility rules .
britain does not have to offer access to anyone who asks for it .
that is simply not true .
only people who can find work within three months are entitled to stay and only people who have worked in britain are entitled to benefits , just like anyone else .
and the good thing is the same rules apply for uk citizens who want to work on the continent , which might come in useful with the current economic mess in britain .
so just think about the benefits of an open and free europe !
nicolaas , luxemburg great idea to look into the eu parliament .
i did n't even know there were speeches , much less they were limited to a minute .
not expecting much from that middle east resolution though .
jude kirkham , vancouver canada good journalism !
for the hat-trick , you should do a day in the life of a brussels ambassador - the permanent representative - and of a real eurocrat / euro-humphrey , a commission director general ... robert , brussels , belgium how come people are not aware of what the european union means and has meant - we live in europe in prosperity , peace and harmony .
anyone over 40 must remember the pathetic frontier controls and the other menacing inconveniences of traveling. have we all forgotten the wars we had ?
or the chaos the national governments made of their countries , especially when meddling with their currencies .
anyone keen for 16 % interest on their mortgage ?
or for good old protectionism , did you experience driving an austin marina ?
stop bashing europe , please .
jan willem , brussels , belgium what percentage of the last 20 laws that have passed into english law were formulated in the eu parliament ?
knowledge of this should demonstrate the importance or no of the eu parliament richard , london tuesday 8am -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
strasbourg euro mps debated a planned crackdown on changes to pesticide rules -lrb- which , ironically , could devastate brussels sprout production -rrb- until 11pm on monday evening .
as in the house of commons the parliament was fairly sparsely populated - most meps do n't arrive until tuesday i 'm told - but this is an issue that british farmers have concerns about and their views were highlighted by british meps present .
the basic case is that some believe the pesticides could cause cancer and other serious health problems .
british farmers ' leaders - backed by labour and conservative meps - oppose the change saying the change could have a " devastating impact " on them .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs says the changes would harm food production " without noticeable benefit for human health " .
confusingly the vote did not take place at the end of monday 's debate .
i 'm told the vote actually happens later today .
i will be keeping an eye on all this - i 'm told that meps are likely to vote in favour of the pesticides curbs - and i will endeavour to explain whether or not the vote by meps means that the change is definitely going to happen , or whether it is just a ' symbolic ' demonstration of opinion .
read more about the pesticide vote .
thanks for all your e-mails so far .
on the issue of expenses , which a few of your brought up , i will try and get some answers out of the meps .
the ones i 've spoken to so far have more or less admitted the system needs to change but claim it will be tightened up after the next election .
later this morning , i 'm meeting timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group , which has had its own problems with expenses in recent months , so i 'll ask him about that .
some of you wanted to know what benefit we get from the eu .
again , i 'll try and get some answers on that one .
steven crawford thought it would be a better idea to send a member of the public to strasbourg rather than a " possibly already privileged bbc reporter " .

" i do n't mind the european flag being flown on various occasions , " he adds .
labour 's meps take a more relaxed view .
" for us it is not a big deal , " says one of their team .
" it is only controversial for the eurosceptics . "
but has there been an ode to joy stitch-up ?
the uk independence party are crying foul at the apparent last minute rescheduling of the anthem 's playing .
ukip and its friends in various other parties around europe , including some conservatives , were planning to sing the french national anthem , the marseillaise , during the beethhoven tune .
ukip singing the french anthem - how did that come about ?
" we originally planned to sing our own national anthems , but that would just be a cacophony , so we thought we are in france , it 's a tune everybody knows , so let 's sing that , " explains a ukiper .
but their plans were scuppered after the european parliament authorities decided to play the anthem at 12.20pm , after most of the meps had disappeared for lunch after voting , rather than at the 11.15am after the debate on the euro 's 10th anniversary .
" they were scared we would ruin it , " claims the ukip man .
this place is truly a madhouse .
tuesday 1030 -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
special occasion it 's a special occasion this morning - the tenth anniversary of the euro .
the head of the european central bank , jean claude-trichet , is addressing the parliament .
we are told there will be some sort of event after that .
hopes are running high in the press room that there might be a cake .
or at least something to photograph .
the other main event this morning is the vote on pesticides .
british farmers are up in arms about the plan to cut the use of some pesticides .
i am spending the morning with the conservative group , who will be voting against the pesticides plan and , i suspect , will probably not be breaking out the bubbly for the euro 's birthday .
your comments , questions and suggestions if the eu was serious about saving the planet and energy they would stop this charade of moving between brussels and strasbourg ; it is a nonsense rob , chesham , bucks i would like to correct david 's -lrb- st albans , herts -rrb- misconceptions about eu mobility rules .
britain does not have to offer access to anyone who asks for it .
that is simply not true .
only people who can find work within three months are entitled to stay and only people who have worked in britain are entitled to benefits , just like anyone else .
and the good thing is the same rules apply for uk citizens who want to work on the continent , which might come in useful with the current economic mess in britain .
so just think about the benefits of an open and free europe !
nicolaas , luxemburg great idea to look into the eu parliament .
i did n't even know there were speeches , much less they were limited to a minute .
not expecting much from that middle east resolution though .
jude kirkham , vancouver canada good journalism !
for the hat-trick , you should do a day in the life of a brussels ambassador - the permanent representative - and of a real eurocrat / euro-humphrey , a commission director general ... robert , brussels , belgium how come people are not aware of what the european union means and has meant - we live in europe in prosperity , peace and harmony .
anyone over 40 must remember the pathetic frontier controls and the other menacing inconveniences of traveling. have we all forgotten the wars we had ?
or the chaos the national governments made of their countries , especially when meddling with their currencies .
anyone keen for 16 % interest on their mortgage ?
or for good old protectionism , did you experience driving an austin marina ?
stop bashing europe , please .
jan willem , brussels , belgium what percentage of the last 20 laws that have passed into english law were formulated in the eu parliament ?

strasbourg euro mps debated a planned crackdown on changes to pesticide rules -lrb- which , ironically , could devastate brussels sprout production -rrb- until 11pm on monday evening .
as in the house of commons the parliament was fairly sparsely populated - most meps do n't arrive until tuesday i 'm told - but this is an issue that british farmers have concerns about and their views were highlighted by british meps present .
the basic case is that some believe the pesticides could cause cancer and other serious health problems .
british farmers ' leaders - backed by labour and conservative meps - oppose the change saying the change could have a " devastating impact " on them .
the department for environment , food and rural affairs says the changes would harm food production " without noticeable benefit for human health " .
confusingly the vote did not take place at the end of monday 's debate .
i 'm told the vote actually happens later today .
i will be keeping an eye on all this - i 'm told that meps are likely to vote in favour of the pesticides curbs - and i will endeavour to explain whether or not the vote by meps means that the change is definitely going to happen , or whether it is just a ' symbolic ' demonstration of opinion .
read more about the pesticide vote .
thanks for all your e-mails so far .
on the issue of expenses , which a few of your brought up , i will try and get some answers out of the meps .
the ones i 've spoken to so far have more or less admitted the system needs to change but claim it will be tightened up after the next election .
later this morning , i 'm meeting timothy kirkhope , leader of the tory group , which has had its own problems with expenses in recent months , so i 'll ask him about that .
some of you wanted to know what benefit we get from the eu .
again , i 'll try and get some answers on that one .
steven crawford thought it would be a better idea to send a member of the public to strasbourg rather than a " possibly already privileged bbc reporter " .
i am trying to come at this from an outsider 's perspective but hopefully my experience of covering politics in the uk will mean i can ask the right questions .

the aim is to find out what they do and what they are for .
are they powerless and enjoying the ultimate gravy train or working round-the-clock to make the world a better place ?
he is shadowing meps from all the british parties with the hope of finding the answer .
follow his progress via regular despatches on this page : tuesday 10.45pm ...
what is the eu 's point ?
what is it with meps and strasbourg ?
i 've just had a bite to eat with alyn smith , one of the snp 's two meps , in the meadow bar , a canteen area for staff with a bilious green carpet that is meant to represent an english meadow .
he neatly sums up the attitude of all the british meps i have met : " pretty much all of the meps are united in that they do n't want to come to strasbourg at all , " he says .
" it costs 200m odd euro a year .
it 's bad for carbon emissions .
we just do n't want to be in strasbourg .
we 've got a perfectly good hemicycle building that 's sitting in brussels that works fine and as a way of actually organising ourselves , i think at strasbourg you actually see us at our worst . "
strasbourg has symbolic value , as a town on the german border that was taken and re-taken during the second world war and it is also the home of the european court of human rights .
alyn smith 's theory is that the parliament continues to sit here because the eu officials , who mostly live in brussels , enjoy a trip out each month .
he also has an answer to the question asked by many of you - what is the point of the eu ?
" the eu is the best war avoidance mechanism ever invented .
it locks a number of countries that are more used to shooting at each other into constant , dull , technical negotiations . "
it looks like things are winding up in the chamber for the evening , so it 's time to head off .
i think i may be in danger of breaking the working time directive ...
tuesday 10.00pm if you think the european parliament is a minefield of strange terms and obscure groupings , try the round table .
i had lunch earlier with members of the shirley late knighters , a branch of the 41 club from the west midlands - an association for former members of the round table who have surpassed its age limit .
they were also on a fact-finding mission to strasbourg , as guests of tory mep malcolm harbour .
i briefly became part of the tour when i was introduced as " the man from the bbc " and then instantly put my foot in it by calling them round tablers .
from solihull .
apologies accepted , they turned out to be a very friendly and well-informed bunch .
they got to meet meps from germany and france as well as the tory group and went away happy with what they had seen , clutching european parliament goodie bags .
all good pr for the canny mr harbour .
tuesday 6.15pm ...
behind closed doors as several correspondents have pointed out , the real work gets done in brussels -lrb- every british mep you speak to is fed up with the monthly trek to strasbourg -rrb- .
the chamber is packed out for voting , but more sparsely populated the rest of the time .
there is a lot of activity going on behind closed doors , as the different party groups hammer out their differences .
i 've just sat in on a meeting between lib dem mep sharon bowles and representatives of the german government .
there is a stand-off between the european parliament and the council of ministers over the amount of capital insurance companies should be made to hold .
the germans , despite initially backing the council 's position may be shifting towards the meps ' view .
they were discussing tactics ahead of trialogue - a three way discussion between meps , the council and the commission .
these meetings can go on all day before an agreement is reached .
on one occasion they even carried on talking after the lights had gone out .
mrs bowles is a former european patent lawyer and seems to relish the technically complex nature of her brief .
she admits it is not stuff most of her constituents would easily understand , but it is something that is important to them , she insists , particularly in the current economic climate .
she is a shadow rappoteur for the liberal alde group on the insurance company solvency issue as well as a member of the committee on economic and monetary affairs .
she reckons this gives her the equivalent power of a junior minister at westminster .
your comments , questions and suggestions pesticides voting : it 's not that complicated so , with respect , do n't feed the beast by calling it so .
the commission -lrb- eg. an executive , like the government - albeit unelected but chosen by the elected governments -rrb- proposes a law -lrb- usually with the consent of the big beasts uk , france , germany -rrb- , the parliamentary committee responsible reviews it and proposes amendments -lrb- like house of commons committees -rrb- and , in the end after that bingo vote , the council of ministers -lrb- namely in this case our agriculture minister and 26 others -rrb- says yes or no to the compromise hammered out by the three institutions .
commission proposes , parliament amends , council decides .
by the way , any uk mep will have more impact on legislation than their equivalent mp simply because they can guide a law through .
try doing that in the house of commons .
pedro , liverpool when is this ridiculous junket going to end ?
please someone in europe have the guts to tell the french that strasbourg parliament has got to be scrapped .
brussels is bad enough but to have two parliaments is outrageous .
brian , haywards heath , uk the european parliament building is located in the hub of european democracy , and there are no factories nearby so i do n't know where the reporter saw an " industrial estate " .
it is next to the council of europe , the european court of human rights , the european pharmacopoeia , the alsace regional council and within a stone 's throw of all major permanent representations and embassies .
hardly what one imagines when referring to an " industrial estate " , i would think .
chloe this is a really good idea for a feature , but readers should bear in mind that to see the european parliament at its most interesting - and where almost all its real decisions are made - you should do a parallel feature on a committee week in brussels .
it 's less glamorous than a trip to strasbourg , but it 's also where you 'll get to see meps debating legislation in depth , taking political stances , defending their constituencies and making international , cross-party alliances .
alex , uxbridge , uk tuesday 3pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
voting .
or bingo ?
i witnessed my first voting session earlier .
very strange .
the chamber was packed , with the meps - including robert kilroy-silk making a very rare appearance , sitting in the non-aligned section with jean marie le pen et al - parked behind their computer screens in semi-circular rows .
the whole thing happens at breakneck speed , with the vice president of the parliament calling out the different amendments -lrb- " vote is open , has everyone voted ? vote is closed " -rrb- , which flashed up on a giant screen as they scrolled through .
it was like a giant bingo game - and very difficult for the uninitiated -lrb- i.e. me -rrb- to work out what was going on .
the conservatives lost their attempt to limit the extent of a ban on pesticides .
but that was expected .
the voting process is , as conservative mep malcolm harbour said to me earlier , really just a piece of political theatre .
the real decisions are made in the group meetings and committees in brussels .
but whatever you do , do n't say the meps are just rubber-stamping legislation by the european commission .
that is the quickest way to upset an mep , says mr harbour .
they have much more input into the final shape of the legislation than they used to , although it does still originate from the commission .
the pesticide legislation , which will ban the use of certain toxic chemicals on farms , originated back in july 2006 , when the european commission sent an initial legislative proposal to the european parliament for a first reading .
there was then a full year of committee hearings at the council of ministers , with officials from the different member states , including defra in the uk , battling it out to reach a " common position " .
then it was back to the european parliament for more wrangling between the meps and the ministers , before a second reading .
finally , there is more committee scrutiny by the meps before a common position is agreed on .
the party groups then put down amendments and decided which way they were going to vote .
a rappoteur , in this case a german green mep , is in charge of steering the legislation through the european parliament and it is they , rather than the party group leaders , who wield the real influence over legislation .
it is a tortuous process , and although the meps have significant input into the final legislation , it is the council of ministers , which is not directly elected , who have the real power .
the pesticide legislation is in the form of a directive , which means it will have to be incorporated into uk law , and that of other member states , although it is unlikely to come fully into effect until well into the next decade .
i hope that 's all clear ...
tuesday 2pm -lrb- french time -rrb- ...
ode to euro controversy it is 10 years since the euro was launched .
but instead of singing happy birthday , meps were treated to a rendition of beethoven 's ode to joy , europe 's official anthem .
-lrb- i almost wrote national anthem - i think strasbourg is starting to get to me .
i must have a chat with someone from ukip soon -rrb- .
it is , we are told , the first time the tune has been played during a formal sitting of the european parliament , although it gets played all the time at ceremonial occasions , euro officianados tell me .
still , not everyone is filled with joy at the idea .
timothy kirkhope , the conservative group leader , thinks the playing of anthems in parliament is " a bit pompous " .
" it would be like playing the national anthem in the house of commons , " he tells me .
" i do n't mind the european flag being flown on various occasions , " he adds .

" for us it is not a big deal , " says one of their team .

this marks a 41.9 % increase on the previous year and is still growing fast , said the government-linked china internet network information centre .
the study also showed huge increases in the number of people in china accessing the internet through mobile phones .
the report by cinic also noted that internet use in the countryside was increasing faster than in the cities .
at the end of 2008 , the number of net users in china , which has a population of 1.3 billion , was almost the same as the entire population of the united states .
users in the countryside surged by 60.8 % year-on-year to 84.6 million , compared with much more modest growth of 35.6 % in the urban areas , the report said .
the cinic report said 117.6 million people accessed the internet using their mobile phones last year , up 133 % from 2007 .
students are the main strength of mobile internet users , the study said : 43.5 % of them use their mobile phones to read online news , download music , check email and perform a variety of other tasks .
3g boom china , with 633.8 million mobile phone users , last week issued long-awaited licences for third-generation -lrb- 3g -rrb- mobile phones to china mobile , china telecom and china unicom .
china 's internet use total users : 298 million year-on-year increase : 41.9 % mobile net users : 117.6 million internet penetration : 22.6 % " with the coming of the 3g era , wireless internet will have exponential growth , " cinic said in a statement accompanying the release of its report .
3g phones enable faster data transmission and services such as watching tv , playing online games , wide-area wireless calls and web surfing .
by 2011 , the three operators expect to start 3g services all over china , a move which analysts predict will spur further massive growth in mobile internet use .
as the categories of mobile internet services increase , charges have also been dropping fast .

china 's booming internet use comes despite the government 's tight grip on the web .
certain websites deemed politically sensitive are blocked ; these include the bbc 's chinese language news site , reporters without borders and some hong kong and taiwan sites .
access to sites offering diverse political opinions remains highly restricted , even as chinese intellectuals and activists regularly brave the constraints to post new statements .
the government is also targeting what it calls unhealthy content on the internet .
earlier this month , it launched a campaign to get rid of vulgar and pornographic content , targeting 19 websites and search engines it said had failed to remove unsuitable material .
authorities in beijing , meanwhile , actively use the internet to sway opinion , put across actions and ideas , and promote top leaders .

this marks a 41.9 % increase on the previous year and is still growing fast , said the government-linked china internet network information centre .
the study also showed huge increases in the number of people in china accessing the internet through mobile phones .
the report by cinic also noted that internet use in the countryside was increasing faster than in the cities .
at the end of 2008 , the number of net users in china , which has a population of 1.3 billion , was almost the same as the entire population of the united states .
users in the countryside surged by 60.8 % year-on-year to 84.6 million , compared with much more modest growth of 35.6 % in the urban areas , the report said .
the cinic report said 117.6 million people accessed the internet using their mobile phones last year , up 133 % from 2007 .
students are the main strength of mobile internet users , the study said : 43.5 % of them use their mobile phones to read online news , download music , check email and perform a variety of other tasks .

3g phones enable faster data transmission and services such as watching tv , playing online games , wide-area wireless calls and web surfing .
by 2011 , the three operators expect to start 3g services all over china , a move which analysts predict will spur further massive growth in mobile internet use .
as the categories of mobile internet services increase , charges have also been dropping fast .
china 's internet penetration is still low at just 22.6 % , leaving more room for rapid growth , cinic said .
constraints the study said 234 million people surfed the internet to read or watch news by the end of 2008 , a much higher estimate than recently made by the chinese academy of social sciences .

a survey by high fliers research of 100 firms found recruitment targets had been cut by 17 % for this year .
the economic downturn had particularly hit financial sector recruitment , with 47 % fewer graduate entry-level jobs .
the report says " swingeing cuts " in recruitment , after years of a buoyant jobs market , make it one of the worst years to graduate for two decades .
' campus panic ' " there is understandable panic on campus that this is shaping up to be one of the worst years of the last two decades to be graduating from university , " says martin birchall , managing director of market research company , high fliers research .
mr birchall warns that more applications from university leavers will be chasing fewer jobs .
" not only have vacancies been reduced substantially for those finishing university in 2009 , but it is now clear that many of last year 's entry-level jobs did not materialise either , leaving many graduates from the class of 2008 out of work too . "
but the survey found a more positive message from the public sector , with graduate jobs increasing by 51 % since 2007 .
the warning that graduates will face a more difficult time in chasing jobs follows a sustained expansion in graduate employment - with a shortage of suitably-qualified applicants having recently been a bigger problem than a lack of vacancies .
long-term changes in the economy have seen a growing demand for well-qualified staff , with a survey from the association of graduate recruiters -lrb- agr -rrb- in summer 2008 showing that graduate unemployment was at its lowest for five years .
change in graduate job vacancies 1991/92 was the last major recession which hit graduate recruitment hard 1999 saw an unusually dramatic fall in manufacturing 2002/03 the downturn was created by the dot.com collapse read graduates ' stories here that update from the agr , based on a survey of major employers , showed that the graduate jobs market appeared to be " weathering the storm " of the credit crunch .
but this latest research claims that a corner has been turned and that economic uncertainty is now threatening the jobs market .
it claims that half of leading employers are lowering recruitment targets - and that compared with 2007 this will mean a 6.7 % reduction in jobs available .
the research suggests that the biggest reductions in jobs will be in investment banking , retailing , accountancy and engineering .
earlier this week , the government announced plans for university leavers struggling to find jobs , including three-month paid internships to help graduates gain work experience .
a spokesman for the department of innovation , universities and skills said : " we recognise that graduates are not immune from the effects of the economic downturn , which is why we are developing real help and support , talking to major employers about ensuring graduates get experience of work and a chance to show what they can do .

a survey by high fliers research of 100 firms found recruitment targets had been cut by 17 % for this year .
the economic downturn had particularly hit financial sector recruitment , with 47 % fewer graduate entry-level jobs .
the report says " swingeing cuts " in recruitment , after years of a buoyant jobs market , make it one of the worst years to graduate for two decades .
' campus panic ' " there is understandable panic on campus that this is shaping up to be one of the worst years of the last two decades to be graduating from university , " says martin birchall , managing director of market research company , high fliers research .
mr birchall warns that more applications from university leavers will be chasing fewer jobs .
" not only have vacancies been reduced substantially for those finishing university in 2009 , but it is now clear that many of last year 's entry-level jobs did not materialise either , leaving many graduates from the class of 2008 out of work too . "
but the survey found a more positive message from the public sector , with graduate jobs increasing by 51 % since 2007 .
the warning that graduates will face a more difficult time in chasing jobs follows a sustained expansion in graduate employment - with a shortage of suitably-qualified applicants having recently been a bigger problem than a lack of vacancies .
long-term changes in the economy have seen a growing demand for well-qualified staff , with a survey from the association of graduate recruiters -lrb- agr -rrb- in summer 2008 showing that graduate unemployment was at its lowest for five years .
change in graduate job vacancies 1991/92 was the last major recession which hit graduate recruitment hard 1999 saw an unusually dramatic fall in manufacturing 2002/03 the downturn was created by the dot.com collapse read graduates ' stories here that update from the agr , based on a survey of major employers , showed that the graduate jobs market appeared to be " weathering the storm " of the credit crunch .
but this latest research claims that a corner has been turned and that economic uncertainty is now threatening the jobs market .
it claims that half of leading employers are lowering recruitment targets - and that compared with 2007 this will mean a 6.7 % reduction in jobs available .
the research suggests that the biggest reductions in jobs will be in investment banking , retailing , accountancy and engineering .
earlier this week , the government announced plans for university leavers struggling to find jobs , including three-month paid internships to help graduates gain work experience .
a spokesman for the department of innovation , universities and skills said : " we recognise that graduates are not immune from the effects of the economic downturn , which is why we are developing real help and support , talking to major employers about ensuring graduates get experience of work and a chance to show what they can do .

a survey by high fliers research of 100 firms found recruitment targets had been cut by 17 % for this year .
the economic downturn had particularly hit financial sector recruitment , with 47 % fewer graduate entry-level jobs .
the report says " swingeing cuts " in recruitment , after years of a buoyant jobs market , make it one of the worst years to graduate for two decades .
' campus panic ' " there is understandable panic on campus that this is shaping up to be one of the worst years of the last two decades to be graduating from university , " says martin birchall , managing director of market research company , high fliers research .
mr birchall warns that more applications from university leavers will be chasing fewer jobs .
" not only have vacancies been reduced substantially for those finishing university in 2009 , but it is now clear that many of last year 's entry-level jobs did not materialise either , leaving many graduates from the class of 2008 out of work too . "
but the survey found a more positive message from the public sector , with graduate jobs increasing by 51 % since 2007 .
the warning that graduates will face a more difficult time in chasing jobs follows a sustained expansion in graduate employment - with a shortage of suitably-qualified applicants having recently been a bigger problem than a lack of vacancies .
long-term changes in the economy have seen a growing demand for well-qualified staff , with a survey from the association of graduate recruiters -lrb- agr -rrb- in summer 2008 showing that graduate unemployment was at its lowest for five years .
change in graduate job vacancies 1991/92 was the last major recession which hit graduate recruitment hard 1999 saw an unusually dramatic fall in manufacturing 2002/03 the downturn was created by the dot.com collapse read graduates ' stories here that update from the agr , based on a survey of major employers , showed that the graduate jobs market appeared to be " weathering the storm " of the credit crunch .
but this latest research claims that a corner has been turned and that economic uncertainty is now threatening the jobs market .
it claims that half of leading employers are lowering recruitment targets - and that compared with 2007 this will mean a 6.7 % reduction in jobs available .
the research suggests that the biggest reductions in jobs will be in investment banking , retailing , accountancy and engineering .
earlier this week , the government announced plans for university leavers struggling to find jobs , including three-month paid internships to help graduates gain work experience .
a spokesman for the department of innovation , universities and skills said : " we recognise that graduates are not immune from the effects of the economic downturn , which is why we are developing real help and support , talking to major employers about ensuring graduates get experience of work and a chance to show what they can do .
