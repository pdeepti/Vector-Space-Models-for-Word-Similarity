both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .

leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .
" he makes players better , especially tactically , " club general manager dieter hoeness told kicker magazine , explaining one of the reasons for the successful season so far .
hertha hope to have captain arne friedrich back in defense after he missed germany 's 1-0 home defeat against norway with a back problem .
but striker marko pantelic remains a doubt after suffering knee and ankle injuries almost two weeks ago .
the serbian , whose future at the club remains in doubt , said he would be doing his best to be fit for the game .
" my ankle is ok but i still have some inflammation on the knee .
but i 'm ready to grit my teeth for hertha , " he said .
" this game will show us where we stand and will mean a lot for where we finish up at the end of the season . "
hoffenheim struggled last week when they snatched a late draw at bottom club borussia moenchengladbach and it still remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the loss of injured striker vedad ibisevic .
hildebrand expected back in goal for hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is back in training for hoffenheim 's title push timo hildebrand is expected to be back in goal for the visit of fifth-placed leverkusen , who were 5-2 winners over ralf rangnick 's side earlier in the season .
" we want to put that right and show that the team has developed since then , " rangnick told the club 's homepage .
rangnick can call again on brazilian attacking midfielder carlos eduardo following suspension and nigerian striker chinedu obasi who made a brief comeback following injury last week .
" we have the opportunity of putting a direct rival for the international positions nine points behind us , " rangnick said .
" leverkusen are aiming high and will be going out to win .
compared to our last games we will have to step up a gear . "

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .
adler made a hash of his tackle on senegal striker demba ba , earning himself a yellow card and conceded a penalty simultaneously with half an hour gone .
midfielder sejad salihovic made no mistake with the spot kick .
helmes on fire bildunterschrift : it 's been fun : hoffenheim have led the league since november but for how much longer ?
but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .
there were a few key passages of play for us , above all the goals just before and after half-time .
we must now show a strong reaction in stuttgart . "
difficult spell set to continue for hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick helmes punished hoffenheim twice hoffenheim 's magic could be over as they have won just once in their last five games and now have difficult away dates at rising vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund .

pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .

together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .

waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2009 scientists decode majority of neanderthal man 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man remains were first discovered in the german state of north-rhine westphalia less than half a gram of bone has been used to decode a large portion of the genome of neanderthal man , an extinct evolutionary relative to modern humans , scientists announced thursday , feb .
12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .
" she 's still in a holding pattern , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .
" she 's still in a holding pattern , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.02.2009 germany passes stimulus plan despite wary public großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the expanded package lead to growth ?
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .

but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .

as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .

ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "
drive technologies for tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has been experimenting with electric technology on its mini toshiba president atsutoshi nishida said that " the combined know-how of the two international technology groups volkswagen and toshiba will be an important step towards the drive technologies of tomorrow . "
zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .
industry experts , however , say that the first mass-produced electric car is still some 10 to 20 years away . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.02.2009 germany passes stimulus plan despite wary public großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the expanded package lead to growth ?
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .
" he makes players better , especially tactically , " club general manager dieter hoeness told kicker magazine , explaining one of the reasons for the successful season so far .
hertha hope to have captain arne friedrich back in defense after he missed germany 's 1-0 home defeat against norway with a back problem .
but striker marko pantelic remains a doubt after suffering knee and ankle injuries almost two weeks ago .
the serbian , whose future at the club remains in doubt , said he would be doing his best to be fit for the game .
" my ankle is ok but i still have some inflammation on the knee .
but i 'm ready to grit my teeth for hertha , " he said .
" this game will show us where we stand and will mean a lot for where we finish up at the end of the season . "
hoffenheim struggled last week when they snatched a late draw at bottom club borussia moenchengladbach and it still remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the loss of injured striker vedad ibisevic .

rangnick can call again on brazilian attacking midfielder carlos eduardo following suspension and nigerian striker chinedu obasi who made a brief comeback following injury last week .
" we have the opportunity of putting a direct rival for the international positions nine points behind us , " rangnick said .
" leverkusen are aiming high and will be going out to win .

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .
adler made a hash of his tackle on senegal striker demba ba , earning himself a yellow card and conceded a penalty simultaneously with half an hour gone .
midfielder sejad salihovic made no mistake with the spot kick .

but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .

waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .

pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .

" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .

waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .

waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .
" he makes players better , especially tactically , " club general manager dieter hoeness told kicker magazine , explaining one of the reasons for the successful season so far .
hertha hope to have captain arne friedrich back in defense after he missed germany 's 1-0 home defeat against norway with a back problem .
but striker marko pantelic remains a doubt after suffering knee and ankle injuries almost two weeks ago .
the serbian , whose future at the club remains in doubt , said he would be doing his best to be fit for the game .
" my ankle is ok but i still have some inflammation on the knee .
but i 'm ready to grit my teeth for hertha , " he said .
" this game will show us where we stand and will mean a lot for where we finish up at the end of the season . "
hoffenheim struggled last week when they snatched a late draw at bottom club borussia moenchengladbach and it still remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the loss of injured striker vedad ibisevic .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .

a teacher in germany has lost her job for sealing the mouths of little blabbermouths with tape . a primary school teacher in the state of saxony-anhalt who had had enough of a group of unruly children interrupting her class took a roll of packaging tape and sealed the mouths of seven chatterbox kids , according the mitteldeutsche zeitung daily .
reports say she even threatened her young charges if they tattled about her draconian measures at home .
but somebody did spill the beans , and the parents of the tykes called for the teacher 's head - figuratively , of course .
school authorities in halle agreed and on friday , they announced that the teacher would lose her job for her unconventional methods of class control .

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.02.2009 germany passes stimulus plan despite wary public großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the expanded package lead to growth ?
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.02.2009 afghan-born german gets life for honor killing of sister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : o. 's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the return of the bear : berlinale 2009 peruvian survivors ' tale takes home berlinale 's golden bear berlinale juror schlingensief wants films to touch the soul german cinema in good condition , says berlinale director kosslick golden bear still up for grabs in crowded field for best film film -pipe- 13.02.2009 this year 's berlin film festival had culinary message großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us food guru alice waters is part of the berlinale line-up us food activist alice waters will be helping choose the crème de la crème of films at this year 's berlinale , a festival with a section devoted to culinary cinema .
the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "

waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .

mostly from a working-class or rural background , the men - many of whom are aged between 40 and 60 - usually choose young women from poor rural areas such as the mekong delta region .
over fifty percent of their potential wives are under 21 .
marriage migration poverty appears to be one of the major reasons behind the trend .
patrick corcoran , the head of the international organisation for migration office in ho-chi-minh city , explains : “ most of these women see marriage migration as a way to a better life , a way to escape poverty or to help their impoverished family .
most of them are from small rural farm communities .
when you look at the numbers of vietnamese women , it is really quite staggering - 20,000 vietnamese brides to the republic of korea , over 100,000 brides to taiwan , over 20,000 to china . ”
many young brides hope to lead glamorous lives similar to those they have seen in korean and taiwanese tv dramas .
government help but their stories do not always have happy endings , says patrick corcoran .
“ most of these marriages are indeed successful or happy , depending on how you define happy .
but there have been documented cases of trafficking , domestic violence , spousal abuse , domestic servitude - you ’ ve got trafficking for sex-work in brothels , dead bondage situations . ”
by setting up a state-run matchmaking agency in ho-chi-minh city , the vietnamese government hopes to avoid such abuse and bring more transparency to the matchmaking process .
officials say the plan will help protect vietnamese women from violent partners or criminal organisations .
but protecting the brides is not only the responsibility of the vietnamese authorities .
their new home countries also need to address the issue .
lack of social support father manh hung runs a safe house near taiwan ’ s capital taipei , where abused vietnamese women can seek shelter .
“ the difficulties that the vietnamese brides have faced are the lack of social and governmental support from the taiwanese government , ” he says .
“ they don ’ t feel themselves accepted by this society .
many of them aren ’ t able to apply for the citizenship .
they want to apply for the citizenship because it is their only security – they have children here in taiwan .
as soon as they become a citizen , they are not afraid of being sent back to vietnam . ”
father manh hung thinks that the main issue is that most vietnamese brides are alienated when they go abroad because they barely speak the language and have little social contact .
they do not know their rights and they do not know whom to approach when problems occur .
but , in order to escape poverty at home , many young vietnamese women are willing to marry strangers and face an uncertain future in the hope eventually of having a better life . chi viet giang 13/02/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

13 , that niehoff , a severe diabetic , died thursday in a hamburg hospital of complications from a lung condition .
known to customers and the nation as hamburg domenica , niehoff was familiar across germany for the pride she took in her profession as well as tireless campaigning for the legalization and regulation of prostitution .
niehoff left prostitution in the 1990s to open her own bar , called domenica , in hamburg 's st. pauli district .
in her later years , she was also something of a social worker in the red-light district , opening her home and her heart to streetworkers and drug addicts .
as a prostitute , she was instantly recognizable for her hairstyle - a slick-backed bun - as well as her 48-inch bust and revealing outfits , which usually included a corset of some kind .
" what i have accomplished is that more about prostitution is discussed , " niehoff said in an interview last summer with die welt newspaper .
" that it wo n't be whispered about as much .
that girls can honestly say , ' i was in the milieu , but now i want out . " '
germany legalized prostitution in 2002 , and there are an estimated 400,000 registered prostitutes in the country . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "
drive technologies for tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has been experimenting with electric technology on its mini toshiba president atsutoshi nishida said that " the combined know-how of the two international technology groups volkswagen and toshiba will be an important step towards the drive technologies of tomorrow . "
zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .
industry experts , however , say that the first mass-produced electric car is still some 10 to 20 years away . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de crime -pipe- 13.02.2009 afghan-born german gets life for honor killing of sister großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : o. 's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .

as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .

a new survey blames the recession for exacerbating a serious doping problem for people in high-stress jobs .
some two million employees in germany take medication for workplace stress . according to a survey by insurer dak , about 800,000 german workers regularly take stimulants in order to enhance their performance on the job .

now that germany is also undergoing the worst recession in its post-war history , with massive job layoffs across the board , dealing with work stress and ways of coping with it is becoming even more topical .
academics especially prone to stress the survey looked at those engaged in jobs involving greater stress , less security and the pressure to achieve results .
academics in particular were prone to use medication to enhance their ability to combat fatigue and increase performance .

" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2009 scientists decode majority of neanderthal man 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man remains were first discovered in the german state of north-rhine westphalia less than half a gram of bone has been used to decode a large portion of the genome of neanderthal man , an extinct evolutionary relative to modern humans , scientists announced thursday , feb .
12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .

the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .

waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .

waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .

waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .
adler made a hash of his tackle on senegal striker demba ba , earning himself a yellow card and conceded a penalty simultaneously with half an hour gone .
midfielder sejad salihovic made no mistake with the spot kick .
helmes on fire bildunterschrift : it 's been fun : hoffenheim have led the league since november but for how much longer ?
but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .
there were a few key passages of play for us , above all the goals just before and after half-time .
we must now show a strong reaction in stuttgart . "
difficult spell set to continue for hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick helmes punished hoffenheim twice hoffenheim 's magic could be over as they have won just once in their last five games and now have difficult away dates at rising vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund .
the league leaders are now in danger of losing their place at the top for the first time since mid-november to bayern munich or hertha berlin on saturday .
they lead by just a point from bayern .

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .

" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2009 scientists decode majority of neanderthal man 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man remains were first discovered in the german state of north-rhine westphalia less than half a gram of bone has been used to decode a large portion of the genome of neanderthal man , an extinct evolutionary relative to modern humans , scientists announced thursday , feb .
12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .
" she 's still in a holding pattern , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "

waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.02.2009 germany passes stimulus plan despite wary public großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the expanded package lead to growth ?
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2009 scientists decode majority of neanderthal man 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man remains were first discovered in the german state of north-rhine westphalia less than half a gram of bone has been used to decode a large portion of the genome of neanderthal man , an extinct evolutionary relative to modern humans , scientists announced thursday , feb .
12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .

steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .

the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .
" he makes players better , especially tactically , " club general manager dieter hoeness told kicker magazine , explaining one of the reasons for the successful season so far .
hertha hope to have captain arne friedrich back in defense after he missed germany 's 1-0 home defeat against norway with a back problem .
but striker marko pantelic remains a doubt after suffering knee and ankle injuries almost two weeks ago .
the serbian , whose future at the club remains in doubt , said he would be doing his best to be fit for the game .
" my ankle is ok but i still have some inflammation on the knee .
but i 'm ready to grit my teeth for hertha , " he said .
" this game will show us where we stand and will mean a lot for where we finish up at the end of the season . "
hoffenheim struggled last week when they snatched a late draw at bottom club borussia moenchengladbach and it still remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the loss of injured striker vedad ibisevic .
hildebrand expected back in goal for hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hildebrand is back in training for hoffenheim 's title push timo hildebrand is expected to be back in goal for the visit of fifth-placed leverkusen , who were 5-2 winners over ralf rangnick 's side earlier in the season .
" we want to put that right and show that the team has developed since then , " rangnick told the club 's homepage .
rangnick can call again on brazilian attacking midfielder carlos eduardo following suspension and nigerian striker chinedu obasi who made a brief comeback following injury last week .
" we have the opportunity of putting a direct rival for the international positions nine points behind us , " rangnick said .
" leverkusen are aiming high and will be going out to win .
compared to our last games we will have to step up a gear . "

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .

they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .

" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "

's lawyers denied that he carried out an honor killing in a case described by prosecutors as an " honor killing , " an afghan-born man was sentenced on friday by a hamburg court to life in prison for having stabbed his own sister to death . in a crime that outraged germany , the 24-year-old , identified as ahmad-sobair o. , killed his sister morsal on may 15 , 2008 , a day after she approached welfare officials in hamburg for protection from her brother .
he said he had objected to the pretty schoolgirl 's lifestyle , her clothing , and her attempts to distance herself from her family .
the case gained nationwide attention , amid a controversy over whether muslim immigrants were importing the archaic central asian custom of honor killing to germany .
the term refers to a muslim daughter being executed by the males of her own family , who jointly decide she has disgraced the family 's honor through her sexual behavior .
however , muslim women have been killed by their families for things such as refusing to enter into an arranged marriage , wearing western clothing , or even on the basis of rumors about her behavior .
the defense rejected the honor-killing explanation , contending that the immigrant family had been simply dysfunctional .
o. admitted the stabbing after his arrest , but declined to testify in court .
a court-appointed psychologist said o. had a personality disorder that made his temper uncontrollable .
prosecutors , who had sought an exemplary sentence to deter future honor killings , asked in vain for the psychologist to be dismissed and a mistrial declared .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : morsal was stabbed to death in a hamburg parking lot defense lawyers welcomed the psychologist 's testimony .
they said o. killed his sister in a fit of sudden passion and did not deserve the most severe penalty .
defense lawyer thomas bliwier denounced the " politicking " in germany over the case .
witnesses said morsal and her brother had a relationship that was a mix of love and hatred , with the spirited , fun-loving girl refusing to bow to her domineering older brother .
defendant showed remorse in court morsal , who had won a civic prize for setting up a peer-counselling project at her school , had complained several times to youth-aid counsellors about her brother and parents .
the brother killed morsal after seeing her walking with boys and being told by his own friends that morsal would become a prostitute .
just before the trial ended , the defendant , who had several previous convictions for assault , suddenly burst into tears and sobbed that he had never meant to kill morsal .
" she was my own sister , " he shouted .
german campaigners against honor killings demonstrated outside the courtroom .
heidemarie grobe of the group terres des femmes insisted that morsal 's death fitted the honor-killing pattern .
" it 's fixed in the roles inside the families , " she said .
" the brother usually claims the monopoly of force over the sister . "
terre des femmes estimates 50 women have been killed in the past decade in germany for reasons of supposed honor . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 13.02.2009 germany passes stimulus plan despite wary public großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will the expanded package lead to growth ?
germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .
13 .
but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .
combatting protectionism " germany has a huge interest in ensuring that the world does not make the same mistakes it made in the 1930s when countries competed to introduce protectionist policies , " said steinbrueck .
" we will have to do everything to ensure history does not repeat itself , " he added , citing " buy american " pressures in the united states and a " put british workers first " movement in britain .
as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .
on monday , the european commission forecast that the german economy would contract by a further 2.3 percent by the end of this year , making the downward spiral the worst since the end of world war two .
disapproval of incentives for car buyers only one-quarter of those polled were confident that the stimulus package , which includes public spending on road and building projects , as well as benefits for new car buyers , would help to shore up the country 's economy . in a nation of enthusiastic motorists , where the auto industry has been especially hard hit by the world recession , nearly two-thirds of those surveyed said they even disapproved of the government 's plan to offer 2,500 euros to car buyers who ditch their old clunkers for more environmentally friendly vehicles .
about three-quarters of those polled said they had no plans to take up the offer , with only 11 percent saying they were even considering making use of such an incentive . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , has approved a 50-billion-euro -lrb- $ 64 billion -rrb- stimulus package aimed at lifting the country out of its worst postwar recession . chancellor angela merkel 's right-left coalition cobbled together the package last month after an initial 31-billion-euro rescue plan approved last year was attacked at home and abroad for being too small .
the majority of germans are skeptical that this second stimulus package will actually help shield europe 's largest economy from the global recession , according to a forsa survey released on wednesday , feb .

but finance minister peer steinbrueck came to the defense of the package , even while acknowledging that it forces germany to take on a huge amount of new debt .
" given the circumstances , we can not stimulate the economy without increasing our debt , " he said in an address to the bundestag .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrueck warned against protectionism steinbrueck also warned against rising protectionist tendencies to combat domestic job losses , adding that he would address the issue with his counterparts at a g-7 weekend meeting of the world 's richest industrial nations .

as the world 's top exporter , germany is more vulnerable to a rise in protectionism than other european countries .
steinbrueck 's address came on the heels of the announcement that the domestic economy in the final quarter of last year had contracted by 2.1 percent compared to the previous three months , leading to a downward spiral that marks 2008 as the worst performing year since german reunification in 1990 .
poll shows germans wary of stimulus package however , the survey by polling concern forsa , which was conducted for the weekly stern magazine , found that 69 percent of germans believe that the second stimulus package would not help germany to weather the economic slowdown .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "
drive technologies for tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has been experimenting with electric technology on its mini toshiba president atsutoshi nishida said that " the combined know-how of the two international technology groups volkswagen and toshiba will be an important step towards the drive technologies of tomorrow . "
zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .
industry experts , however , say that the first mass-produced electric car is still some 10 to 20 years away . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last weekend , bayern were the only side in the top five to win , after two late goals by miroslav klose gave them a 3-1 victory over borussia dortmund .
they have been playing catch-up all season , but are hoping they could on saturday go top for the first time this term .
" it 's only a matter of time .
we 'll pass them soon , " a confident coach juergen klinsmann said .
" we 've closed up to hoffenheim .
we 'll not leave them in peace now , and we want to overtake them in the next few weeks . "
hertha are themselves hoping to hit the summit after winning five of their last seven league games and gaining new-found consistency under swiss coach lucien favre .
" he makes players better , especially tactically , " club general manager dieter hoeness told kicker magazine , explaining one of the reasons for the successful season so far .
hertha hope to have captain arne friedrich back in defense after he missed germany 's 1-0 home defeat against norway with a back problem .
but striker marko pantelic remains a doubt after suffering knee and ankle injuries almost two weeks ago .
the serbian , whose future at the club remains in doubt , said he would be doing his best to be fit for the game .
" my ankle is ok but i still have some inflammation on the knee .
but i 'm ready to grit my teeth for hertha , " he said .
" this game will show us where we stand and will mean a lot for where we finish up at the end of the season . "
hoffenheim struggled last week when they snatched a late draw at bottom club borussia moenchengladbach and it still remains to be seen whether they can compensate for the loss of injured striker vedad ibisevic .

" we want to put that right and show that the team has developed since then , " rangnick told the club 's homepage .
rangnick can call again on brazilian attacking midfielder carlos eduardo following suspension and nigerian striker chinedu obasi who made a brief comeback following injury last week .
" we have the opportunity of putting a direct rival for the international positions nine points behind us , " rangnick said .
" leverkusen are aiming high and will be going out to win .
compared to our last games we will have to step up a gear . "

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .
adler made a hash of his tackle on senegal striker demba ba , earning himself a yellow card and conceded a penalty simultaneously with half an hour gone .
midfielder sejad salihovic made no mistake with the spot kick .

but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .
there were a few key passages of play for us , above all the goals just before and after half-time .
we must now show a strong reaction in stuttgart . "

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 13.02.2009 scientists decode majority of neanderthal man 's genome großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man remains were first discovered in the german state of north-rhine westphalia less than half a gram of bone has been used to decode a large portion of the genome of neanderthal man , an extinct evolutionary relative to modern humans , scientists announced thursday , feb .
12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .
" she 's still in a holding pattern , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

12 . the genome project was orchestrated by two teams , one from the max planck institute for evolutionary anthropology in leipzig and the other from us genome-sequencing firm 454 life sciences .
speaking at one of two simultaneous press conferences on the project 's results , head scientist svante paabo said the two teams had sequenced more than three billion sections , or 60 percent , of neanderthal dna .
initial analysis of the results has confirmed the teams ' belief that neanderthals , humanity 's closest known relative , contributed very little to the gene pool of modern humans .
" our data really shows if there was a contribution , it was very small .
it 's tiny , " paabo said .
he acknowledged , however , that a breakdown of the sequencing had so far confirmed that humans and neanderthals shared the same variant of the foxp2 gene known to play a role in speech .
" we can not say from this they could speak .
we can just say there is no reason to assume they could n't speak from what little we know , " paabo said .
the teams used bones from neanderthal skeletons found in croatia , spain , russia and germany .
paabo said the next step would be to compare the newly discovered genome with that of modern humans .
mankind 's evolutionary story bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neanderthal man is part of the human evolutionary story neanderthals lived in europe and parts of asia until about 30,000 years ago , when cro-magnon people , an ancestor of modern humans , began migrating into their territories .
the goal of the project is to identify areas in the genome where humans have undergone rapid evolution since the split from neanderthals : the genetic changes that define us as human , 454 said thursday in a statement on its web site .
this analysis is achieved by comparing the neanderthal reference to the human and chimpanzee reference genome sequences as well as to the genomic variation among humans today , the statement said .
" using the chimpanzee and human mitochondrial dna sequences -lrb- mtdnas -rrb- as reference points … the divergence date between human and neanderthal mtdnas is at 660,000 -lrb- plus or minus -rrb- 140,000 years , " the statement said .
' neanderthals could n't adapt ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : according to one theory , neanderthals were unable to adapt to a changing environment in bonn , germany , neanderthal specialist ralf schmitz said he expected these studies to reveal within 10 years how the two species were related .
he said the neanderthal genome " has been read , but not yet decoded . "
schmitz heads a team that is studying the original neanderthal bones discovered in 1856 in the neander gorge near duesseldorf in germany which led to the species ' name .
there is a museum at the site today .
he said he also expected key data on neanderthal metabolism using the dna data " within five to 10 years . "
this might explain why the neanderthals became extinct 30,000 years ago . one theory suggests they could not adapt to changes in food supplies and types in times of famine .
schmitz said genetic studies had not yet been conducted on a female neanderthal he discovered in 1997 at the neander site .
" she 's still in a holding pattern , " he said . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 13.02.2009 vietnam brides seek foreign grooms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many vietnamese women marry foreigners to escape poverty tens of thousands of vietnamese young women try to find a way out of poverty by marrying foreigners - especially men from south korea and taiwan .
an illegal but profitable matchmaking industry has emerged .
amid reports of human trafficking and abuse , the vietnamese government is now planning to open its own official matchmaking agency to protect vietnamese women overseas . all over east asia , there are magazine ads promoting “ five-day marriage holidays ” .
for some bachelors , it only takes five days to travel to vietnam , meet a number of eligible women and pick a future bride .
mostly from a working-class or rural background , the men - many of whom are aged between 40 and 60 - usually choose young women from poor rural areas such as the mekong delta region .
over fifty percent of their potential wives are under 21 .
marriage migration poverty appears to be one of the major reasons behind the trend .
patrick corcoran , the head of the international organisation for migration office in ho-chi-minh city , explains : “ most of these women see marriage migration as a way to a better life , a way to escape poverty or to help their impoverished family .
most of them are from small rural farm communities .
when you look at the numbers of vietnamese women , it is really quite staggering - 20,000 vietnamese brides to the republic of korea , over 100,000 brides to taiwan , over 20,000 to china . ”
many young brides hope to lead glamorous lives similar to those they have seen in korean and taiwanese tv dramas .
government help but their stories do not always have happy endings , says patrick corcoran .
“ most of these marriages are indeed successful or happy , depending on how you define happy .
but there have been documented cases of trafficking , domestic violence , spousal abuse , domestic servitude - you ’ ve got trafficking for sex-work in brothels , dead bondage situations . ”
by setting up a state-run matchmaking agency in ho-chi-minh city , the vietnamese government hopes to avoid such abuse and bring more transparency to the matchmaking process .
officials say the plan will help protect vietnamese women from violent partners or criminal organisations .
but protecting the brides is not only the responsibility of the vietnamese authorities .
their new home countries also need to address the issue .
lack of social support father manh hung runs a safe house near taiwan ’ s capital taipei , where abused vietnamese women can seek shelter .
“ the difficulties that the vietnamese brides have faced are the lack of social and governmental support from the taiwanese government , ” he says .
“ they don ’ t feel themselves accepted by this society .
many of them aren ’ t able to apply for the citizenship .
they want to apply for the citizenship because it is their only security – they have children here in taiwan .
as soon as they become a citizen , they are not afraid of being sent back to vietnam . ”
father manh hung thinks that the main issue is that most vietnamese brides are alienated when they go abroad because they barely speak the language and have little social contact .
they do not know their rights and they do not know whom to approach when problems occur .
but , in order to escape poverty at home , many young vietnamese women are willing to marry strangers and face an uncertain future in the hope eventually of having a better life . chi viet giang 13/02/09 send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "
drive technologies for tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has been experimenting with electric technology on its mini toshiba president atsutoshi nishida said that " the combined know-how of the two international technology groups volkswagen and toshiba will be an important step towards the drive technologies of tomorrow . "
zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .

" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .

both helmes goals were executed with ruthless finishing as hoffenheim were humbled at home for the first time at the rhein-neckar-arena which opened in january .
leverkusen took the lead after hoffenheim 's defense allowed bayer 's brazilian renato augusto to slide a cross into helmes who showed clinical finishing and buried his shot in the back of the net after three minutes .
hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .
but the home side fought back thanks to a helping hand from bayer 's germany goalkeeper rene adler .
adler made a hash of his tackle on senegal striker demba ba , earning himself a yellow card and conceded a penalty simultaneously with half an hour gone .
midfielder sejad salihovic made no mistake with the spot kick .
helmes on fire bildunterschrift : it 's been fun : hoffenheim have led the league since november but for how much longer ?
but hoffenheim fell further behind just before the half-time whistle when helmes again received a crisp pass in front of goal and made no mistake in beating former germany goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 3-1 at the break .
leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .
" we knew that we had to put our opponents on the back foot , " said bayer coach bruno labbadia .
" we wanted to be the first team to beat hoffenheim here and i am happy for the team that we achieved that .
it was important for us to know we can beat any team in the league .
" i told my team not to listen to the crisis talk .
it was not easy for the young team to play like this today .
i am very happy with the way we played , " labbadia added .
the loss to bayer ended hoffenheim 's league-best unbeaten home run ended after eight wins and two draws on a snowy night .
" we made too many mistakes .
that is not typical for our game , " said hoffenheim coach ralf rangnick . „ we conceded two goals in the first ten minutes .
there were a few key passages of play for us , above all the goals just before and after half-time .
we must now show a strong reaction in stuttgart . "
difficult spell set to continue for hoffenheim bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : patrick helmes punished hoffenheim twice hoffenheim 's magic could be over as they have won just once in their last five games and now have difficult away dates at rising vfb stuttgart and borussia dortmund .
the league leaders are now in danger of losing their place at the top for the first time since mid-november to bayern munich or hertha berlin on saturday .
they lead by just a point from bayern .
leverkusen rejoined the title race on 36 points with the big win a week after crashing 4-2 at home against stuttgart .

in a statement on thursday , feb.12 , the wolfsburg-based company said it hoped to push the development of future drive technologies in many fields and that more research and development would be needed , particularly for smaller but more powerful lithium-ion batteries .
" to further support our strong position , volkswagen is making lasting investments and offering cooperation to other companies , " said volkswagen chief executive martin winterkorn .
" one of the important building blocks here is the cooperation with toshiba . "
the drive units and " accompanying power electronics " developed would be used in vw 's planned new small family of vehicles that are still in the concept stage , the statement said .
vw said it aimed to be the first manufacturer to provide " an emissions-free , affordable and safe large-scale production electric vehicle . "
while vw wants to be the first manufacturer to offer an affordable , safe mass-produced electric car , winterkorn has warned that such a car would not be available right away .
" a considerable amount of research and development work still has to be carried out until we can produce the electric vehicle , " winterkorn was quoted as saying .
he added that research into lithium-ion battery technology was now being done with " further potential technological partners alongside toshiba . "
but winterkorn called the partnership with toshiba " a major step forward toward the development of series production electric vehicles for our customers . "
drive technologies for tomorrow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bmw has been experimenting with electric technology on its mini toshiba president atsutoshi nishida said that " the combined know-how of the two international technology groups volkswagen and toshiba will be an important step towards the drive technologies of tomorrow . "
zero-emission cars are a major goal for auto manufacturers , with all major brands working towards it .
germany , however , has lagged behind the trend for some time .
only recently have german carmakers presented projects , with both vw and daimler planning offers for 2010 and bmw testing an electric system with its mini brand .
industry experts , however , say that the first mass-produced electric car is still some 10 to 20 years away . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

hoffenheim were 2-0 down just eight minutes later when a goal-mouth scramble saw bayer captain simon rolfes stab his shot home .

leverkusen made sure of the three points when ex-germany defender gonzalo castro lobbed his header over hildebrand on 48 minutes .

13 , at the berlin film festival . germany ' 09 is the result of a collaboration between 13 german film producers , each asked to capture a personal impression of contemporary germany , in a film of up to 12 minutes in length . the resulting 150 minutes , subtitled " 13 short films about the state of the nation , " offer bleakly critical , yet also humorous portrayals of the german psyche , touching on issues that are rooted within the country 's history but also resonate beyond germany 's borders . " sick house , " by wolfgang becker -lrb- director of " goodbye , lenin ! " -rrb- , depicts germany as a crumbling hospital .
doctors argue about how to treat a dying crash victim , patients are held in endless lines and an expressionless man waits for a jolt to surge through the nation . german malaise is also prescribed a medical remedy in dany levy 's film " joshua , " in which the jewish protagonist takes a herbal concoction to combat his pessimism about the country 's future . the touchingly ironic film shows the medicine 's startling effect .
not only does the world immediately appear less glum , but the protagonist 's young son is sent on a flight of discovery across the capital , berlin . " preventive action , " by hans weingartner , is based on the true case of an academic who was spied on for 11 months , then arrested and treated as a terror suspect , despite a lack of compelling evidence . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress tilda swinton heads the jury at this year 's event weingartner says , in germany , " anti-terror laws are used systematically to collect information about people " who have never perpetrated a crime , thus reversing the presumption of innocence until proven guilty . fatih akin is deeply critical of the state in " being murat kurnaz . "
the film reenacts a newspaper interview with the turkish-german former guantanamo detainee who accused the german government of doing too little to secure his release . collective memory several of the short films deal with collective memory , without specifically touching on the trademark themes of nazism , world war two or former eastern germany , commonly associated with germany 's past . " the road we do n't walk together , " by dominik graf , features old buildings across germany , which bear testimony to the past .
they are all scheduled for demolition to make way for new , light buildings not burdened by history . the closing film , " seance , " by christoph hochhaeusler , describes a future moon colony where the memories are made public of the only person left with recollections of germany . other films include " fractur , " by hans steinbichler , about a man 's anger when the typeface of the frankfurter allgemeine newspaper changes . steinbichler , whose protagonist riesch beintl is an anagram of his own name , admits that he was deeply angered by the change in layout . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : director tom tykwer , right , and actor clive owen at an even for the film " the international " he says the film explores his surprising reaction , which he bases on the fact that in germany , despite the best education and upbringing , " we are all skilled anti-semites and racists . " " feierlich travels , " by tom tykwer -lrb- the international -rrb- , follows a business traveller through a world of globalized brands , and romuald karmakar 's ramses gives a glimpse of the life of a strip club owner in berlin . new demons " a democratic discussion at designated times , " by isabelle stever , shows how young pupils learn to resolve disputes through classroom discussions , and bias , by silke enders , is a snapshot of people 's lives at a children 's soup kitchen . the film sequence which , karmakar says , " can not be representative " in its scope , is completed by angela schanelec 's film first day , which captures timelessness in daybreak scenes across germany . the ensemble presents a country ready to bury the ghosts of the past , while encountering new demons troubling the collective psyche . at the opening press conference , a foreign journalist challenged the film 's directors to show the film internationally as it " could correct germany 's reputation abroad " . the international perception of germany , he says , " is far more positive than what is being shown in this film .

the united states urged " exceptional " measures as treasury secretary timothy geithner arrived for bilateral talks with several other top delegates from the seven leading industrialized nations .
" these extraordinary times call for exceptional and complementary measures by all , " geithner 's delegation said in a statement at the start of the two-day gathering of finance ministers and central bank heads .
" the secretary will encourage his counterparts to take strong actions to address macroeconomic and financial sector challenges . "
geithner was set to discuss his vast us financial stabilization plan , which received a skeptical reaction in the united states and has prompted calls for more details .
" there is still some need for more elaboration " on the us financial plan , canada 's finance minister jim flaherty told reporters in rome as ministers gathered for the g7 opening dinner on friday evening .
stimulus packages to come under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the g7 finance ministers start talking tough saturday the g7 officials were to kick off their main talks on saturday , comparing notes on stimulus packages and trying to forge a consensus on the next steps , including possible new rules for global finance .
" the first thing we need to do is make sure that our own financial systems in our countries are well regulated and therefore credible , " said flaherty , who was due to meet with geithner on saturday .
" then we need to have some sort of international cooperation where we have validation of that integrity of finance systems .
that 's going to be a major topic of conversation here . "
more measures of the crisis emerged on friday , with data showing the euro zone economy slumped by 1.5 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 and the european union joined it and several individual eu countries in recession .
" the growth figures we have been given today are not really a surprise but are underlining the seriousness of the situation , " said jean-claude juncker , head of the eurogroup of euro zone finance ministers .
" we do have the strong hope that in the last quarter of 2009 growth will be back and that in the course of 2010 the situation will greatly improve , but ... we have to live for a long period with the consequences of this crisis . "
protests and social unrest spreads bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests have been gathering strength all over the world as the ministers gathered , tens of thousands of people thronged a square in rome under a sea of red flags to protest against the economic crisis .
fresh data on friday showed italy too is deeper in recession than expected .
ahead of the talks , several delegates voiced alarm over protectionism , which they fear may undermine efforts to ease the downturn .
japanese finance minister shoichi nakagawa has warned that his g7 delegation would take a " resolute stance " against the " absolute evil " of protectionism - when countries take measures that favor their own economies at the expense of other .
nakagawa said on tuesday that the g7 nations - britain , canada , france , germany , italy , japan , and the united states - were expected to discuss a sensitive " buy american " clause in a pending us economic stimulus package .
meanwhile , france has fiercely defended its plan to pump billions of euros into its struggling auto sector against eu charges of protectionism .
the italian finance ministry said in a statement that as president of the talks it would take a stand against protectionism , push for " a minimum basic set of rules " on world financial regulation and discuss " food security issues . "
world bank president robert zoellick meanwhile told reporters here that the bank wants to persuade wealthy countries to set up a " vulnerability fund " to aid poor countries hit hard by the global financial crisis .
" i propose that developed countries agree to devote 0.7 percent of their stimulus packages to a vulnerability fund to support the most needy , " he said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new survey blames the recession for exacerbating a serious doping problem for people in high-stress jobs .
some two million employees in germany take medication for workplace stress . according to a survey by insurer dak , about 800,000 german workers regularly take stimulants in order to enhance their performance on the job . " this is an alarm signal for us , " said dak head herbert rebscher to the berliner zeitung daily on friday , feb .
13 . " those who take pills as a panacea to deal with every stressful situation have lost the ability to solve problems themselves , " he added .
now that germany is also undergoing the worst recession in its post-war history , with massive job layoffs across the board , dealing with work stress and ways of coping with it is becoming even more topical .
academics especially prone to stress the survey looked at those engaged in jobs involving greater stress , less security and the pressure to achieve results .
academics in particular were prone to use medication to enhance their ability to combat fatigue and increase performance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many doctors prescribe medications to cope with stress even children have n't been spared from prescription drugs used to treat attention deficit disorders or depression .
twenty percent of those surveyed were fully aware of the potential side effects of overdosing on prescription drugs , but said the benefits of medicating themselves outweighed the risks .
in 28 percent of all cases , the drugs were recommended by their doctor .
economic woes lead to more pill popping the fallout of the world financial crisis is likely to lead to greater insecurity and " a further increase in psychological problems in the world place , " according to the german trade union -lrb- dgb -rrb- , which is fighting the trend to treat problems with pill popping .
" the dfb is pushing for a reduction in work stress and setting guidelines for a more healthy culture in the workplace , " said the trade union for employees in a statement .
even the employers ' trade association bda is taking note . " the abuse of prescription drugs needs to be seen as a serious problem , " alexander gunkel , a bda spokesman , told the berliner zeitung .
the study is also being taken seriously by the german health ministry .
" we are looking very carefully at it , " spokesman klaus vater told the paper .
in 2008 the numbers of stress-related casualties in the workplace shot up . the number of sick days employees took off from work increased by nearly eight percent from the previous year . dw staff -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the restaurateur has come with her own clear message . a good film and a nice dinner are some of the ingredients that go into the culinary cinema section of the berlin international film festival .
after the screenings top german chefs serve a menu inspired by the films , and events are rounded off with discussions on culinary themes - completing , for some , the perfect evening .
food guru alice waters , a surprise choice on the eight-member international jury this year , is thrilled at the idea and has come to berlin with a message .
time for new approach to food bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : waters opposes factory farming and processed food " pay attention to what you eat everyday .
pay attention to what you put in your mouth and know where it comes from , " she says , chatting about her dreams of " bringing people into a new relationship to food . "
waters , who will help decide which movies will be honored in the berlinale this week , says festival director dieter kosslick is right when he talks of an " apocalyptic situation " in the food industry .
asked if things were really so bad , she answers : " i think it is because when you think about it , 40 per cent of the economy of this world has to do with food production .
" in fact , industrial farming and fast food operate hand in glove , very much like a vast conspiracy .
together they suppress variety , limit our choices , and manipulate our desires by getting us hooked on sugar and salt , " she argues .
waters has been appealing for change through the tastebuds since the 1960s , when she first began her push for organic and local food from her famous berkeley , california , restaurant chez panisse .
in 1994 , waters developed the edible schoolyard programme at the martin luther king jr .
middle school in berkeley .
using a vacant lot adjacent to the school , a garden was planted , with students given lessons in gardening and cooking .
there the children were taught the principles of ecology , and about nourishment , " not in a way that was didactic but in a way that was pleasurable , " she said in an interview .
" our aim was to bring them into a new relationship to food . "
the project was so successful that the idea soon spread to numerous other schools across the country .
waters wants us-wide diet scheme for kids bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's unlikely waters will try the berlin specialty , currywurst and chips now , waters wants a system introduced whereby all schoolchildren in america will be fed a breakfast , lunch and afternoon snack on a daily basis .
" if you set up strict criteria for the purchase of the food , a huge incentive will be given to local producers , " she says , adding another advantage could be " the huge economic boost for families . "
waters , whose chez panisse restaurant was named best restaurant in america by gourmet magazine in 2001 , and who has authored numerous books about cooking down the years , says robert kenner 's film " food inc " exposing the morass of the food industry , was a powerful choice to head off the 2009 berlin culinary cinema programme .
" in every state in the us there are corporations that are very involved in the production of food , " says waters , hinting some were " very powerful . "
to waters , food represents " an integral part of our civilization , " a part which she now fears is disappearing in a culture of fast , junk food consumerism .
she maintains it 's important for people to know where their meat comes from , how it 's produced and whether it is clean and fair .
" fair , " she says , " in the sense that fair wages are paid to the farmworkers and the people who produce it .
i do n't want to eat food that is grown in a way that is causing somebody elses starvation .
" i want to buy food from people who take care of the land , think of a big picture about nourishment .
and of course i want tasty , bright and seasonal food , " she continues .
born in chatham , new jersey in april 1944 , waters graduated from the university of california at berkeley in 1967 and later spent time studying abroad in paris .
in france , she says , " i discovered the intimate connection between food and the quality of one 's life . "
she took this knowledge back with her to california , opening up chez panisse in 1971 and later , in the ' 80s ' , cafe fanny , named after her daughter . dpa news agency -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

andrew way , chief executive of london 's royal free hospital , said technical problems had cost the trust £ 10m and meant fewer patients could be seen .
the department of health said lessons had been learnt from the trial .
the england scheme , part of a £ 12bn it upgrade , aims to put 50 million patient records on a secure database by 2014 .
the royal free , one of a number of early adopters of e-records , has been using the system since last summer .
the project , restricted to england , has been one of the most controversial aspects of the overall 10-year it programme , which also involves an online booking system , digital imaging for x-rays and electronic prescriptions .
mr way said the cost of the problems had meant the hospital had been unable to invest in new equipment .
he also said technical glitches had caused more work for staff and meant out-patients ' bookings were taking four times as long .
as a result , the hospital has had to employ another 40 administrative staff to handle the extra workload , he added .
the faulty system had also prevented the hospital from billing other parts of the nhs for treatment .
mr way said : " i think it is very disappointing that the work we had to do as a trust has caused our staff so much heart-ache and hard work .
" many of the medical staff are incredibly disappointed with what we have got .
" i have personally apologised for the decision to implement the system before we were really clear about what we were going to receive .
" i had been led to believe it would all work . "
however , he said he still believed in the idea of replacing paper records with an electronic system , but it would need more work to get it right .
improved care overall , the hospital has spent an extra £ 4m to get the system working .
on top of this , mr way estimates the royal free has lost £ 6m because of fewer patients and glitches with the system , meaning it was unable to bill other parts of the nhs for work done .
nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation , which represents most health service organisations , said : " this is n't the first hospital to have very significant problems with implementation .
e-records e-records should allow a patient 's medical records , currently held by gps , to be accessed by a range of nhs staff it is part of a 10-year , £ 12bn upgrade of the nhs it network , which will also see online bookings and e-prescriptions however there are fears about the confidentiality of patient records " hospitals need to be able to tailor what they have got to their needs , rather than being given this one-size-fits-all solution . "
michael summers , vice chairman of the patients ' association , said the failure of a trust 's it system potentially let patients down in many ways .
" for example , what happens is that their medical records get lost .
the patients have to wait longer for their treatment because of the muddle .
" and in some cases , operations are postponed or patients are - the wrong patients are led to the surgery . "
a department of health spokesman said : " many elements of the programme are complete , and patients and clinicians are now beginning to see the benefits these systems bring to improve patient care .
" we are learning lessons from the deployment at the royal free of cerner millennium , which now has an effective patient record system , and we expect these lessons to help us improve further deployments . "
prime minister gordon brown vigorously defended the nhs it project at a meeting of commons select committee chairmen on thursday .
he said : " for all the problems that a huge project like that has created , you can not say that that is not an advance . "

andrew way , chief executive of london 's royal free hospital , said technical problems had cost the trust £ 10m and meant fewer patients could be seen .
the department of health said lessons had been learnt from the trial .
the england scheme , part of a £ 12bn it upgrade , aims to put 50 million patient records on a secure database by 2014 .
the royal free , one of a number of early adopters of e-records , has been using the system since last summer .
the project , restricted to england , has been one of the most controversial aspects of the overall 10-year it programme , which also involves an online booking system , digital imaging for x-rays and electronic prescriptions .
mr way said the cost of the problems had meant the hospital had been unable to invest in new equipment .

he also said technical glitches had caused more work for staff and meant out-patients ' bookings were taking four times as long .
as a result , the hospital has had to employ another 40 administrative staff to handle the extra workload , he added .
the faulty system had also prevented the hospital from billing other parts of the nhs for treatment .
mr way said : " i think it is very disappointing that the work we had to do as a trust has caused our staff so much heart-ache and hard work .
" many of the medical staff are incredibly disappointed with what we have got .
" i have personally apologised for the decision to implement the system before we were really clear about what we were going to receive .
" i had been led to believe it would all work . "
however , he said he still believed in the idea of replacing paper records with an electronic system , but it would need more work to get it right .
improved care overall , the hospital has spent an extra £ 4m to get the system working .
on top of this , mr way estimates the royal free has lost £ 6m because of fewer patients and glitches with the system , meaning it was unable to bill other parts of the nhs for work done .
nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation , which represents most health service organisations , said : " this is n't the first hospital to have very significant problems with implementation .
e-records e-records should allow a patient 's medical records , currently held by gps , to be accessed by a range of nhs staff it is part of a 10-year , £ 12bn upgrade of the nhs it network , which will also see online bookings and e-prescriptions however there are fears about the confidentiality of patient records " hospitals need to be able to tailor what they have got to their needs , rather than being given this one-size-fits-all solution . "
michael summers , vice chairman of the patients ' association , said the failure of a trust 's it system potentially let patients down in many ways .
" for example , what happens is that their medical records get lost .
the patients have to wait longer for their treatment because of the muddle .
" and in some cases , operations are postponed or patients are - the wrong patients are led to the surgery . "
a department of health spokesman said : " many elements of the programme are complete , and patients and clinicians are now beginning to see the benefits these systems bring to improve patient care .
" we are learning lessons from the deployment at the royal free of cerner millennium , which now has an effective patient record system , and we expect these lessons to help us improve further deployments . "
prime minister gordon brown vigorously defended the nhs it project at a meeting of commons select committee chairmen on thursday .
he said : " for all the problems that a huge project like that has created , you can not say that that is not an advance . "

andrew way , chief executive of london 's royal free hospital , said technical problems had cost the trust £ 10m and meant fewer patients could be seen .
the department of health said lessons had been learnt from the trial .
the england scheme , part of a £ 12bn it upgrade , aims to put 50 million patient records on a secure database by 2014 .
the royal free , one of a number of early adopters of e-records , has been using the system since last summer .
the project , restricted to england , has been one of the most controversial aspects of the overall 10-year it programme , which also involves an online booking system , digital imaging for x-rays and electronic prescriptions .
mr way said the cost of the problems had meant the hospital had been unable to invest in new equipment .

he also said technical glitches had caused more work for staff and meant out-patients ' bookings were taking four times as long .
as a result , the hospital has had to employ another 40 administrative staff to handle the extra workload , he added .
the faulty system had also prevented the hospital from billing other parts of the nhs for treatment .
mr way said : " i think it is very disappointing that the work we had to do as a trust has caused our staff so much heart-ache and hard work .
" many of the medical staff are incredibly disappointed with what we have got .
" i have personally apologised for the decision to implement the system before we were really clear about what we were going to receive .
" i had been led to believe it would all work . "
however , he said he still believed in the idea of replacing paper records with an electronic system , but it would need more work to get it right .
improved care overall , the hospital has spent an extra £ 4m to get the system working .
on top of this , mr way estimates the royal free has lost £ 6m because of fewer patients and glitches with the system , meaning it was unable to bill other parts of the nhs for work done .
nigel edwards , of the nhs confederation , which represents most health service organisations , said : " this is n't the first hospital to have very significant problems with implementation .
e-records e-records should allow a patient 's medical records , currently held by gps , to be accessed by a range of nhs staff it is part of a 10-year , £ 12bn upgrade of the nhs it network , which will also see online bookings and e-prescriptions however there are fears about the confidentiality of patient records " hospitals need to be able to tailor what they have got to their needs , rather than being given this one-size-fits-all solution . "
michael summers , vice chairman of the patients ' association , said the failure of a trust 's it system potentially let patients down in many ways .
" for example , what happens is that their medical records get lost .
the patients have to wait longer for their treatment because of the muddle .
" and in some cases , operations are postponed or patients are - the wrong patients are led to the surgery . "
a department of health spokesman said : " many elements of the programme are complete , and patients and clinicians are now beginning to see the benefits these systems bring to improve patient care .
" we are learning lessons from the deployment at the royal free of cerner millennium , which now has an effective patient record system , and we expect these lessons to help us improve further deployments . "
prime minister gordon brown vigorously defended the nhs it project at a meeting of commons select committee chairmen on thursday .
he said : " for all the problems that a huge project like that has created , you can not say that that is not an advance . "

it follows warnings from finance minister andrew davies that the economic downturn could hit assembly government funding further .
it is feared budget cuts could reach an " unprecedented " £ 500m in 2010 .
but unison 's welsh secretary , paul o 'shea , has insisted that the public sector remains the " engine room " of the welsh economy .
" if communities lose public sector jobs , then people stop spending .
if people stop spending , then manufacturers stop making things - it 's a vicious circle , " said mr o 'shea .
" the public sector is the engine for recovery in this recession . "
his comments came after the finance minister told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme that the years of growing budgets to spend in wales were over .
he put the current assembly government budget growth at around 1.8 % , down from 7 % for the first four years of the assembly .
" the growth is slowing down , and in the future it may well be reductions , rather than growth , " said mr davies .
" clearly as finance minister i have been saying consistently for around 18 months now the years of plenty have come to an end , and we need to be planning for some lean years coming ahead . "
' no increase ' chancellor alistair darling announced in his pre budget report -lrb- pbr -rrb- that to pay for the increase in uk government spending to combat the downturn , value-for-money savings of £ 5bn would have to be found in 2010-11 . "
we now have real worries that it will be frontline services that face the brunt of cuts in wales " mark serwotka , pcsu if all of this was passed on to wales , it would mean a cut of up to £ 300m .
balancing the books on underspends for nhs capital projects in england could also sting the welsh health service to the tune of £ 75m .
welsh ministers have been told that , at a minimum , they will receive no increases to their budgets for 2010-11 .
mr davies has told the cabinet that the pbr has " set a challenge " for the assembly government .
banks but mark serwotka , general secretary of the public and commercial services union , said the assembly government should not automatically accept budget reductions .
" it is a matter of political priorities and political will , " said the union leader .
" there should be a united front with politicians in wales and unions to argue in westminster that the cuts should not be made . "
instead , mr serwotka said there should be increased investment in major public sector projects as a way of stimulating growth and jobs in wales .
" i think it resounds with the public that when it came to the banks and the financial system , they were able to find incredible amounts of money , " said mr serwotka .
" we now have real worries that it will be frontline services that face the brunt of cuts in wales , in health , education and social care .
" this is going to have a much bigger impact on the welsh economy . "
despite the downbeat assessment on future assembly government budgets , the finance minister said the labour-plaid cymru coalition was still committed to delivering its one wales programme .
he also said it was too early to talk about cuts to particular services .
' gimmicks ' but his comments have angered political opponents , both conservatives and liberal democrats .
conservative finance spokesman nick ramsay am said : " as the consequences of gordon brown 's recession hit wales , the labour-plaid government needs to prioritise spending on key areas instead of on expensive pet projects and gimmicks . "
kirsty williams , the welsh liberal democrat leader added : " by wasting money on gimmicks in times of plenty , the outcome of this is that wales will now face even longer waiting lists , less repairs to school buildings , council tax rises and all-round cuts in public spending . "

welsh ministers have been told that , at a minimum , they will receive no increases to their budgets for 2010-11 .
mr davies has told the cabinet that the pbr has " set a challenge " for the assembly government .
banks but mark serwotka , general secretary of the public and commercial services union , said the assembly government should not automatically accept budget reductions .
" it is a matter of political priorities and political will , " said the union leader .
" there should be a united front with politicians in wales and unions to argue in westminster that the cuts should not be made . "
instead , mr serwotka said there should be increased investment in major public sector projects as a way of stimulating growth and jobs in wales .
" i think it resounds with the public that when it came to the banks and the financial system , they were able to find incredible amounts of money , " said mr serwotka .
" we now have real worries that it will be frontline services that face the brunt of cuts in wales , in health , education and social care .

despite the downbeat assessment on future assembly government budgets , the finance minister said the labour-plaid cymru coalition was still committed to delivering its one wales programme .

conservative finance spokesman nick ramsay am said : " as the consequences of gordon brown 's recession hit wales , the labour-plaid government needs to prioritise spending on key areas instead of on expensive pet projects and gimmicks . "
kirsty williams , the welsh liberal democrat leader added : " by wasting money on gimmicks in times of plenty , the outcome of this is that wales will now face even longer waiting lists , less repairs to school buildings , council tax rises and all-round cuts in public spending . "

it follows warnings from finance minister andrew davies that the economic downturn could hit assembly government funding further .
it is feared budget cuts could reach an " unprecedented " £ 500m in 2010 .
but unison 's welsh secretary , paul o 'shea , has insisted that the public sector remains the " engine room " of the welsh economy .
" if communities lose public sector jobs , then people stop spending .
if people stop spending , then manufacturers stop making things - it 's a vicious circle , " said mr o 'shea .
" the public sector is the engine for recovery in this recession . "
his comments came after the finance minister told bbc wales ' dragon 's eye programme that the years of growing budgets to spend in wales were over .
he put the current assembly government budget growth at around 1.8 % , down from 7 % for the first four years of the assembly .
" the growth is slowing down , and in the future it may well be reductions , rather than growth , " said mr davies .
" clearly as finance minister i have been saying consistently for around 18 months now the years of plenty have come to an end , and we need to be planning for some lean years coming ahead . "

advertisement the new £ 3.5m scala cinema in prestatyn is state of the art , says manager chris bond a 90-year-old cinema is reopening its doors after a long-running community campaign .
the scala in prestatyn , denbighshire , was forced to close in december 2000 under the weight of repair bills .
but its screens will come to life again on friday , after £ 3.5m was spent turning it into an arts centre .
among those attending the celebrations will be pat smith , who has waited eight years to use cinema tickets she won in a raffle .
" my granddaughter came home from school with some raffle tickets , which i bought .
i won two tickets to admit me into the scala cinema , " explained mrs smith .
" she kept saying to me ' when are we going to the cinema - when will we go ? ' and she is still waiting . "
her original tickets were valid until 2001 , but the theatre shut its doors before she had chance to use them .
to see it close was devastating ... people have fought hard to get it open , and we need to use it pat smith her granddaughter is now 16 , but on this special occasion the new cinema says it will honour the old tickets .
the original scala first opened in 1913 , after taking over the town hall in prestatyn and could hold 400 people in its 1940s heydays .
the new arts complex boasts two digital film screen theatres , each seating 150 people , an it media centre , a cafe and bar .
' wow ' factor the success of the project is also a tribute to dedicated members of the prestatyn community who refused to accept that the scala would stay shut .
" when they threatened the fact that it was going to be disposed of , the people of the town were in uproar , " recalled sandra pitt , chairperson of friends of scala .
" we decided to set up a small group to get it back , which is what we have done .
" we thought they would just do up the old cinema and we would have it safe again .
" but now we 've got the ' wow ' factor .
it 's not just a cinema and theatre , there 's the it media room , the cafe bar - it 's a fantastic facility for such a small town .
pat smith will finally get to use her eight-year old scala tickets on friday " we never even dreamt of having this . "
the whole project has been funded by the assembly government , the arts council for wales , the foundation for sports and the arts , the uk film council , and both the town and county council .
on friday 's opening night , the cinema has decided to show the oscar-nominated disney animation bolt , and it will also be showing the award-winning slumdog millionaire in its first week .
of course , one of the first in the queue will be mrs smith , who is delighted to finally use her tickets won in the raffle .
" to see it close was devastating , and to see it open will be nice .
people have fought hard to get it open , and we need to use it , " she added .

sigard can tell aggressive voices from other loud noises a dutch company called sound intelligence carried out a two week long trial in a busy city centre street .
they stress that their system , called sigard , does not record conversations .
it listens not to what is being said but how it is being said .
at the company 's headquarters in the dutch city of amersfoort , bram kuipers explained that sigard was listening for the changes that affect the human voice in an aggressive situation .
" it 's a different state that you are normally in , " he said .
" you 're full of adrenalin and your voice gets distorted .
you start to scream and you try to impose on someone . "
identifying such changes comes naturally to the human brain .
but teaching a computer system to recognise the specific characteristics of aggression has taken more than a decade , building on research at the university of groningen .

bram kuipers explains how the system operates sound intelligence say sigard is able to discriminate between the sound of aggression and other , everyday loud noises like passing trucks and car horns .
kuipers demonstrated this by clapping his hands .
a display screen noted the sounds but took no action .
then he shouted aggressively .
this time an alarm sounded and a cctv camera spun round to look directly at the source of the shouting .
such systems are already in everyday use on the streets of several dutch towns and cities .
the company said it also has uses in potential flashpoints like prisons and benefits offices .
there are hopes eventually to sell sigard in other markets - hence the glasgow trial .
" we installed a couple of microphones in one of the main streets of glasgow , " kuipers said .
" it 's working .
we detected aggression and it 's currently under evaluation . "
i 'd rather people trialled them in a more open way so that people know what going to be out there patrick harvie msp sigard is one aspect of what can be considered the next generation of cctv technology .
other innovations are also on the market , among them talking cameras and systems to detect suspicious behaviour patterns .
but the co-leader of the scottish greens , patrick harvie msp , is sceptical of the spread of new surveillance technologies .
" it 's probably fair enough to trial them .
but i 'd rather people trialled them in a more open way so that people know what going to be out there and we all have a bit of control over it , " he said .
he thinks more visible solutions such as mobile cctv units are more effective in preventing violence .
meanwhile sound intelligence say they have yet to install a permanent sigard system in scotland .
but the next time you get the feeling big brother is watching you , perhaps he will be listening as well .

mr rolet has worked for banks including goldman sachs , credit suisse first boston and dresdner kleinwort benson before joining lehman in 2000 .

the details , for 2007 , show seven whitehall chiefs , including civil service head sir gus o 'donnell , went free to the wimbledon championships .
chief of the defence staff sir jock stirrup was among those attending .
business department permanent secretary sir brian bender declared 47 free meals during the period .
sir brian , due to retire next month , also went to wimbledon and other events including the derby and the chelsea flower show , as well as being wined and dined by some of the uk 's biggest companies .
sir gus attended the chelsea flower show as a guest of accountancy firm kpmg , wimbledon courtesy of the all england lawn tennis club and an england football match paid for by the fa .
' life training ' the report shows that he donated £ 300 to leukaemia research to cover the cost of the latter .
jonathan stephens , permanent secretary at the department of culture media and sport , went twice to wimbledon within five days .
dozens of civil servants are listed as having had meals provided by firms , public sector organisations and charities .
several attended ballet performances , rugby matches , dinner dances , foreign trips and bbc proms concerts .
beverley shears , director of human resources at the ministry of justice , went to a " life training " event hosted by tv hypnotist paul mckenna .
around 200 mandarins declared some 1,800 items in 2007 - making an average of nine events each .
the most prolific entertainers included oil giants such as shell and bp , financial and advisory firm kpmg , and banks such morgan stanley , goldman sachs and deutsche .
newspapers and the bbc also featured heavily in the 90-page list .
failed banks hbos and royal bank of scotland found the money to host key whitehall figures , as the government prepared to bail them out with billions of pounds in public funds .
rbs took gordon brown 's top foreign policy adviser , sir nigel sheinwald - now ambassador to the us - to lunch last january .
in february they dined home office permanent secretary david normington , and in may stood lunch for foreign office mandarin sir peter ricketts .
' transparency ' hbos invited the treasury 's director for international finance , stephen pickford , to a reception in october and then bought him dinner the following month .
a cabinet office spokesman said : " the decision to publish this list reflects the government 's continued commitment to openness and transparency .
" all hospitality received is in line with guidelines set out in the civil service code and civil service management code . "
asked about the statistics on civil servants ' hospitality , the prime minister 's spokesman said that officials , like journalists , needed to maintain their network of contacts outside their own departments .
shadow cabinet office minister francis maude welcome the publication .
" openness and transparency over gifts and interests are vital to ensure a culture of probity and high standards in public life , " he said .
" however , it speaks volumes that gordon brown is still stalling over publishing the latest register of ministers ' interests following the return of peter mandelson . "

a number of people were killed when militia attacked pro-democracy campaigners on 16 august 1819 .
in 2007 , campaigners won their battle for a plaque marking the fact people lost their lives in the massacre .
a previous blue plaque made no mention of casualties .

we want something that tells people what happened .
" we also want to be respectful .

a crowd of 60,000 campaigners gathered peacefully on st peter 's fields in 1819 to call for the right to vote .
but local militia on horseback charged the protesters and cut them down with sabres , leaving at least 11 dead and about 600 injured .
the actual number of people who were killed is a matter of historical debate , but the current plaque on the old free trade hall on peter street marks 15 deaths .

the " contemporary " work will be built as part of the redevelopment of st peter 's square in the city centre .
although designs are yet to be decided , paul fitzgerald , of the peterloo memorial campaign , said members were " thrilled " by the development .
a number of people were killed when militia attacked pro-democracy campaigners on 16 august 1819 .
in 2007 , campaigners won their battle for a plaque marking the fact people lost their lives in the massacre .
a previous blue plaque made no mention of casualties .
the latest memorial was revealed by manchester city council as part of a £ 165m revamp of its town hall complex .
we do n't want a really negative image of the bloodbath , but we do want it to celebrate the struggle for democracy paul fitzgerald , peterloo memorial campaign it followed a feasibility study to explore a programme of public art commissions across the city on the theme of radical manchester .
councillors will appoint an internationally renowned artist to create a " major statement about one of the most significant events in the city 's and the country 's history " .
mr fitzgerald , who has long campaigned for a fitting monument , said : " my initial reaction is : ' yes , fantastic . '
after all this time , after 200 years almost .
" we 'd want something that 's explanatory , that if you did n't know about peterloo - and lots of people in manchester do n't - then you would by the time you 'd looked at this thing .
" we do n't want to see any kind of abstract spirals of steel that represent the spirit of democracy .
we want something that tells people what happened .
" we also want to be respectful .
we do n't want a really negative image of the bloodbath , but we do want it to celebrate the struggle for democracy . "
a crowd of 60,000 campaigners gathered peacefully on st peter 's fields in 1819 to call for the right to vote .
but local militia on horseback charged the protesters and cut them down with sabres , leaving at least 11 dead and about 600 injured .
the actual number of people who were killed is a matter of historical debate , but the current plaque on the old free trade hall on peter street marks 15 deaths .

since it started circulating in october 2008 the conficker worm has managed to infect millions of windows computers .
the software giant is offering the cash reward because it views the conficker worm as a criminal attack .
" people who write this malware have to be held accountable , " said george stathakopulos , of microsoft 's trustworthy computing group .
he told bbc news the company was " not prepared to sit back and let this kind of activity go unchecked " .
" our message is very clear - whoever wrote this caused significant pain to our customers and we are sending a message that we will do everything we can to help with your arrest , " said mr stathakopulos .
arbor networks said as many as 12 million computers could be affected globally by conficker / downadup since it began prowling the web looking for vulnerable machines to infect in october .
malicious payload the conficker worm is a self-replicating program that takes advantage of networks or computers that have not kept up to date with windows security patches .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer it digs deep , setting up defences that make it hard to extract .
the worm can also spread via usb flash drives .
the worm slithers through networks by guessing usernames and passwords .
security specialists recommend hardening passwords by mixing in numbers , punctuation marks and capital letters .
the virus reports in to its creators for updates by visiting a web domain .
it generates the name of the domain itself using a complicated code which security firms have cracked to track the growth of the worm and block its progress .
malware such as downadup can be triggered to steal data or turn control of infected computers over to malicious hackers which pool them into larger armies of so-called botnets .
these networks of compromised machines can be used to send spam , as dead drops for stolen or pirated data and to launch attacks on other machines .
although downadup is widespread its creators have yet to activate its payload to steal data or launch other attacks .
it has caused costly headaches for network administrators dealing with users locked out of their accounts when the worm correctly guesses a password .
while microsoft says it does not know the intention of the worm 's creator , it wants to ensure it does not wreak any more havoc .
experts say users should have up-to-date anti-virus software and install microsoft 's ms08-067 patch - also known as kb958644 .
global response microsoft has also partnered with security companies , domain name providers , academia , internet companies such as aol and others on a co-ordinated global response to the worm .
millions of computers have been hit by conficker also included is the us department of justice and the department of homeland security .
" the best way to defeat potential botnets like conficker / downadup is by the security and domain name system communities working together , " said greg rattray , chief internet security adviser at the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- .
" icann represents a community that 's all about co-ordinating those kinds of efforts to keep the internet globally secure and stable . "
sasser worm in 2003 microsoft created its reward programme with $ 5m -lrb- £ 3.4m -rrb- in funding to help law enforcement agencies bring computer virus and worm authors to justice .
this reward for help in tracking the creators of downadup is the first time in four years that the company has put up some cash in response to a worm outbreak .
microsoft hopes its bounty has started the countdown to finding its creator " we have not seen this type of worm or one of its class since 2004 , " said mr stathakopulos .
in 2005 microsoft paid out $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 171,000 -rrb- to two individuals who helped identify the creator of the notorious sasser worm .
the author was arrested and sentenced by the german authorities .
rewards of $ 250,000 were offered over three other major computer worm threats known as blaster , mydoom and sobig worms .
those perpetrators have never been caught .

malicious payload the conficker worm is a self-replicating program that takes advantage of networks or computers that have not kept up to date with windows security patches .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer it digs deep , setting up defences that make it hard to extract .
the worm can also spread via usb flash drives .
the worm slithers through networks by guessing usernames and passwords .
security specialists recommend hardening passwords by mixing in numbers , punctuation marks and capital letters .
the virus reports in to its creators for updates by visiting a web domain .
it generates the name of the domain itself using a complicated code which security firms have cracked to track the growth of the worm and block its progress .
malware such as downadup can be triggered to steal data or turn control of infected computers over to malicious hackers which pool them into larger armies of so-called botnets .
these networks of compromised machines can be used to send spam , as dead drops for stolen or pirated data and to launch attacks on other machines .
although downadup is widespread its creators have yet to activate its payload to steal data or launch other attacks .
it has caused costly headaches for network administrators dealing with users locked out of their accounts when the worm correctly guesses a password .
while microsoft says it does not know the intention of the worm 's creator , it wants to ensure it does not wreak any more havoc .
experts say users should have up-to-date anti-virus software and install microsoft 's ms08-067 patch - also known as kb958644 .
global response microsoft has also partnered with security companies , domain name providers , academia , internet companies such as aol and others on a co-ordinated global response to the worm .
millions of computers have been hit by conficker also included is the us department of justice and the department of homeland security .
" the best way to defeat potential botnets like conficker / downadup is by the security and domain name system communities working together , " said greg rattray , chief internet security adviser at the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- .
" icann represents a community that 's all about co-ordinating those kinds of efforts to keep the internet globally secure and stable . "
sasser worm in 2003 microsoft created its reward programme with $ 5m -lrb- £ 3.4m -rrb- in funding to help law enforcement agencies bring computer virus and worm authors to justice .
this reward for help in tracking the creators of downadup is the first time in four years that the company has put up some cash in response to a worm outbreak .
microsoft hopes its bounty has started the countdown to finding its creator " we have not seen this type of worm or one of its class since 2004 , " said mr stathakopulos .
in 2005 microsoft paid out $ 250,000 -lrb- £ 171,000 -rrb- to two individuals who helped identify the creator of the notorious sasser worm .
the author was arrested and sentenced by the german authorities .
rewards of $ 250,000 were offered over three other major computer worm threats known as blaster , mydoom and sobig worms .
those perpetrators have never been caught .

since it started circulating in october 2008 the conficker worm has managed to infect millions of windows computers .
the software giant is offering the cash reward because it views the conficker worm as a criminal attack .
" people who write this malware have to be held accountable , " said george stathakopulos , of microsoft 's trustworthy computing group .
he told bbc news the company was " not prepared to sit back and let this kind of activity go unchecked " .
" our message is very clear - whoever wrote this caused significant pain to our customers and we are sending a message that we will do everything we can to help with your arrest , " said mr stathakopulos .
arbor networks said as many as 12 million computers could be affected globally by conficker / downadup since it began prowling the web looking for vulnerable machines to infect in october .
malicious payload the conficker worm is a self-replicating program that takes advantage of networks or computers that have not kept up to date with windows security patches .
it can infect machines via a net connection or by hiding on usb memory drives used to ferry data from one computer to another .
once in a computer it digs deep , setting up defences that make it hard to extract .
the worm can also spread via usb flash drives .
the worm slithers through networks by guessing usernames and passwords .
security specialists recommend hardening passwords by mixing in numbers , punctuation marks and capital letters .
the virus reports in to its creators for updates by visiting a web domain .
it generates the name of the domain itself using a complicated code which security firms have cracked to track the growth of the worm and block its progress .
malware such as downadup can be triggered to steal data or turn control of infected computers over to malicious hackers which pool them into larger armies of so-called botnets .
these networks of compromised machines can be used to send spam , as dead drops for stolen or pirated data and to launch attacks on other machines .
although downadup is widespread its creators have yet to activate its payload to steal data or launch other attacks .
it has caused costly headaches for network administrators dealing with users locked out of their accounts when the worm correctly guesses a password .
while microsoft says it does not know the intention of the worm 's creator , it wants to ensure it does not wreak any more havoc .
experts say users should have up-to-date anti-virus software and install microsoft 's ms08-067 patch - also known as kb958644 .

natural england says the inland site of old clay pits and wetlands is one of only eight in england to be designated as an sssi because of its bitterns .

arlan cruz calderon said his 13-year-old daughter , noriko , was too young to be left to fend for herself .
noriko was born and raised in japan and speaks only japanese but now faces being left behind or being deported .
her parents entered japan in the early 1990s with illegal passports and stayed undetected until two years ago when her mother was arrested and later released .
human rights activists have urged the government to let the family stay together .
news reports suggested that japan , which imposes tight controls on immigration , was likely to allow her to stay to complete her studies .
family divided ?
the daughter has made a public appeal to authorities not to split her family apart .
but justice minister eisuke mori , who oversees immigration , told reporters : " i have decided not to grant a special residential permit to the entire family . "
a leading human rights lawyer handling the case said the immigration bureau had told the parents they had until 27 february to choose a departure date .
the immigration authorities warned that noriko 's 36-year-old father could be detained if he refused to leave .
" we accept neither the deportation of the whole family nor sending back only the parents , " said lawyer shogo watanabe .
he said he would continue negotiating for the parents to be allowed to stay at least until the daughter was older .
noriko 's father said : " she is 13 years old .
she can not survive or protect herself alone . "
mr watanabe said about 500 families were in the same situation as the calderons .

inside an even harsher storm is brewing .
deutsche bahn is in deep trouble .
not only has the state-owned operator had to postpone a recent planned part-privatisation because of the financial crisis .
now it is also accused of spying on its own staff .
" i am so angry , i still ca n't believe that they were spying on their workers for so many years , " says one employee , who does not want to be identified , as he nervously looks around at the crowd outside the underground station at potsdamer platz .
although people 's faces were concealed by large woollen hats and scarves , it seemed as if he was scared that someone would recognise him .
" come around the corner , i can talk better there , " he says in a flustered voice as he rests his shoulder against a wall .
" i have worked at this company for the past 30 years , and i 've never experienced anything like this before .
they spied on workers and their relatives , and the managers thought they could get away with it .
" it 's outrageous .
this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , they just wanted to keep an eye on all the workers here . "
secret agents the scandal just will not go away .
german members of parliament from across the political spectrum are baying for blood and newspaper commentators are having a field day .
" the bahn has lost track of reality , " ran one headline .
the affair has all the ingredients of a james bond film .
it involves covert surveillance operations that were given exotic code names such as " babylon " , " traviata " or " prometheus " as well as a private detective agency .
deutsche bahn has admitted that it conducted a surveillance operation on its staff on five separate occasions , dating back to 1998 .
the official aim of the vetting scheme was to root out corruption .
investigators and a berlin detective agency were hired to carry out the job .
extensive surveillance in a country with a history of state surveillance , such as under the nazis and communist east germany , it is hardly surprising that germans were shocked by the latest revelations . "
they were stupid and clumsy " deutsche bahn employee deutsche bahn has submitted a 37-page report to the german government and parliament .
in the report , the bahn admits that three major screenings took place in 1998 , 2002/3 and 2005/6 .
the names , addresses , telephone numbers and bank details of staff were compared with those of suppliers to detect possible illicit transactions .
under the codename " project babylon " , some 173,000 employees of deutsche bahn were vetted from 2002/3 and their personal details were compared with 80,000 suppliers .
on top of this , deutsche bahn has now acknowledged that it screened its managers and their relatives on two other occasions , in 2003/4 and 2005-6 , under the so-called " project squirrel . "
not informed many bahn employees feel disillusioned with the company . "
this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that " klaus-dieter hommel , gdba trade union " i don ´ t feel happy about working here , " says one .
" of course , the top managers knew what was going on .
it 's totally unacceptable .
" they were stupid and clumsy . "
the unravelling of deutsche bahn 's activities has turned into the biggest scandal in the company 's history and the atmosphere within the company is said to be " highly tense " .
the spying scandal is threatening to topple the truculent chief executive , hartmut mehdorn .
employee representatives are furious , insisting they were not informed of the surveillance operation .
" i 'm shocked and disgusted at the company culture here , " says klaus-dieter hommel , from the gdba trade union , shaking his head .
" did they think that this kind of surveillance was normal ?
they totally ignored workers ' rights and their privacy .
" this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that . "
raises questions under increasing pressure from the unions , mr mehdorn finally sent a letter to deutsche bahn employees apologising for giving investigators access to personal data . "
it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible " transport minister wolfgang tiefensee but his belated apology was quickly dismissed by parliamentarians .
horst friedrich , the transport spokesman for the liberal fdp party , has condemned the bahn 's handling of the affair as " salami tactics " insisting " the government must clear up this issue " .
even transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says he is not satisfied with deutsche bahn 's report .
" it raises more questions than it answers , " he says , looking ashen-faced and stunned after emerging from a parliamentary transport commission meeting .
" it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible . "
deutsche bahn 's senior managers insist they were not informed about what was going on .
but the unions remain sceptical and there are now growing calls for mr mehdorn to step down , though chancellor angela merkel is standing by him .
legal or illegal ?
berlin 's data protection commissioner and prosecutors are currently conducting an investigation into the affair over any breaches of data protection .
although there 's talk of a legal " grey area " , some lawyers are convinced that deutsche bahn 's actions were illegal .
" this does not correspond with german law , " says monika birnbaum , an employment lawyer at the firm , schwarz kelwing wicke westpfahl .
" screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies is in accordance with german data protection law only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree with this beforehand .
" as far as we know , these criteria were not fulfilled , so the screening was contrary to labour law and data protection law . "
but the railway operator insists the practices were legal , although there is a caveat .
" according to what we know , the screening was legal , " a spokesman for deutsche bahn says .
" the screening was carried out to fight corruption .
" however , the question does arise as to whether german data protection law was properly recognised especially because no information was forwarded to the supervisory board and to employee representatives . "
mr mehdorn has been invited by mps to give evidence at the german parliament 's transport commission on 4 march .
he should expect a hostile reception .

in the report , the bahn admits that three major screenings took place in 1998 , 2002/3 and 2005/6 .
the names , addresses , telephone numbers and bank details of staff were compared with those of suppliers to detect possible illicit transactions .
under the codename " project babylon " , some 173,000 employees of deutsche bahn were vetted from 2002/3 and their personal details were compared with 80,000 suppliers .
on top of this , deutsche bahn has now acknowledged that it screened its managers and their relatives on two other occasions , in 2003/4 and 2005-6 , under the so-called " project squirrel . "
not informed many bahn employees feel disillusioned with the company .
this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that klaus-dieter hommel , gdba trade union " i don ´ t feel happy about working here , " says one .
" of course , the top managers knew what was going on .
it 's totally unacceptable .
" they were stupid and clumsy . "
the unravelling of deutsche bahn 's activities has turned into the biggest scandal in the company 's history and the atmosphere within the company is said to be " highly tense " .
the spying scandal is threatening to topple the truculent chief executive , hartmut mehdorn .
employee representatives are furious , insisting they were not informed of the surveillance operation .
" i 'm shocked and disgusted at the company culture here , " says klaus-dieter hommel , from the gdba trade union , shaking his head .
" did they think that this kind of surveillance was normal ?
they totally ignored workers ' rights and their privacy .
" this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that . "
raises questions under increasing pressure from the unions , mr mehdorn finally sent a letter to deutsche bahn employees apologising for giving investigators access to personal data .
it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible transport minister wolfgang tiefensee but his belated apology was quickly dismissed by parliamentarians .
horst friedrich , the transport spokesman for the liberal fdp party , has condemned the bahn 's handling of the affair as " salami tactics " insisting " the government must clear up this issue " .
even transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says he is not satisfied with deutsche bahn 's report .
" it raises more questions than it answers , " he says , looking ashen-faced and stunned after emerging from a parliamentary transport commission meeting .
" it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible . "
deutsche bahn 's senior managers insist they were not informed about what was going on .
but the unions remain sceptical and there are now growing calls for mr mehdorn to step down , though chancellor angela merkel is standing by him .
legal or illegal ?
berlin 's data protection commissioner and prosecutors are currently conducting an investigation into the affair over any breaches of data protection .
the railway operator insists it has not broken the law although there 's talk of a legal " grey area " , some lawyers are convinced that deutsche bahn 's actions were illegal .
" this does not correspond with german law , " says monika birnbaum , an employment lawyer at the firm , schwarz kelwing wicke westpfahl .
" screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies is in accordance with german data protection law only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree with this beforehand .
" as far as we know , these criteria were not fulfilled , so the screening was contrary to labour law and data protection law . "
but the railway operator insists the practices were legal , although there is a caveat .
" according to what we know , the screening was legal , " a spokesman for deutsche bahn says .
" the screening was carried out to fight corruption .
" however , the question does arise as to whether german data protection law was properly recognised especially because no information was forwarded to the supervisory board and to employee representatives . "
mr mehdorn has been invited by mps to give evidence at the german parliament 's transport commission on 4 march .
he should expect a hostile reception .

inside an even harsher storm is brewing .
deutsche bahn is in deep trouble .
not only has the state-owned operator had to postpone a recent planned part-privatisation because of the financial crisis .
now it is also accused of spying on its own staff .
" i am so angry , i still ca n't believe that they were spying on their workers for so many years , " says one employee , who does not want to be identified , as he nervously looks around at the crowd outside the underground station at potsdamer platz .
although people 's faces were concealed by large woollen hats and scarves , it seemed as if he was scared that someone would recognise him .
" come around the corner , i can talk better there , " he says in a flustered voice as he rests his shoulder against a wall .
" i have worked at this company for the past 30 years , and i 've never experienced anything like this before .
they spied on workers and their relatives , and the managers thought they could get away with it .
" it 's outrageous .
this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , they just wanted to keep an eye on all the workers here . "
secret agents the scandal just will not go away .
the german people have been shocked by deutsche bahn 's behaviour german members of parliament from across the political spectrum are baying for blood and newspaper commentators are having a field day .
" the bahn has lost track of reality , " ran one headline .
the affair has all the ingredients of a james bond film .
it involves covert surveillance operations that were given exotic code names such as " babylon " , " traviata " or " prometheus " as well as a private detective agency .
deutsche bahn has admitted that it conducted a surveillance operation on its staff on five separate occasions , dating back to 1998 .
the official aim of the vetting scheme was to root out corruption .
investigators and a berlin detective agency were hired to carry out the job .
extensive surveillance in a country with a history of state surveillance , such as under the nazis and communist east germany , it is hardly surprising that germans were shocked by the latest revelations .
they were stupid and clumsy deutsche bahn employee deutsche bahn has submitted a 37-page report to the german government and parliament .
in the report , the bahn admits that three major screenings took place in 1998 , 2002/3 and 2005/6 .
the names , addresses , telephone numbers and bank details of staff were compared with those of suppliers to detect possible illicit transactions .
under the codename " project babylon " , some 173,000 employees of deutsche bahn were vetted from 2002/3 and their personal details were compared with 80,000 suppliers .
on top of this , deutsche bahn has now acknowledged that it screened its managers and their relatives on two other occasions , in 2003/4 and 2005-6 , under the so-called " project squirrel . "
not informed many bahn employees feel disillusioned with the company .
this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that klaus-dieter hommel , gdba trade union " i don ´ t feel happy about working here , " says one .
" of course , the top managers knew what was going on .
it 's totally unacceptable .
" they were stupid and clumsy . "
the unravelling of deutsche bahn 's activities has turned into the biggest scandal in the company 's history and the atmosphere within the company is said to be " highly tense " .
the spying scandal is threatening to topple the truculent chief executive , hartmut mehdorn .
employee representatives are furious , insisting they were not informed of the surveillance operation .
" i 'm shocked and disgusted at the company culture here , " says klaus-dieter hommel , from the gdba trade union , shaking his head .
" did they think that this kind of surveillance was normal ?
they totally ignored workers ' rights and their privacy .
" this had nothing to do with fighting corruption , you do n't have to monitor staff to do that . "
raises questions under increasing pressure from the unions , mr mehdorn finally sent a letter to deutsche bahn employees apologising for giving investigators access to personal data .
it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible transport minister wolfgang tiefensee but his belated apology was quickly dismissed by parliamentarians .
horst friedrich , the transport spokesman for the liberal fdp party , has condemned the bahn 's handling of the affair as " salami tactics " insisting " the government must clear up this issue " .
even transport minister wolfgang tiefensee says he is not satisfied with deutsche bahn 's report .
" it raises more questions than it answers , " he says , looking ashen-faced and stunned after emerging from a parliamentary transport commission meeting .
" it 's still not clear who exactly was responsible . "
deutsche bahn 's senior managers insist they were not informed about what was going on .
but the unions remain sceptical and there are now growing calls for mr mehdorn to step down , though chancellor angela merkel is standing by him .
legal or illegal ?
berlin 's data protection commissioner and prosecutors are currently conducting an investigation into the affair over any breaches of data protection .
the railway operator insists it has not broken the law although there 's talk of a legal " grey area " , some lawyers are convinced that deutsche bahn 's actions were illegal .
" this does not correspond with german law , " says monika birnbaum , an employment lawyer at the firm , schwarz kelwing wicke westpfahl .
" screening the private data of employees and comparing this with the data of supplier companies is in accordance with german data protection law only if the employees themselves and the workers ' council agree with this beforehand .
" as far as we know , these criteria were not fulfilled , so the screening was contrary to labour law and data protection law . "
but the railway operator insists the practices were legal , although there is a caveat .
" according to what we know , the screening was legal , " a spokesman for deutsche bahn says .
" the screening was carried out to fight corruption .
" however , the question does arise as to whether german data protection law was properly recognised especially because no information was forwarded to the supervisory board and to employee representatives . "
mr mehdorn has been invited by mps to give evidence at the german parliament 's transport commission on 4 march .
he should expect a hostile reception .

since 2000 , the colorado river - which provides water for seven us states in the region - has carried less water than at any time in recorded history .
see the water cycle and while the drought is worsening , the demand for water in this booming part of the country is increasing .
the states dependent on the colorado river for their water are seeking solutions to their water shortage , with some suggesting that importing water from far-flung states - or even towing icebergs down from the arctic - could solve the problems .
water trends how availability , use and needs are changing across the world in graphics meanwhile , the us states and canadian provinces of the water-rich great lakes basin have drawn up an agreement to restrict the export of water from their region .
experts say this pattern - of water shortages in dry regions , and protective agreements in wet areas - is likely to repeat itself elsewhere as the world demand for water begins to exceed supply .
transporting water the seven us states served by the colorado river commissioned a study in 2006 to look into ways to augment their existing supply of water .
" the water levels that we considered normal flow just are n't going to exist anymore , " said pat mulroy , chief executive of the southern nevada water authority .
the states asked consultants to consider the feasibility of 12 potential options , ranging from the large-scale re-use of household wastewater , to the importation of fresh water from further afield .
importing water is not a new idea .
for years , engineers and politicians have been coming up with proposals to transport water from water-rich northern california or alaska down to the desert south-west .
in the early 1970s , the us bureau of reclamation began looking into the idea of building an underwater aqueduct to carry water from northern california to the south of the state .
the feasibility studies were never completed , but in the 1990s , alaska governor walter hickel resurrected the idea of an ocean pipeline , this time to transport water from alaska to the south-west us .
the great lakes are in trouble maude barlow council of the canadians again , however , the plans were discarded .
the consultants acting for the seven colorado river states also looked into the pipeline option , and concluded that such a project could potentially bring large quantities of water to the region .
the plan would pose serious technical difficulties , cost billions of dollars , and could threaten alaska 's fish population .
they also looked in to the possibility of shipping water down from the north-west , either in refitted oil tankers or specially-designed nylon bags that could be towed by tugboats .
towing icebergs several companies have been formed in recent years promising to make water transportation a reality , according to the consultants ' report .
future water stress interactive map : water stress in a changing world one such firm - transglobal trade - has signed long-term agreements with native american groups in alaska for bulk water rights , although it has yet to begin shipping it .
and global h20 resources , a canadian firm , has been granted rights to 4.8bn gallons of glacier water every year for 30 years by the alaskan city of sitka .
for years , engineers have dreamed of tapping into the freshwater resources of the arctic , by towing icebergs from northern waters down to california .
but such proposals have always foundered because of the impracticability of insulating the ice to prevent melting in transit .
although the colorado river states did consider some of these ambitious water importation schemes , their engineers concluded that projects closer to home - like water conservation , and desalination of ocean water - were more practical and realistic options .
" i would describe some of the -lsb- water importation -rsb- options as ' brainstorming ' , " said southern nevada water authority spokesman scott huntley .
" but that does n't mean that one day water importation from further afield could n't become a reality . "
" the colorado river system will ultimately have to be augmented from somewhere , " added pat mulroy .
" but it 's more feasible to divert floodwaters from the mid-west than to get water from canada , " she added .
' awash in water ' during last year 's presidential election campaign , one candidate for the democratic party nomination - new mexico governor bill richardson - called for a national water policy , noting that great lakes states like wisconsin were " awash in water " .
chicago diverts 2bn gallons of water daily from the great lakes no official suggestions have been made for large-scale transfers of water from the great lakes basin to the parched south-west .
but that has not prevented the us states and two canadian provinces that surround the lakes to draw up an agreement restricting the export of water from the region .
the agreement - known as the great lakes-st lawrence river basin water resources compact - bans any new diversion of water from the great lakes basin , though " limited exceptions could be allowed in communities near the basin when rigorous standards are met " .
legally unstoppable it is these " limited exceptions " that worry the council of canadians , which campaigns for sustainable water usage in canada , and whose chairperson maude barlow advises the un general assembly 's president on water issues .
the council warns that by granting special rights to communities and counties straddling the great lakes , the compact will allow " vast amounts of water -lsb- to -rsb- be transferred outside the great lakes basin , which will have adverse effects on its ecological integrity and lead to further depletion of water in the basin " .
" the great lakes are in trouble , " ms barlow said .
" people say there 's plenty of water here - but that 's what they said about the aral sea in russia . "
chicago already diverts 2bn gallons -lrb- 7.5bn litres -rrb- of water every day from the great lakes basin , and the compact does little to prevent the city taking even more water .
bottled water companies are also exempt from the agreement , which the council says could lead to the unacceptable exploitation of great lakes .
" once bottled water corporations are granted this right it will be difficult to regulate taking water out of the great lakes in containers because the practice would be protected in international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " it warns .
the council fears that if water is designated as a commodity under nafta , a precedent would be set , and large-scale export of canadian water to the us would become legally unstoppable .
" i doubt that the south-western us states will be looking to the great lakes for their water - but they may well look to parts of northern canada , " said ms barlow .
new administration prices and policies must be set in ways that give everyone a clear incentive to use water efficiently and avoid waste barack obama us president barack obama has emphasised the need to conserve water and notably did not include any big water projects in the stimulus package .
this suggests that the incoming administration will not look kindly on any grand schemes to bring water to the parched south-west .
pat mulroy agrees with this analysis .
" there has to be a mosaic of solutions - but conservation and re-use should be at the forefront of any strategy " , she told me .
the lesson may well be that to keep the water flowing in the desert , it makes little sense to tow icebergs down from the arctic , or to divert water from the great lakes .
but water there is should be conserved , re-used and treasured as the precious natural resource that it is .

water trends how availability , use and needs are changing across the world in graphics meanwhile , the us states and canadian provinces of the water-rich great lakes basin have drawn up an agreement to restrict the export of water from their region .
experts say this pattern - of water shortages in dry regions , and protective agreements in wet areas - is likely to repeat itself elsewhere as the world demand for water begins to exceed supply .
transporting water the seven us states served by the colorado river commissioned a study in 2006 to look into ways to augment their existing supply of water .
" the water levels that we considered normal flow just are n't going to exist anymore , " said pat mulroy , chief executive of the southern nevada water authority .
the states asked consultants to consider the feasibility of 12 potential options , ranging from the large-scale re-use of household wastewater , to the importation of fresh water from further afield .
importing water is not a new idea .
for years , engineers and politicians have been coming up with proposals to transport water from water-rich northern california or alaska down to the desert south-west .
in the early 1970s , the us bureau of reclamation began looking into the idea of building an underwater aqueduct to carry water from northern california to the south of the state .
the feasibility studies were never completed , but in the 1990s , alaska governor walter hickel resurrected the idea of an ocean pipeline , this time to transport water from alaska to the south-west us .
the great lakes are in trouble maude barlow council of the canadians again , however , the plans were discarded .
the consultants acting for the seven colorado river states also looked into the pipeline option , and concluded that such a project could potentially bring large quantities of water to the region .
the plan would pose serious technical difficulties , cost billions of dollars , and could threaten alaska 's fish population .
they also looked in to the possibility of shipping water down from the north-west , either in refitted oil tankers or specially-designed nylon bags that could be towed by tugboats .
towing icebergs several companies have been formed in recent years promising to make water transportation a reality , according to the consultants ' report .
future water stress interactive map : water stress in a changing world one such firm - transglobal trade - has signed long-term agreements with native american groups in alaska for bulk water rights , although it has yet to begin shipping it .
and global h20 resources , a canadian firm , has been granted rights to 4.8bn gallons of glacier water every year for 30 years by the alaskan city of sitka .
for years , engineers have dreamed of tapping into the freshwater resources of the arctic , by towing icebergs from northern waters down to california .
but such proposals have always foundered because of the impracticability of insulating the ice to prevent melting in transit .
although the colorado river states did consider some of these ambitious water importation schemes , their engineers concluded that projects closer to home - like water conservation , and desalination of ocean water - were more practical and realistic options .
" i would describe some of the -lsb- water importation -rsb- options as ' brainstorming ' , " said southern nevada water authority spokesman scott huntley .
" but that does n't mean that one day water importation from further afield could n't become a reality . "
" the colorado river system will ultimately have to be augmented from somewhere , " added pat mulroy .
" but it 's more feasible to divert floodwaters from the mid-west than to get water from canada , " she added .
' awash in water ' during last year 's presidential election campaign , one candidate for the democratic party nomination - new mexico governor bill richardson - called for a national water policy , noting that great lakes states like wisconsin were " awash in water " .
chicago diverts 2bn gallons of water daily from the great lakes no official suggestions have been made for large-scale transfers of water from the great lakes basin to the parched south-west .
but that has not prevented the us states and two canadian provinces that surround the lakes to draw up an agreement restricting the export of water from the region .
the agreement - known as the great lakes-st lawrence river basin water resources compact - bans any new diversion of water from the great lakes basin , though " limited exceptions could be allowed in communities near the basin when rigorous standards are met " .
legally unstoppable it is these " limited exceptions " that worry the council of canadians , which campaigns for sustainable water usage in canada , and whose chairperson maude barlow advises the un general assembly 's president on water issues .
the council warns that by granting special rights to communities and counties straddling the great lakes , the compact will allow " vast amounts of water -lsb- to -rsb- be transferred outside the great lakes basin , which will have adverse effects on its ecological integrity and lead to further depletion of water in the basin " .
" the great lakes are in trouble , " ms barlow said .
" people say there 's plenty of water here - but that 's what they said about the aral sea in russia . "
chicago already diverts 2bn gallons -lrb- 7.5bn litres -rrb- of water every day from the great lakes basin , and the compact does little to prevent the city taking even more water .
bottled water companies are also exempt from the agreement , which the council says could lead to the unacceptable exploitation of great lakes .
" once bottled water corporations are granted this right it will be difficult to regulate taking water out of the great lakes in containers because the practice would be protected in international trade agreements such as the north american free trade agreement -lrb- nafta -rrb- , " it warns .
the council fears that if water is designated as a commodity under nafta , a precedent would be set , and large-scale export of canadian water to the us would become legally unstoppable .
" i doubt that the south-western us states will be looking to the great lakes for their water - but they may well look to parts of northern canada , " said ms barlow .
new administration prices and policies must be set in ways that give everyone a clear incentive to use water efficiently and avoid waste barack obama us president barack obama has emphasised the need to conserve water and notably did not include any big water projects in the stimulus package .
this suggests that the incoming administration will not look kindly on any grand schemes to bring water to the parched south-west .
pat mulroy agrees with this analysis .
" there has to be a mosaic of solutions - but conservation and re-use should be at the forefront of any strategy " , she told me .
the lesson may well be that to keep the water flowing in the desert , it makes little sense to tow icebergs down from the arctic , or to divert water from the great lakes .
but water there is should be conserved , re-used and treasured as the precious natural resource that it is .

geert wilders arrived at heathrow but only got as far as immigration the government has come under fire after banning a dutch mp from entering the uk over anti-islamic remarks .
former conservative cabinet minister michael portillo said by turning away geert wilders , ministers had made a " populist twit and bigot " world famous .
the freedom party mp had been invited to a house of lords screening of his film , linking the koran to terrorism .
muslim groups backed the government 's decision and labelled mr wilder " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
' free speech ' mr wilders , who faces trial in his own country for inciting hatred , caused outrage across the muslim world last year when he posted his film , fitna , on the internet .
now he is at the centre of further controversy following an invitation from the uk independence party 's lord pearson to show his film in the house of lords .
lord pearson told the bbc it was a " matter of free speech " and the film would only be offensive to violent islamists .
i do n't agree with everything that geert wilders has to say , but i believe he has the right to say it in a democracy crossbench peer baroness cox fitna 's opening scenes show a copy of the koran followed by footage of the 9/11 attacks in the us and the bombings in madrid in 2004 and london in 2005 .
the lords screening went ahead as planned , despite mr wilders ' absence , although only five peer and no mps were present .
but mr portillo expressed concerns those who did attend would not be the only people to view it .
speaking on bbc1 's this week , he said the mp held " unattractive " opinions but had he been allowed in he would have arrived " unnoticed to show his film to 30 fairly eccentric peers " .
instead , he said , he has become a " globally famous figure " with thousands of people going on the internet to watch the film .
differences and debate crossbench peer baroness cox , who hosted a later screening for the media , accused the british government of " succumbing to threats of intimidation " .
she said it was " a very sad and a very disturbing day for british democracy when a european parliamentarian has not been allowed into this country " .

michael portillo on geert wilders ' exclusion from the uk mr wilders defended his visit to the uk , saying he had visited two weeks ago and planned to return in the future .
he said : " i 'm not doing anything wrong .
i 'm not protesting or running through the streets of london .
" democracy means differences and debate .
it 's a very sad day when the uk bans an elected parliamentarian . "
he went on to accuse gordon brown of being the " biggest coward in europe " .

" this is not about freedom of speech but about stopping the incitement to religious hatred this man promotes . "
earlier , the muslim council of britain said mr wilders was " an open and relentless preacher of hate " .
the home secretary has the power to stop people entering the uk if she believes there is a threat to national security , public order or the safety of uk citizens , but she can not exclude people simply because of their views .
foreign secretary david miliband said the home secretary made a decision on an individual case .
" we have profound commitment to freedom of speech but there is no freedom to cry ' fire ' in a crowded theatre and there is no freedom to stir up hate , religious and racial hatred , according to the laws of the land , " he added .
lib dem home affairs spokesman chris huhne said even with freedom of speech , there was a line to be drawn .
the dutch government said it " regretted " the decision to bar mr wilders from the uk , saying it believed all its mps " should be able to travel freely in the european union " .
