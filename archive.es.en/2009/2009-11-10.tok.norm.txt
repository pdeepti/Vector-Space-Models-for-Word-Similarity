economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 10.11.2009 european musicians usher in change in 1989 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : by november 9 , 1989 , berliners were singing and dancing atop the berlin wall pop and rock songs form a soundtrack to the story that leads from the cold war to peaceful revolution in eastern europe .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , celebrity musicians recall “ their ” november 9 , 1989 twenty years ago , the eyes of the world turned to berlin to witness the images that have since become iconic symbols of peaceful revolution .
pop music also played a role in that momentous and moving story , reflecting the mood of events from the cold war to the collapse of communism and german reunification .
back in 1983 and 1984 , in an era of rising cold war tensions , the song " 99 luftballons , " known in the english speaking world as " 99 red balloons , " was a global hit for west german pop star nena .
the lyrics were inspired by the image of balloons floating over the berlin wall , which triggered 99 years of war and left the planet in ruins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like english hard rockers " saxon , " some of the key musicians were n't german in 1988 , shortly before a revolutionary wave welled up in poland and washed through hungary , east germany , czechoslovakia and virtually all the soviet satellite states , english heavy metal outfit saxon released a song called " for whom the bell tolls . "
saxon ’ s song eerily predicts events in berlin in 1989 : " a city divided , the west and the east .
tear down the walls , and give them release .
people are marching , they 're out in the streets , shouting for freedom , shouting for peace . "
march and shout is precisely what hundreds of thousands of east germans did at demonstrations demanding change and civil liberties in the autumn of 1989 .
they were also listening to restive rock music .
the sounds of freedom puhdys were one of the best-loved bands in east germany , but like all artists in the country , they had to bow to the censors .
their 1989 album contains songs with titles that translate to " free like the wind " and " new heroes , " songs with carefully formulated lines anticipating the change to come .
well before that , however , their 1984 release " ich will nicht vergessen " -lrb- i don ’ t want to forget -rrb- addresses what it means to be german and the division between those " here " and " there . "
despite puhdys ’ good standing with the regime , the song was banned from tv and radio but became a kind of secret anthem for many in the east .
in the summers of 1987 and 1988 , music had helped to stir unrest in the east .
major concerts by pink floyd , david bowie and michael jackson were held close to the western side of the wall .
east berliners wanted to get up close to listen .
none of this went down well with authorities , and it caused political fallout and even violent skirmishes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in the usa but big in berlin : bruce springsteen in july 1988 , us singer / songwriter bruce springsteen received permission to perform in east berlin .
the communists considered him a working class hero and at the time also wanted to polish up the state ’ s appeal to its citizens .
performing for 160,000 east germans , springsteen called out to the crowd : " i want to tell you i 'm not here for or against any government , i came to play rock ' n ' roll for you east berliners in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down . "
he spoke in german and the crowd went wild before springsteen launched into a cover of bob dylan ’ s " chimes of freedom . "
the following year , east germans drained the state of its life blood , fleeing via neighboring hungary and czechoslovakia .
the world tensely looked on , wondering if it all might end in a violent crackdown reminiscent of tiananmen square in china earlier in 1989 .
east german rock stars released and often recited daring criticism of the government in a paper known as the " rock resolution , " risking their careers and homes by speaking out but encouraging change nonetheless .
anthem of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die aerzte call themselves " the world 's best band " bela b. of west german punk rock band die aerzte vividly remembers the night of november 9 , 1989 .
" i was sitting in my favorite pub , which was unusually empty , which made me wonder .
i looked out the window and suddenly saw east german soldiers walk past .
i told the bartender , but he just said , ‘ that ’ s it , you ’ ve had enough to drink ! ’ "
half an hour later , when an unfamiliar group of punk rockers walked into the bar , bela b. knew something was up .
" they told us that they ’ d just crossed the wall from east germany and wanted to check out the famous hot spots , " recalled bela b. his own fame was also legendary in the east .
" they recognized me immediately and couldn ’ t believe their eyes , saying ‘ incredible !
we come to this place and the guy from die aerzte is sitting right there ! ’
i spent the rest of the night with them and listened to all their stories .
it was a very cool experience . "
while many east germans relished their new-found freedoms , some westerners were just as excited about being able to travel at will to the east .
when the news sank in , west german artist marius mueller-westernhagen started forging plans to perform there .
" before that i had always refused because they censored lyrics , " he said .
westernhagen ’ s song " freiheit , " which means " freedom , " became an anthem of the era of change in germany .
the next generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger waters of pink floyd fame kept his promise later , in the years following the fall of the iron curtain , issues of identity , solidarity and nostalgia plagued the new germany .
die aerzte 's 1995 release " hurra " is an example of a critical commentary on german reunification .
but in those initial moments of a divided nation closing the gap , most were optimistic about the future .
ringing in the new year and a new decade , berlin was the place to party .
for the first time in nearly 30 years , east and west germans could celebrate together .
in his hard-to-miss jacket studded with blinking lights , us celebrity david hasselhoff performed at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
his song " looking for freedom " was one of the highest ranking hits of 1989 in germany .
today , it 's more difficult for the younger generation to relate to the significance of the events of that year .
bill kaulitz is the lead singer in the popular boy group tokio hotel , a band from magdeburg in former east germany .
" it was never a huge topic for us , " he said .
" we get asked about it a lot , especially when we travel abroad .
sometimes people have really wild notions about it , asking us if there are bananas where we come from .
for us there ’ s only one germany , we never knew it any other way . "
bill was just a baby when the berlin wall fell and he speaks for many of his twenty-something peers .
back in 1979 , a decade before long lines of east german trabant cars crossed through the border and strangers tearfully embraced at brandenburg gate , english rock group pink floyd released their famous rock opera , " the wall . "
singer roger waters adapted it into a film a few years later .
in a radio interview in july 1989 , waters said he ’ d only perform it again live if the berlin wall came down - which it did , just months later .
true to his word , waters staged a massive spectacle in july 1990 where the wall once stood .
an estimated 350,000 people attended and the event was broadcast in 52 countries and later released as a live cd , video and dvd .

economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .

twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , celebrity musicians recall “ their ” november 9 , 1989 twenty years ago , the eyes of the world turned to berlin to witness the images that have since become iconic symbols of peaceful revolution .
pop music also played a role in that momentous and moving story , reflecting the mood of events from the cold war to the collapse of communism and german reunification .
back in 1983 and 1984 , in an era of rising cold war tensions , the song " 99 luftballons , " known in the english speaking world as " 99 red balloons , " was a global hit for west german pop star nena .
the lyrics were inspired by the image of balloons floating over the berlin wall , which triggered 99 years of war and left the planet in ruins .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : like english hard rockers " saxon , " some of the key musicians were n't german in 1988 , shortly before a revolutionary wave welled up in poland and washed through hungary , east germany , czechoslovakia and virtually all the soviet satellite states , english heavy metal outfit saxon released a song called " for whom the bell tolls . "
saxon ’ s song eerily predicts events in berlin in 1989 : " a city divided , the west and the east .
tear down the walls , and give them release .
people are marching , they 're out in the streets , shouting for freedom , shouting for peace . "
march and shout is precisely what hundreds of thousands of east germans did at demonstrations demanding change and civil liberties in the autumn of 1989 .
they were also listening to restive rock music .
the sounds of freedom puhdys were one of the best-loved bands in east germany , but like all artists in the country , they had to bow to the censors .
their 1989 album contains songs with titles that translate to " free like the wind " and " new heroes , " songs with carefully formulated lines anticipating the change to come .
well before that , however , their 1984 release " ich will nicht vergessen " -lrb- i don ’ t want to forget -rrb- addresses what it means to be german and the division between those " here " and " there . "
despite puhdys ’ good standing with the regime , the song was banned from tv and radio but became a kind of secret anthem for many in the east .
in the summers of 1987 and 1988 , music had helped to stir unrest in the east .
major concerts by pink floyd , david bowie and michael jackson were held close to the western side of the wall .
east berliners wanted to get up close to listen .
none of this went down well with authorities , and it caused political fallout and even violent skirmishes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : born in the usa but big in berlin : bruce springsteen in july 1988 , us singer / songwriter bruce springsteen received permission to perform in east berlin .
the communists considered him a working class hero and at the time also wanted to polish up the state ’ s appeal to its citizens .
performing for 160,000 east germans , springsteen called out to the crowd : " i want to tell you i 'm not here for or against any government , i came to play rock ' n ' roll for you east berliners in the hope that one day all the barriers will be torn down . "
he spoke in german and the crowd went wild before springsteen launched into a cover of bob dylan ’ s " chimes of freedom . "
the following year , east germans drained the state of its life blood , fleeing via neighboring hungary and czechoslovakia .
the world tensely looked on , wondering if it all might end in a violent crackdown reminiscent of tiananmen square in china earlier in 1989 .
east german rock stars released and often recited daring criticism of the government in a paper known as the " rock resolution , " risking their careers and homes by speaking out but encouraging change nonetheless .
anthem of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : die aerzte call themselves " the world 's best band " bela b. of west german punk rock band die aerzte vividly remembers the night of november 9 , 1989 .
" i was sitting in my favorite pub , which was unusually empty , which made me wonder .
i looked out the window and suddenly saw east german soldiers walk past .
i told the bartender , but he just said , ‘ that ’ s it , you ’ ve had enough to drink ! ’ "
half an hour later , when an unfamiliar group of punk rockers walked into the bar , bela b. knew something was up .
" they told us that they ’ d just crossed the wall from east germany and wanted to check out the famous hot spots , " recalled bela b. his own fame was also legendary in the east .
" they recognized me immediately and couldn ’ t believe their eyes , saying ‘ incredible !
we come to this place and the guy from die aerzte is sitting right there ! ’
i spent the rest of the night with them and listened to all their stories .
it was a very cool experience . "
while many east germans relished their new-found freedoms , some westerners were just as excited about being able to travel at will to the east .
when the news sank in , west german artist marius mueller-westernhagen started forging plans to perform there .
" before that i had always refused because they censored lyrics , " he said .
westernhagen ’ s song " freiheit , " which means " freedom , " became an anthem of the era of change in germany .
the next generation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roger waters of pink floyd fame kept his promise later , in the years following the fall of the iron curtain , issues of identity , solidarity and nostalgia plagued the new germany .
die aerzte 's 1995 release " hurra " is an example of a critical commentary on german reunification .
but in those initial moments of a divided nation closing the gap , most were optimistic about the future .
ringing in the new year and a new decade , berlin was the place to party .
for the first time in nearly 30 years , east and west germans could celebrate together .
in his hard-to-miss jacket studded with blinking lights , us celebrity david hasselhoff performed at berlin 's brandenburg gate .
his song " looking for freedom " was one of the highest ranking hits of 1989 in germany .
today , it 's more difficult for the younger generation to relate to the significance of the events of that year .
bill kaulitz is the lead singer in the popular boy group tokio hotel , a band from magdeburg in former east germany .
" it was never a huge topic for us , " he said .
" we get asked about it a lot , especially when we travel abroad .
sometimes people have really wild notions about it , asking us if there are bananas where we come from .
for us there ’ s only one germany , we never knew it any other way . "
bill was just a baby when the berlin wall fell and he speaks for many of his twenty-something peers .
back in 1979 , a decade before long lines of east german trabant cars crossed through the border and strangers tearfully embraced at brandenburg gate , english rock group pink floyd released their famous rock opera , " the wall . "
singer roger waters adapted it into a film a few years later .
in a radio interview in july 1989 , waters said he ’ d only perform it again live if the berlin wall came down - which it did , just months later .
true to his word , waters staged a massive spectacle in july 1990 where the wall once stood .
an estimated 350,000 people attended and the event was broadcast in 52 countries and later released as a live cd , video and dvd .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners arrive at auschwitz that was the night , 71 years ago , when jewish citizens and their property became the targets of mass-scale coordinated attacks across germany and austria .
knobloch said that although it was natural and quite right for germany to be focusing so sharply on the events of two decades ago , it was also important to mark both occasions appropriately in the future .
speaking in munich on monday , she said the desecration of a synagoge in the city of dresden , which was sprayed with swastikas a day before the reunification celebrations , clearly demonstrated that antisemitism and public incitement were " a serious problem . "
nazi thinking , she added , " has seeped into all areas of society . "
she said 550 antisemitic crimes had been committed across germany in the first half of this year , and stressed the importance of making sure young people are aware of history .
paving the road to auschwitz while the night of november 9 , 1989 , signalled the opening of the gates to freedom for east germans , knobloch said , the same night 51 years earlier had paved the way to auschwitz .
germany has to show that it " is committed to the basic democratic values - with an awareness of the darkest chapter in its history . "
kristallnacht commemoration ceremonies were held across germany and president horst koehler , who was attending a 20-year anniversary service in berlin , urged the congregation not to forget 1938 .
he said the two historic dates were connected , and that germany had survived the division " because we have learned the necessary lessons from our history between 1933 and 1945 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burned out ruins of a berlin synagogue after kristallnacht , 1938 koehler added that germany would forever remember the link between the two dates .
systematic destruction and brutality during kristallnacht , german forces and the hitler youth took sledgehammers to jewish homes and business and destroyed at least 200 synagogues .
they murdered some ninety jews and arrested as many as 30,000 , who were then transported to concentration camps .
those imprisoned were largely healthy young men , and they were subjected to systematic and often fatal brutality .
most were released within three months of their arrest on condition that they leave germany , but by that time more than 2,000 had already died .
november 9 , 1938 has always been seen as a major turning point in the treatment of jews in nazi germany , and has often been referred to as the start of the holocaust. tkw / reuters / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said the two historic dates were connected , and that germany had survived the division " because we have learned the necessary lessons from our history between 1933 and 1945 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burned out ruins of a berlin synagogue after kristallnacht , 1938 koehler added that germany would forever remember the link between the two dates .
systematic destruction and brutality during kristallnacht , german forces and the hitler youth took sledgehammers to jewish homes and business and destroyed at least 200 synagogues .
they murdered some ninety jews and arrested as many as 30,000 , who were then transported to concentration camps .
those imprisoned were largely healthy young men , and they were subjected to systematic and often fatal brutality .
most were released within three months of their arrest on condition that they leave germany , but by that time more than 2,000 had already died .
november 9 , 1938 has always been seen as a major turning point in the treatment of jews in nazi germany , and has often been referred to as the start of the holocaust. tkw / reuters / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

" this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

general motors announced last week that opel would have to shed roughly 10,000 jobs to remain profitable , and now ceo henderson has to try to sell this plan to the staff council at opel 's german base of ruesselsheim .
" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .

however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .

" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .
henderson 's meeting with staff council head klaus franz may not be amicable .
in his previous role as opel ceo , henderson became renowned among workers for his tough job-cutting measures .
now , history is poised to repeat itself .
this is the second and final day of henderson 's trip to ruesselsheim .
on monday he met with opel leaders to discuss the company 's future .
an opel spokesman said the ceo is holding internal talks at the opel headquarters , in a bid to gain some insight into the current situation there .
out with the new due to the improving economic climate , general motors recently decided to cancel the proposed sale of opel to canadian car-parts maker magna .
this has angered the german government and local opel unions , because magna had promised to protect all five opel factories based in germany .
other opel employees throughout europe , however , have welcomed general motors ' decision .
bildunterschrift : gm 's decision to keep opel sparked protests according to the german business daily handelsblatt , the opel works council has written to the european union competition commissioner , neelie kroes , asking her to stop any job-cutting measures that are too hard on germany .
however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .
opel factories in antwerp , belgium , and bochum and eisenach , in germany , are considered the most at risk of closure during the restructuring of opel .

gm europe boss carl-peter forster , a keen backer of the magna takeover bid , stepped down after gm 's decision to keep the company .
he is now being linked with the budget indian carmaker tata .
meanwhile , henderson was to give a press conference later tuesday , elaborating on gm 's future plans for its european subsidiary .
this could be a critical moment for gm , which still hopes for state support to help fund the opel restructuring .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2009 eu finance ministers grapple with budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national budget deficits must not exceed three percent european finance ministers gathered in belgium on tuesday in a bid to tackle excessive debts accumulated in the wake of the financial crisis .
failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .

the transaction is still subject to approval by anti-trust authorities .
" the german regional distribution grids , which form by far the largest part of e.on 's network business , are not affected by this sale and will remain an essential part of the infrastructure business managed by e.on energie in munich , " e.on said in a statement .
e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat said the deal was an important step towards the integration of europe 's electricity market .
the deal will also help the company resolve a european union investigation into whether e.on had thwarted competition .
the eu has been putting pressure on energy companies to separate production from generation in a bid to increase competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulf bernotat bernotat said that e.on has " almost completely fulfilled " its commitment to the european commission after selling its transmission network as well as 4,800 megawatts of power generation capacity .
dutch minister : " assuring security of supply " “ this takeover will help to create a north-west european electricity market in which the netherlands plays a leading role , ” maria van der hoeven , the dutch minister of economic affairs , said in a statement .
“ the integration is essential to assuring the security of supply . ”
tennet has spent a total of 776 million euros this year on buying the power networks of three dutch utilities .
the sale could complicate plans by the german government for the eventual creation of national network company , netz ag , which would bring all four of germany 's high-voltage grids together under one roof .
last week , the german subsidiary of swedish power group vattenfall , vattenfall europe , said it would also sell its electric network , but did n't provide details .
according to press reports , vattenfall is planning to sell its grid to a consortium that includes goldman sachs , deutsche bank and insurance group allianz for around 500 million euros . dc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de history of vattenfall nuclear power errors stretches back two years the kruemmel nuclear power plant in northern germany had only been back online for two weeks before a malfunction saw it taken back off the power grid .
dw looks back at a series of events surrounding the facility .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 10.11.2009 berlusconi wins backing for justice reform großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a top court overturned an immunity law shielding berlusconi from a corruption trial last month silvio berlusconi , who is set to go on trial soon , appears to have won backing for a radical justice reform linked to the length of trials in courts .
but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .
ultimatum to allies berlusconi has been in combative mode since italy 's top court last month ruled that his immunity from prosecution while in office was unconstitutional .
it overturned a law passed by his government which critics said was tailor-made to protect him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who accused berlusconi of trying to silence critical voices , held a rally in rome last month the law grants immunity from prosecution to the country 's four top office holders while in office , including the premier , the president of the republic and the two parliamentary speakers berlusconi has since demanded that his allies commit themselves to protecting him from what he calls an onslaught by " communist " magistrates and judges . on sunday , il giornale , the newspaper owned by the berlusconi family , issued an ultimatum to his allies , saying they must back laws shielding the prime minister from court trials or risk a government collapse . the front-page headline of the newspaper read : " berlusconi ultimatum : those who do n't agree are out of the pdl , " referring to his people of freedom coalition .
the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .
arrest warrant for berlusconi aide news that there was support for the new law came a day after the center-right government had another brush with the courts .
magistrates in naples issued an arrest warrant late on monday for nicola cosentino , parliamentarian and undersecretary to economy minister giulio tremonti .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a berlusconi aide is accused of mafia collusion relating to illegal garbage disposal in naples cosentino is reportedly accused of links with the infamous casalese clan of the camorra , the neapolitan version of the sicilian mafia .
some media reports said the 50-year-old legislator is accused of dealings with organised crime relating to illegal refuse disposal in the naples area , which was hit by a garbage crisis last year that left tons of refuse on the streets .
however , il giornale called the arrest warrant " an attack by magistrates . "
cosentino , the leader of berlusconi 's party for the campania region around naples , was slated to be a candidate for governor in next year 's regional elections .
he has denied the accusations in a statement issued by the local party . rb / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .
ultimatum to allies berlusconi has been in combative mode since italy 's top court last month ruled that his immunity from prosecution while in office was unconstitutional .
it overturned a law passed by his government which critics said was tailor-made to protect him .

the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .
arrest warrant for berlusconi aide news that there was support for the new law came a day after the center-right government had another brush with the courts .

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .
the pope has recently started talks with the group aimed at mending fences .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.11.2009 gm picks turnaround expert as interim head of opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is hoping that reilly will see the opel recovery project through general motors has named executive vice-president nick reilly as interim head of its european business while it searches for a new chief executive for the opel unit . general motors said in a statement from its headquarters in detroit on tuesday that nick reilly , the head of the us carmaker 's international operations would " immediately assume responsibility for the operations of opel / vauxhall europe while an external search for a new ceo commences . ”
reilly , a specialist in turning around troubled operations , " will support the european leadership team in running the business and will oversee the creation of a strategy to position opel / vauxhall for long-term success , " the statement added .
former gm europe chief executive carl-peter forster is stepping down following the parent group 's decision to hang on to opel and restructure the companies itself .
forster had backed their sale to canadian auto parts maker magna and its russian partner sberbank , a plan which was backed by the german government .
paying back emergency german loans meanwhile , gm also said it has paid back 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- of a bridging loan provided by germany to keep opel running , and that it would reimburse the remaining amount before the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government pushed hard for opel 's sale to magna to save the german plants the government had granted a loan of 1.5 billion euros to tide opel over , and was set to make another three billion euros available as loan guarantees if the deal had gone through .
" we now have an outstanding balance of 600 million euros , " gm europe finance director enrico digirolamo said in a separate statement .
on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel once again insisted that berlin wanted its money back after gm chose to keep opel , a decision merkel said she " regretted enormously . "
gm was now expected to quickly submit a plan detailing how it aims to get opel back on its feet .
gm chief executive fritz henderson has said the group would need around three billion euros in financing to restructure opel , but also suggested recently that gm might have other means to fund the operation .
no guarantees on german jobs german authorities had pushed hard for opel 's sale to magna and sberbank because of assurances that no german plants would subsequently be shut down , something that gm has not guaranteed .
henderson and reilly toured opel headquarters in the town of ruesselsheim near frankfurt on tuesday and met with the head of the workers ' council , klaus franz .
no details have been released of the outcome of those talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly was previously credited with turning around daewoo " as we announced last tuesday , opel / vauxhall will remain a fully integrated member of the new gm family , a decision that is in the best interests of opel / vauxhall , its customers , employees , other stakeholders and gm , " one of the statements quoted henderson as saying .
" with his deep experience with the opel and vauxhall brands , nick is well suited to lead this transition and to work toward the earliest possible normalization of the business . "
the briton is credited with helping turn around operations at the daewoo brand in south korea in the past. rb / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.11.2009 french court rules lesbian couple can adopt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is forbidden in most european countries for gay couples to adopt in france , a homosexual couple has won the right to adopt a child , after battling the courts for 11 years .
many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .
such a move would require legislation .
but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .
" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .
such a move would require legislation .
but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .

many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .

but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .
" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .

the transaction is still subject to approval by anti-trust authorities .
" the german regional distribution grids , which form by far the largest part of e.on 's network business , are not affected by this sale and will remain an essential part of the infrastructure business managed by e.on energie in munich , " e.on said in a statement .
e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat said the deal was an important step towards the integration of europe 's electricity market .
the deal will also help the company resolve a european union investigation into whether e.on had thwarted competition .
the eu has been putting pressure on energy companies to separate production from generation in a bid to increase competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulf bernotat bernotat said that e.on has " almost completely fulfilled " its commitment to the european commission after selling its transmission network as well as 4,800 megawatts of power generation capacity .
dutch minister : " assuring security of supply " “ this takeover will help to create a north-west european electricity market in which the netherlands plays a leading role , ” maria van der hoeven , the dutch minister of economic affairs , said in a statement .
“ the integration is essential to assuring the security of supply . ”
tennet has spent a total of 776 million euros this year on buying the power networks of three dutch utilities .
the sale could complicate plans by the german government for the eventual creation of national network company , netz ag , which would bring all four of germany 's high-voltage grids together under one roof .
last week , the german subsidiary of swedish power group vattenfall , vattenfall europe , said it would also sell its electric network , but did n't provide details .
according to press reports , vattenfall is planning to sell its grid to a consortium that includes goldman sachs , deutsche bank and insurance group allianz for around 500 million euros . dc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2009 eu finance ministers grapple with budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national budget deficits must not exceed three percent european finance ministers gathered in belgium on tuesday in a bid to tackle excessive debts accumulated in the wake of the financial crisis .
failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .

the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .
arrest warrant for berlusconi aide news that there was support for the new law came a day after the center-right government had another brush with the courts .
magistrates in naples issued an arrest warrant late on monday for nicola cosentino , parliamentarian and undersecretary to economy minister giulio tremonti .

however , il giornale called the arrest warrant " an attack by magistrates . "

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .
the pope has recently started talks with the group aimed at mending fences .
it is against both german and austrian law to deny the holocaust. tkw / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .

the munich-based bank said the bad results were mainly due to its flagging austrian subsidiary , hypo group alpe adria -lrb- hgaa -rrb- , and that this was likely to impact severely on the fourth quarter .
however , looking at the first three quarters of 2009 , bayernlb was able to make good on last year 's disastrous results , posting a pretax profit of 367 million euros for the january-september period .
bank would have failed without aid the bank suffered losses of about five billion euros in 2008 and would most certainly have failed if the southern german state of bavaria had not chipped in with ten billion euros .
bayernlb said on tuesday that it did not require any additional government aid to weather the financial crisis .
however , it also said that a recapitalization of hgaa was inevitable .

general motors announced last week that opel would have to shed roughly 10,000 jobs to remain profitable , and now ceo henderson has to try to sell this plan to the staff council at opel 's german base of ruesselsheim .
" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .
henderson 's meeting with staff council head klaus franz may not be amicable .
in his previous role as opel ceo , henderson became renowned among workers for his tough job-cutting measures .
now , history is poised to repeat itself .
this is the second and final day of henderson 's trip to ruesselsheim .
on monday he met with opel leaders to discuss the company 's future .
an opel spokesman said the ceo is holding internal talks at the opel headquarters , in a bid to gain some insight into the current situation there .
out with the new due to the improving economic climate , general motors recently decided to cancel the proposed sale of opel to canadian car-parts maker magna .
this has angered the german government and local opel unions , because magna had promised to protect all five opel factories based in germany .
other opel employees throughout europe , however , have welcomed general motors ' decision .
bildunterschrift : gm 's decision to keep opel sparked protests according to the german business daily handelsblatt , the opel works council has written to the european union competition commissioner , neelie kroes , asking her to stop any job-cutting measures that are too hard on germany .
however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .
opel factories in antwerp , belgium , and bochum and eisenach , in germany , are considered the most at risk of closure during the restructuring of opel .
a freer hand ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl-peter forster quit as opel boss after gm 's u-turn the works council is also lobbying for gm to give opel greater independence in its daily running , a wish the us parent company is likely to grant .
the top short-term priority , however , is seeking out opel 's next ceo to steer the company through its restructuring process .
gm europe boss carl-peter forster , a keen backer of the magna takeover bid , stepped down after gm 's decision to keep the company .
he is now being linked with the budget indian carmaker tata .
meanwhile , henderson was to give a press conference later tuesday , elaborating on gm 's future plans for its european subsidiary .
this could be a critical moment for gm , which still hopes for state support to help fund the opel restructuring .
the german government had already pledged to help magna in its efforts , but after gm thwarted german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed solution , berlin might be unwilling to step in and help this time. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors announced last week that opel would have to shed roughly 10,000 jobs to remain profitable , and now ceo henderson has to try to sell this plan to the staff council at opel 's german base of ruesselsheim .
" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .
henderson 's meeting with staff council head klaus franz may not be amicable .
in his previous role as opel ceo , henderson became renowned among workers for his tough job-cutting measures .
now , history is poised to repeat itself .
this is the second and final day of henderson 's trip to ruesselsheim .
on monday he met with opel leaders to discuss the company 's future .
an opel spokesman said the ceo is holding internal talks at the opel headquarters , in a bid to gain some insight into the current situation there .
out with the new due to the improving economic climate , general motors recently decided to cancel the proposed sale of opel to canadian car-parts maker magna .
this has angered the german government and local opel unions , because magna had promised to protect all five opel factories based in germany .
other opel employees throughout europe , however , have welcomed general motors ' decision .
bildunterschrift : gm 's decision to keep opel sparked protests according to the german business daily handelsblatt , the opel works council has written to the european union competition commissioner , neelie kroes , asking her to stop any job-cutting measures that are too hard on germany .
however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .
opel factories in antwerp , belgium , and bochum and eisenach , in germany , are considered the most at risk of closure during the restructuring of opel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 five years after arafat 's death , a palestinian state remains elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters for palestinian president mahmoud abbas urging him to run again in january five years ago , palestinian leader yasir arafat died .
his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners arrive at auschwitz that was the night , 71 years ago , when jewish citizens and their property became the targets of mass-scale coordinated attacks across germany and austria .
knobloch said that although it was natural and quite right for germany to be focusing so sharply on the events of two decades ago , it was also important to mark both occasions appropriately in the future .
speaking in munich on monday , she said the desecration of a synagoge in the city of dresden , which was sprayed with swastikas a day before the reunification celebrations , clearly demonstrated that antisemitism and public incitement were " a serious problem . "
nazi thinking , she added , " has seeped into all areas of society . "
she said 550 antisemitic crimes had been committed across germany in the first half of this year , and stressed the importance of making sure young people are aware of history .
paving the road to auschwitz while the night of november 9 , 1989 , signalled the opening of the gates to freedom for east germans , knobloch said , the same night 51 years earlier had paved the way to auschwitz .
germany has to show that it " is committed to the basic democratic values - with an awareness of the darkest chapter in its history . "
kristallnacht commemoration ceremonies were held across germany and president horst koehler , who was attending a 20-year anniversary service in berlin , urged the congregation not to forget 1938 .
he said the two historic dates were connected , and that germany had survived the division " because we have learned the necessary lessons from our history between 1933 and 1945 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burned out ruins of a berlin synagogue after kristallnacht , 1938 koehler added that germany would forever remember the link between the two dates .
systematic destruction and brutality during kristallnacht , german forces and the hitler youth took sledgehammers to jewish homes and business and destroyed at least 200 synagogues .
they murdered some ninety jews and arrested as many as 30,000 , who were then transported to concentration camps .
those imprisoned were largely healthy young men , and they were subjected to systematic and often fatal brutality .
most were released within three months of their arrest on condition that they leave germany , but by that time more than 2,000 had already died .

many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .
such a move would require legislation .
but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .
" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.11.2009 french court rules lesbian couple can adopt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is forbidden in most european countries for gay couples to adopt in france , a homosexual couple has won the right to adopt a child , after battling the courts for 11 years .
many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .
such a move would require legislation .
but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .
" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

reilly , a specialist in turning around troubled operations , " will support the european leadership team in running the business and will oversee the creation of a strategy to position opel / vauxhall for long-term success , " the statement added .
former gm europe chief executive carl-peter forster is stepping down following the parent group 's decision to hang on to opel and restructure the companies itself .
forster had backed their sale to canadian auto parts maker magna and its russian partner sberbank , a plan which was backed by the german government .
paying back emergency german loans meanwhile , gm also said it has paid back 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- of a bridging loan provided by germany to keep opel running , and that it would reimburse the remaining amount before the end of the month .

on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel once again insisted that berlin wanted its money back after gm chose to keep opel , a decision merkel said she " regretted enormously . "
gm was now expected to quickly submit a plan detailing how it aims to get opel back on its feet .
gm chief executive fritz henderson has said the group would need around three billion euros in financing to restructure opel , but also suggested recently that gm might have other means to fund the operation .
no guarantees on german jobs german authorities had pushed hard for opel 's sale to magna and sberbank because of assurances that no german plants would subsequently be shut down , something that gm has not guaranteed .
henderson and reilly toured opel headquarters in the town of ruesselsheim near frankfurt on tuesday and met with the head of the workers ' council , klaus franz .

the transaction is still subject to approval by anti-trust authorities .
" the german regional distribution grids , which form by far the largest part of e.on 's network business , are not affected by this sale and will remain an essential part of the infrastructure business managed by e.on energie in munich , " e.on said in a statement .
e.on 's ceo wulf bernotat said the deal was an important step towards the integration of europe 's electricity market .
the deal will also help the company resolve a european union investigation into whether e.on had thwarted competition .
the eu has been putting pressure on energy companies to separate production from generation in a bid to increase competition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wulf bernotat bernotat said that e.on has " almost completely fulfilled " its commitment to the european commission after selling its transmission network as well as 4,800 megawatts of power generation capacity .
dutch minister : " assuring security of supply " “ this takeover will help to create a north-west european electricity market in which the netherlands plays a leading role , ” maria van der hoeven , the dutch minister of economic affairs , said in a statement .
“ the integration is essential to assuring the security of supply . ”
tennet has spent a total of 776 million euros this year on buying the power networks of three dutch utilities .
the sale could complicate plans by the german government for the eventual creation of national network company , netz ag , which would bring all four of germany 's high-voltage grids together under one roof .
last week , the german subsidiary of swedish power group vattenfall , vattenfall europe , said it would also sell its electric network , but did n't provide details .
according to press reports , vattenfall is planning to sell its grid to a consortium that includes goldman sachs , deutsche bank and insurance group allianz for around 500 million euros . dc / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners arrive at auschwitz that was the night , 71 years ago , when jewish citizens and their property became the targets of mass-scale coordinated attacks across germany and austria .
knobloch said that although it was natural and quite right for germany to be focusing so sharply on the events of two decades ago , it was also important to mark both occasions appropriately in the future .
speaking in munich on monday , she said the desecration of a synagoge in the city of dresden , which was sprayed with swastikas a day before the reunification celebrations , clearly demonstrated that antisemitism and public incitement were " a serious problem . "
nazi thinking , she added , " has seeped into all areas of society . "
she said 550 antisemitic crimes had been committed across germany in the first half of this year , and stressed the importance of making sure young people are aware of history .
paving the road to auschwitz while the night of november 9 , 1989 , signalled the opening of the gates to freedom for east germans , knobloch said , the same night 51 years earlier had paved the way to auschwitz .
germany has to show that it " is committed to the basic democratic values - with an awareness of the darkest chapter in its history . "
kristallnacht commemoration ceremonies were held across germany and president horst koehler , who was attending a 20-year anniversary service in berlin , urged the congregation not to forget 1938 .
he said the two historic dates were connected , and that germany had survived the division " because we have learned the necessary lessons from our history between 1933 and 1945 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burned out ruins of a berlin synagogue after kristallnacht , 1938 koehler added that germany would forever remember the link between the two dates .
systematic destruction and brutality during kristallnacht , german forces and the hitler youth took sledgehammers to jewish homes and business and destroyed at least 200 synagogues .
they murdered some ninety jews and arrested as many as 30,000 , who were then transported to concentration camps .
those imprisoned were largely healthy young men , and they were subjected to systematic and often fatal brutality .
most were released within three months of their arrest on condition that they leave germany , but by that time more than 2,000 had already died .
november 9 , 1938 has always been seen as a major turning point in the treatment of jews in nazi germany , and has often been referred to as the start of the holocaust. tkw / reuters / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 10.11.2009 french court rules lesbian couple can adopt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is forbidden in most european countries for gay couples to adopt in france , a homosexual couple has won the right to adopt a child , after battling the courts for 11 years .
many have hailed the ruling as unprecedented , while others say it does n't go far enough . emmanuelle b. is a 48 year-old nursery school teacher .
her partner , laurence r. is a child psychologist .
for eleven years they 've been trying to adopt , but each time they applied they were turned down by country authorities in the jura mountain region , near the swiss border , where they reside . to justify their refusal , the authorities said the child would lack a father figure .
it is an argument that might seem to be in the spirit of french legislation , which does not allow same-sex couples to adopt .
however , emmanuelle b. was not applying for the right to adopt with her partner as a couple .
she was applying on her own as an unmarried person . in france , single people are allowed to adopt - a very significant loophole .
as the administrative tribunal in the eastern town of besancon has now found , refusing emmanuelle b. 's application on the grounds of her sexuality was discriminatory . " i want to see the authorities take a stance on this issue .
is the jura ready - yes or no - to allow adoption by a woman who is in a homosexual relationship ? " emmanuelle b. asked .
a long-awaited victory the answer on tuesday morning was yes . the decision by the administrative tribunal follows a ruling by the european court of justice , which favored the women and condemned france .
once emmanuelle b. has re-applied for adoption , the authorities will have 15 days to give a positive response or they 'll run the risk of being sued .
" i hope that with this judgment the debate can at long last be brought to an end so that unmarried people , whether they are heterosexual or homosexual , can be allowed to adopt without their sexuality being thrown in their faces , " said emmanuelle b. 's lawyer , caroline mecaray .
in france , as in most european countries , homosexual couples are still not allowed to adopt .
such a move would require legislation .
but , for those applauding the court decision on tuesday , this at least means an end to a certain sort of hypocrisy .
it will no longer be necessary for a gay man or woman to hide his or her partner when it comes to putting his or her name down as a prospective parent of an adopted child .
but for some , the ruling does not go far enough .
ruling sparks debate " it 's a victory , that 's for sure , but we 've got to go further , " said philippe rolondin , honorary president of the gay and lesbian parents association .
" we need new legislation that clearly states that homosexual couples can adopt and that the selection criteria are the same for all .
also , we 've got to be vigilant because at the moment it 's a sort of lottery .
in some parts of france , the authorities do n't take account of sexual orientation .
in others , they do . "
government spokesman luc chatel addressed reporters after the weekly cabinet meeting .
" the government and the president have on several occasions expressed our position which is that we are not in favor of the adoption of children by same-sex couples , " he said .
" a legal ruling has been handed down .
well , we have to take note and i think it should contribute to our thinking on the subject , " chatel added .

reilly , a specialist in turning around troubled operations , " will support the european leadership team in running the business and will oversee the creation of a strategy to position opel / vauxhall for long-term success , " the statement added .
former gm europe chief executive carl-peter forster is stepping down following the parent group 's decision to hang on to opel and restructure the companies itself .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the goal of the study was to ascertain where disparities in medical care between men and women and over a woman 's lifetime continue to persist .
according to the 91-page report , " women who do not know how to protect themselves from such infections , or who are unable to do so , face increased risk of death or illness . "
in developing countries , up to one in five women die of hiv / aids , with unsafe sex being the highest risk factor .
pregnancy-related complications were also among the primary causes of death , killing around 500,000 women per year ; 99 percent of them are in developing countries .

" today we want to say welcome – warmly welcome excellency thaksin in cambodia . "
with those words cambodian government spokesman phay siphan announced early tuesday that thailand ’ s former premier thaksin shinawatra had landed in phnom penh at the express invitation of the cambodian government .
thaksin ’ s arrival was expected – he is scheduled to address a meeting of cambodian economists later this week .
thailand ’ s response was predictable too : the thai cabinet voted to tear up a memorandum of understanding between the two nations that dealt with their overlapping claims in the gulf of thailand .
it was less than a week ago that thailand expressed outrage after cambodia appointed thaksin to two advisory positions – one as an economic adviser to the government ; the other as a personal adviser to cambodian prime minister hun sen. not ready to extradite thaksin the thai government says thaksin , who was sentenced to two years in jail but fled beforehand , must serve his time there .
thaksin ’ s sentence came after he was forced from office in a coup in 2006 .
but cambodia has repeatedly said there is no way it will honour an extradition treaty with thailand should it apply for thaksin ’ s extradition .
it ’ s not clear at this stage how long thaksin will stay in cambodia – perhaps just a few days .
but the visit and the appointments have seriously damaged relations between the two nations – both of which have withdrawn their respective ambassadors .
cambodian government spokesman phay siphan reiterated that thaksin is here solely to provide advice on economic matters , and that cambodian law precludes him from any political activity .
" you must understand that cambodia will not allow anyone to do politics in the territory of cambodia as stated by our constitution " , he said .
hun sen banking on thaksin election victory ?
it ’ s a message phnom penh has stressed for days now , along with official denials that hun sen is looking to next year ’ s thai election which thaksin ’ s people could well win .
bangkok has no doubt that is part of hun sen ’ s strategy .
even in phnom penh you don ’ t have to try very hard to hear that .
cheang vannarith is the executive director of the cambodian institute for cooperation and peace , a political research body .
he says hun sen is well aware thaksin ’ s group could win the election .
rebuilding relations between the two countries can probably wait until then .
cheang vannarith says problems between the two nations stem from bangkok , and means the solution needs to be found there too .
and although the political temperature keeps rising , cheang vannarith does not believe there is any danger of conflict .
both sides , he says , will keep their mutual economic interests in the forefront .
as a billionaire businessman , that ’ s a message thaksin himself would doubtless understand .

" today we want to say welcome – warmly welcome excellency thaksin in cambodia . "
with those words cambodian government spokesman phay siphan announced early tuesday that thailand ’ s former premier thaksin shinawatra had landed in phnom penh at the express invitation of the cambodian government .
thaksin ’ s arrival was expected – he is scheduled to address a meeting of cambodian economists later this week .
thailand ’ s response was predictable too : the thai cabinet voted to tear up a memorandum of understanding between the two nations that dealt with their overlapping claims in the gulf of thailand .
it was less than a week ago that thailand expressed outrage after cambodia appointed thaksin to two advisory positions – one as an economic adviser to the government ; the other as a personal adviser to cambodian prime minister hun sen. not ready to extradite thaksin the thai government says thaksin , who was sentenced to two years in jail but fled beforehand , must serve his time there .
thaksin ’ s sentence came after he was forced from office in a coup in 2006 .
but cambodia has repeatedly said there is no way it will honour an extradition treaty with thailand should it apply for thaksin ’ s extradition .
it ’ s not clear at this stage how long thaksin will stay in cambodia – perhaps just a few days .
but the visit and the appointments have seriously damaged relations between the two nations – both of which have withdrawn their respective ambassadors .
cambodian government spokesman phay siphan reiterated that thaksin is here solely to provide advice on economic matters , and that cambodian law precludes him from any political activity .
" you must understand that cambodia will not allow anyone to do politics in the territory of cambodia as stated by our constitution " , he said .
hun sen banking on thaksin election victory ?
it ’ s a message phnom penh has stressed for days now , along with official denials that hun sen is looking to next year ’ s thai election which thaksin ’ s people could well win .
bangkok has no doubt that is part of hun sen ’ s strategy .
even in phnom penh you don ’ t have to try very hard to hear that .
cheang vannarith is the executive director of the cambodian institute for cooperation and peace , a political research body .
he says hun sen is well aware thaksin ’ s group could win the election .
rebuilding relations between the two countries can probably wait until then .

they prefer to take some time off to discover the world and themselves - and many like to do something useful at the same time .
for example with the german development ministry 's volunteers service " weltwärts " - which means something like " world-wards " , or " into the world " .
last year , more than 2200 young people went to asia , africa or latin america as volonteers as part of this programme .
this year , the figures will double .
since september , the first volunteers have been serving in mongolia 's capital ulan bator . a road junction at the centre of ulan bator .
blowing his whistle and waving his baton , a policeman is trying to bring some order into the chaos of old russian cars , new small japanese cars , luxurious suvs and korean-made buses which are all bent upon passing through at the same time .
" so many impressions have really been overwhelming in my first two weeks here " , says stefan schulze .
" food culture , people 's looks , their behaviour .
everything is so different - the traffic to begin with , which you can not compare to germany .
it 's a major event to cross the road here every time . " 20 year old stefan schulze is from leverkusen near cologne .
in september he moved to ulan bator , the capital of mongolia .
" i work at the lotus children centre .
it is an orphanage for street children and other orphans .

education is the field where most volunteers are posted in the " weltwärts " programme .
more than 200 german institutions are taking part in the programme .
the development ministry pays about 600 euros per month for each volunteer .
stefan schulze was sent to ulan bator by the german development service or ded .
he is one of 16 youngsters there .
claudia polzer who is in charge of ded work in mongolia says that in ulan bator , too , most of the volunteers work in the education sector .
for the ded , one thing is important , she adds : " to find partners who speak german or english .
which is not such an issue in ulan bator , there are many mongolians who speak one of these languages .
our volunteers do n't have a translator with them .
so at least some people in the partner organizations need to be able to communicate with them . "
bridging the language gap but the germans are also expected to do their bit to overcome the language gap .
18 year old peter benedikt von niebelschütz explains : " in our introductory week we also had a crash course in the language - every afternoon a couple of hours of mongolian .
i 've remembered and mastered at least the numbers , the phrases for greeting and goodbye - and directions . "
basic mongolian also comes in handy for communicating with the host families , where most of the german teenagers stay .
in stefan schulze 's family , not much english is spoken - which he sees as an advantage : " it 's quite good .
i 've met so many mongolians and my mongolian is slowly improving . "
confronted with poverty about his expectations from his first year in mongolia stefan schulze says , " gathering many new experiences and broadening my horizon by seeing the world beyond the industrial countries ! "
which also includes some rather unpleasant sights .
21 year old maria recalls an irritating experience : " yesterday i saw something not so nice , a man climbing out of a manhole , because they live down there . "
ulan bator , as the coldest capital of the world , is criss-crossed by underground heating pipes .
about 10,000 people seek shelter in the tunnels every night .
many of them are street children - like those whom stefan schulze is teaching english now .

in september he moved to ulan bator , the capital of mongolia .
" i work at the lotus children centre .

education is the field where most volunteers are posted in the " weltwärts " programme .
more than 200 german institutions are taking part in the programme .
the development ministry pays about 600 euros per month for each volunteer .
stefan schulze was sent to ulan bator by the german development service or ded .
he is one of 16 youngsters there .
claudia polzer who is in charge of ded work in mongolia says that in ulan bator , too , most of the volunteers work in the education sector .
for the ded , one thing is important , she adds : " to find partners who speak german or english .
which is not such an issue in ulan bator , there are many mongolians who speak one of these languages .
our volunteers do n't have a translator with them .
so at least some people in the partner organizations need to be able to communicate with them . "
bridging the language gap but the germans are also expected to do their bit to overcome the language gap .
18 year old peter benedikt von niebelschütz explains : " in our introductory week we also had a crash course in the language - every afternoon a couple of hours of mongolian .
i 've remembered and mastered at least the numbers , the phrases for greeting and goodbye - and directions . "
basic mongolian also comes in handy for communicating with the host families , where most of the german teenagers stay .
in stefan schulze 's family , not much english is spoken - which he sees as an advantage : " it 's quite good .
i 've met so many mongolians and my mongolian is slowly improving . "
confronted with poverty about his expectations from his first year in mongolia stefan schulze says , " gathering many new experiences and broadening my horizon by seeing the world beyond the industrial countries ! "
which also includes some rather unpleasant sights .
21 year old maria recalls an irritating experience : " yesterday i saw something not so nice , a man climbing out of a manhole , because they live down there . "
ulan bator , as the coldest capital of the world , is criss-crossed by underground heating pipes .
about 10,000 people seek shelter in the tunnels every night .
many of them are street children - like those whom stefan schulze is teaching english now .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 10.11.2009 " adviser " thaksin arrives in cambodia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thaksin , right , with cambodian premier hun sen after his arrival thailand ’ s former premier thaksin shinawatra arrived in cambodia early on tuesday to the huge annoyance of the country ’ s bigger neighbour . " today we want to say welcome – warmly welcome excellency thaksin in cambodia . "
with those words cambodian government spokesman phay siphan announced early tuesday that thailand ’ s former premier thaksin shinawatra had landed in phnom penh at the express invitation of the cambodian government .
thaksin ’ s arrival was expected – he is scheduled to address a meeting of cambodian economists later this week .
thailand ’ s response was predictable too : the thai cabinet voted to tear up a memorandum of understanding between the two nations that dealt with their overlapping claims in the gulf of thailand .
it was less than a week ago that thailand expressed outrage after cambodia appointed thaksin to two advisory positions – one as an economic adviser to the government ; the other as a personal adviser to cambodian prime minister hun sen. not ready to extradite thaksin the thai government says thaksin , who was sentenced to two years in jail but fled beforehand , must serve his time there .
thaksin ’ s sentence came after he was forced from office in a coup in 2006 .
but cambodia has repeatedly said there is no way it will honour an extradition treaty with thailand should it apply for thaksin ’ s extradition .
it ’ s not clear at this stage how long thaksin will stay in cambodia – perhaps just a few days .
but the visit and the appointments have seriously damaged relations between the two nations – both of which have withdrawn their respective ambassadors .
cambodian government spokesman phay siphan reiterated that thaksin is here solely to provide advice on economic matters , and that cambodian law precludes him from any political activity .
" you must understand that cambodia will not allow anyone to do politics in the territory of cambodia as stated by our constitution " , he said .
hun sen banking on thaksin election victory ?
it ’ s a message phnom penh has stressed for days now , along with official denials that hun sen is looking to next year ’ s thai election which thaksin ’ s people could well win .
bangkok has no doubt that is part of hun sen ’ s strategy .
even in phnom penh you don ’ t have to try very hard to hear that .
cheang vannarith is the executive director of the cambodian institute for cooperation and peace , a political research body .
he says hun sen is well aware thaksin ’ s group could win the election .
rebuilding relations between the two countries can probably wait until then .
cheang vannarith says problems between the two nations stem from bangkok , and means the solution needs to be found there too .
and although the political temperature keeps rising , cheang vannarith does not believe there is any danger of conflict .
both sides , he says , will keep their mutual economic interests in the forefront .
as a billionaire businessman , that ’ s a message thaksin himself would doubtless understand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prisoners arrive at auschwitz that was the night , 71 years ago , when jewish citizens and their property became the targets of mass-scale coordinated attacks across germany and austria .
knobloch said that although it was natural and quite right for germany to be focusing so sharply on the events of two decades ago , it was also important to mark both occasions appropriately in the future .
speaking in munich on monday , she said the desecration of a synagoge in the city of dresden , which was sprayed with swastikas a day before the reunification celebrations , clearly demonstrated that antisemitism and public incitement were " a serious problem . "
nazi thinking , she added , " has seeped into all areas of society . "
she said 550 antisemitic crimes had been committed across germany in the first half of this year , and stressed the importance of making sure young people are aware of history .
paving the road to auschwitz while the night of november 9 , 1989 , signalled the opening of the gates to freedom for east germans , knobloch said , the same night 51 years earlier had paved the way to auschwitz .
germany has to show that it " is committed to the basic democratic values - with an awareness of the darkest chapter in its history . "
kristallnacht commemoration ceremonies were held across germany and president horst koehler , who was attending a 20-year anniversary service in berlin , urged the congregation not to forget 1938 .
he said the two historic dates were connected , and that germany had survived the division " because we have learned the necessary lessons from our history between 1933 and 1945 . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the burned out ruins of a berlin synagogue after kristallnacht , 1938 koehler added that germany would forever remember the link between the two dates .
systematic destruction and brutality during kristallnacht , german forces and the hitler youth took sledgehammers to jewish homes and business and destroyed at least 200 synagogues .
they murdered some ninety jews and arrested as many as 30,000 , who were then transported to concentration camps .
those imprisoned were largely healthy young men , and they were subjected to systematic and often fatal brutality .
most were released within three months of their arrest on condition that they leave germany , but by that time more than 2,000 had already died .
november 9 , 1938 has always been seen as a major turning point in the treatment of jews in nazi germany , and has often been referred to as the start of the holocaust. tkw / reuters / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 five years after arafat 's death , a palestinian state remains elusive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : supporters for palestinian president mahmoud abbas urging him to run again in january five years ago , palestinian leader yasir arafat died .
his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .
bildunterschrift : yasser arafat -lrb- l -rrb- and his successor , abbas while arafat 's militant past always made him a controversial figure and he was mistrusted by many at the various negotiating tables , he was able to act as an historic symbol which brought all palestinians together in at least a nominal way , according to blecher .
" but after he died there was no historic figure left that could unite the palestinian flag , " he said .
abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

abbas - once a new hope still , at the outset , many had put their hopes in mahmoud abbas , who was elected president of the palestinian authority in 2005 and hailed by the americans and israelis not only for wearing suits instead of military fatigues , but for condemning palestinian military actions against israel as " terrorism " and calling the second intifada wrong .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abbas ' announcement to not run for reelection could be tactical maneuvering , experts say but under his watch , the palestinian movement has fractured and his bitter rivals , hamas , control the gaza strip , while he and his fatah movement administer palestinian affairs in the occupied west bank .
while he has based his career on peace talks and believes there can be peace with israel if the international community accepts a palestinian state based on 1967 borders and with east jerusalem as its capital , those hopes have recently been dealt a critical blow .
israel under prime minister benjamin netanyahu has refused to freeze west bank settlements and in a turnaround by washington , us secretary of state hillary clinton dropped that requirement on israel and urged abbas to begin negotiations anyway .
stepping aside ?
some analysts says it was this sense of betrayal on various sides that led abbas last week to announce he did not want to run for reelection in a vote scheduled for january . " this shrinking us support indicates that president abbas no longer sees a solution to the conflict and therefore wants to step down , " jochen hippler of the institute for development and peace at the university of duisburg , told deutsche welle .
" but there will be a lot of pressure from washington and others for him to remain a candidate . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president obama meets with israeli prime minister netanyahu -lrb- l -rrb- and abbas that partly has to do with the fact that there are few people set to step into his shoes as leader of fatah ; abbas has groomed no protege .
the most talked-about figure is marwan barghouti , but he is serving five life sentences in an israeli jail for murder and the israelis have indicated they will not release him even if he were elected .
other analysts and palestinians in the west bank , however , say that abbas ' decision not to run is a tactical move , despite his insistence to the contrary . " he could use this as an opportunity to pressure the americans and indirectly , israel , because he needs to do something to shake up the diplomatic equation , because it 's not playing to his favor , " said blecher of the international crisis group .
anyway , he added , many people do not expect the elections to take place anyway .
abbas ' palestinian rivals , hamas , say the vote would be illegal and that they would not take part .
standstill what is next for the region is unclear to observers .
analyst hippler describes it as a " civil war on ice " that will not move in any direction unless the united states stays involved and puts pressure on israel to make concessions on the settlement issue .
only then , will abbas return to the negotiating table .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : success regarding palestine depends on us involvement , analysts say but even if he does , the question of hamas and its role looms large .
while abbas might be an appealing figure to many in the west bank and the americans , he holds no sway over hamas and the gaza strip .
" there is simply no clear successor that a critical mass of people could coalesce around right now , " blecher said .
on the ground in jerusalem , he said ordinary people there are just weary of the back and forth , the recriminations , the violence and a political process that locks them out .
" it 's worse than people feeling despair .
it 's beyond that , " he said .
political scientist hippler agreed , but warned that the paralysis could lead to a radicalization on both sides as people lose hope in a political solution , which seems as far away as ever .
" this can lead to young men saying ' we 've tried it with negotiations , and that failed .
we ca n't do it through military means , israel is too strong .
so the only way is to go down with dignity , and to bring some of our enemies with us ' , " he said .

his successor , mahmoud abbas , was hailed as one who could bolster mideast peace prospects .
but today , a palestinian state alongside israel is far out of reach . despite the endless rounds of shuttle diplomacy , top-level summits , and highly staged photo ops with bitter foes shaking hands and smiling , peace between palestinians and israel and the establishment of a palestinian state appears little more than a pipedream - a plan on paper with little connection to reality .
five years ago this wednesday , long-time palestinian leader yasser arafat died in paris at the age of 75 , after being confined for years to his compound in ramallah by then-israeli prime minister ariel sharon for allegedly instigating suicide attacks in israel , part of the so-called second intifada .
at the time , israel said arafat 's death could signal a turning point for peace in the middle east .
but five years on , that does not appear to be the case .
" no , we 're not any closer to peace and arguably , we 're much further away , " robert blecher , a jerusalem-based senior analyst for the international crisis group , told deutsche welle .
instead , palestinians have split into two movements , hamas and fatah , who harbor a good deal of animosity toward one another .
israel now has a right-wing government , which has shown little interest in making concessions to the palestinians at the negotiating table .
the united states under president barack obama , once seen as a beacon of hope after the years of relative inactivity of the bush administration , has recently dropped its demands that israel pull back its settlements in the west bank , a major thorn in the side of palestinians .

general motors announced last week that opel would have to shed roughly 10,000 jobs to remain profitable , and now ceo henderson has to try to sell this plan to the staff council at opel 's german base of ruesselsheim .
" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .
henderson 's meeting with staff council head klaus franz may not be amicable .
in his previous role as opel ceo , henderson became renowned among workers for his tough job-cutting measures .
now , history is poised to repeat itself .
this is the second and final day of henderson 's trip to ruesselsheim .
on monday he met with opel leaders to discuss the company 's future .
an opel spokesman said the ceo is holding internal talks at the opel headquarters , in a bid to gain some insight into the current situation there .
out with the new due to the improving economic climate , general motors recently decided to cancel the proposed sale of opel to canadian car-parts maker magna .
this has angered the german government and local opel unions , because magna had promised to protect all five opel factories based in germany .
other opel employees throughout europe , however , have welcomed general motors ' decision .
bildunterschrift : gm 's decision to keep opel sparked protests according to the german business daily handelsblatt , the opel works council has written to the european union competition commissioner , neelie kroes , asking her to stop any job-cutting measures that are too hard on germany .
however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .
opel factories in antwerp , belgium , and bochum and eisenach , in germany , are considered the most at risk of closure during the restructuring of opel .

gm europe boss carl-peter forster , a keen backer of the magna takeover bid , stepped down after gm 's decision to keep the company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 10.11.2009 eu finance ministers grapple with budget deficits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : national budget deficits must not exceed three percent european finance ministers gathered in belgium on tuesday in a bid to tackle excessive debts accumulated in the wake of the financial crisis .
failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .

the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .
arrest warrant for berlusconi aide news that there was support for the new law came a day after the center-right government had another brush with the courts .
magistrates in naples issued an arrest warrant late on monday for nicola cosentino , parliamentarian and undersecretary to economy minister giulio tremonti .

some media reports said the 50-year-old legislator is accused of dealings with organised crime relating to illegal refuse disposal in the naples area , which was hit by a garbage crisis last year that left tons of refuse on the streets .
however , il giornale called the arrest warrant " an attack by magistrates . "
cosentino , the leader of berlusconi 's party for the campania region around naples , was slated to be a candidate for governor in next year 's regional elections .

but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .

it overturned a law passed by his government which critics said was tailor-made to protect him .

the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .

but will the proposed measure help the italian premier ? the speaker of the lower house of the italian parliament , gianfranco fini , said on tuesday after meeting prime minister silvio berlusconi that a draft law putting time limits on trials – one of berlusconi 's key demands in his fight against judges who he says are biased against him – would be presented soon .
fini said the draft law would impose a six year limit on the three stages of court cases - initial trial , first appeal , and final appeal .
he said this could be ready in a matter of days but did not comment on whether the law would impact cases against berlusconi .
trials in italy can last for more than a decade .
observers say the law could apply to some of the prime minister 's trials , depending on when it comes into effect and its retroactivity .
senator anna finocchiaro of the opposition democratic party said she was waiting to see the details of the new law .
the opposition says berlusconi 's real aim is to regain his own immunity and be shielded from upcoming trials .
ultimatum to allies berlusconi has been in combative mode since italy 's top court last month ruled that his immunity from prosecution while in office was unconstitutional .
it overturned a law passed by his government which critics said was tailor-made to protect him .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestors , who accused berlusconi of trying to silence critical voices , held a rally in rome last month the law grants immunity from prosecution to the country 's four top office holders while in office , including the premier , the president of the republic and the two parliamentary speakers berlusconi has since demanded that his allies commit themselves to protecting him from what he calls an onslaught by " communist " magistrates and judges . on sunday , il giornale , the newspaper owned by the berlusconi family , issued an ultimatum to his allies , saying they must back laws shielding the prime minister from court trials or risk a government collapse . the front-page headline of the newspaper read : " berlusconi ultimatum : those who do n't agree are out of the pdl , " referring to his people of freedom coalition .
the report said the next few days could be a " a week of passion " for the coalition and could lead to the government 's resignation and early general elections . after last month 's court ruling , corruption trials against the 73-year-old prime minister that had been suspended will now either resume where they left off or start afresh .
one , which involved the acquisition of tv rights by mediaset , his television empire , had been due to resume on november 16th , but berlusconi 's lawyers have informed the court that he will not be able to attend because of a world food summit in rome .
arrest warrant for berlusconi aide news that there was support for the new law came a day after the center-right government had another brush with the courts .

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de middle east -pipe- 10.11.2009 yemen conflict spills across border großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the yemeni government 's actions has intensified the conflict the central government faces challenges from rebels in the north and south .
economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .

economic neglect and religious marginalization are to blame , say experts .
now , the eu , the us are worried yemen might turn into a failed state . the conflict between the government and rebels in yemen has escalated further over the past few days and is showing signs of spreading into neighboring saudi arabia .
shi 'a rebels crossed the border into the territory of yemen 's large northern neighbor last week and killed one saudi soldier .
in response the saudi air force has started bombing alleged positions of yemeni rebels along the rugged border between the two countries , saudi arabia said .
the cross-border fighting marks the latest escalation in the ongoing fight of the houthi rebels in the saada region in northern yemen and the country 's saudi backed central government .
the houthi , named after one of their previous leaders , are a group comprised of zaidi shi 'ite muslims .
they launched their revolt in 2004 complaining of economic and political marginalisation of their region in the poor country at the southern rim of the arab peninsula .
the rebels also accuse the central government in the northern city of sana 'a of corruption and are opposed to the country 's alliance with the united states .
religious marginalization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : president ali abdullah saleh relies on us and saudi support however , rebel action also reflects general unhappiness among the zaidis over religious marginalisation , said gerd nonneman , a gulf expert at chatham house in london .
there is " increasing annoyance at the inroads made - with government connivance - by saudi-style wahabi teachings in the region , " he told deutsche welle , adding that the growing houthi resistance , if anything , made the yemeni government rely even more heavily on saudi support - raising the profile of wahabi influence further .
but the rebellion in yemen 's northern most region is not the only challenge confronting the government of president ali abdullah saleh , himself a zaidi .
activists in the south of the country similarly complain of economic neglect and political discrimination by the central government and threaten a resecession of the region - southern yemen was a separate nation until unification with the north in 1990 .
southern accusations are a particularly delicate issue , because saleh , in power for more then three decades , headed northern yemen prior to unification and crushed one southern secession attempt in 1994 .
fighting in the sa 'dah region has flared up intermittently since the revolt broke out five years ago , but intensified significantly when the government began a push against the rebels in august .
as many as 175,000 people have now been displaced or affected by the fighting , say aid agencies .
the unhcr said that fighting had killed a number of refugees in a regional camp .
the un agency is also looking into potential civilian victims of saudi air strikes .
saudi and yemen play on iran fears bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the houthi rebels are fighting the government in yemen 's northern sa 'dah region the saudi kingdom is dominating the region and has so far relied on its oil-fuelled economic primacy and diplomacy to wield quiet but effective power .
resorting to military means is unusual , but may be indicative of saudi angst over growing influence of its chief rival in the region - iran , said heiko wimmen , an expert for the region at the german institute for international and security affairs .
the saudis accuse the yemeni houthi rebels of receiving support from iran and the yemeni government claims a ship seized off the country 's coast at the end of october carried iranian arms .
" the saudis see themselves as being encircled by iranian pawns - or at least that is the message they are trying to sell , " wimmen told deutsche welle .
the yemeni government , on the other hand uses the claim of iranian involvement " to attract support from saudi arabia and the us , " explained nonneman .
but even if the saudi response is mere strategic maneuvering rather than reflecting an actual iranian threat , the long term prospect that the ongoing internal conflict may set its southern neighbor on a path to disintegration is not palatable no anyone in the region .
and neither to western governments .
eu and us worries over failed state the european union last week issued a statement expressing concern over the " deteriorating security , political and economic situation across the country " and called on the government to protect human rights .
both the eu and the us are worried over the " risk that yemen may become something of a failed state and an uncontrolled space where regional jihadis may find refuge and a launch platform " , said nonneman .
the effect this might have on neighboring saudi arabia also raises concerns in western capitals over oil security .
the fear of yemen becoming a haven for rogue groups is compounded by the country 's strategic significance , said wimmen .
the gulf of aden , wedged between yemen and somalia , is an important shipping route .
there are already enough problems with somali pirates in those waters , said wimmen .
" but all sorts of unwanted groups turning yemen into a base for their operations would make matters much worse , " he added .
rethink development aid , get conflict parties to talk but just what could europeans do in concrete terms to improve the situation in yemen ?
development aid is a good starting point , said wimmen .
as one of the poorest countries in the arab world , yemen is dependent on development aid .
eu planning has committed 60 million euros -lrb- $ 89 million -rrb- to yemen between 2007 and 2010 .
according to eu figures almost half of this is earmarked for the private economic sector and less than an eighth go into local community development .
the distribution of aid moneys may have to be reconsidered , said wimmen , because the complaints of rebels in the north and activists in the south are also a clear sign that the central government has neglected the periphery .
" committing the yemen government to using aid money more evenly across the country may help , " he said .
it is important to seriously invest in the northern region 's infrastructure , agreed nonneman .
but this must happen as an integral part of an attempt at a political settlement , he damanded .
it is important to persuade the us , saudi arabia , the yemeni government and egypt to treat the problem in yemen 's north not " as a proxy-war with iran " and " return to the negotiating table on the basis of what had already been discussed and nearly led to a settlement in 2008 -lsb- … -rsb- – which was blocked by the saudis , " said nonneman . author : ranty islam editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .

his decision means the case will now go to trial . the british bishop , richard williamson , has denied the charges brought against him and has refused to pay the 12,000 euro -lrb- $ 18,000 -rrb- fine imposed by the court in the german city of regensburg .
as a consequence , the court has now summoned the bishop to stand trial , although a spokesman for the court said no date had yet been set .
williamson , however , will not have to appear in person .
he can instead opt to appoint a lawyer to act on his behalf .
the court ordered the ultra-conservative bishop , a member of the society of saint pius x , to pay the fine after he claimed in an interview conducted in germany that " not one jew " had been killed in the gas chambers .
the interview , which was broadcast on swedish television , showed the bishop saying " it was all lies , lies , lies " .
the public prosecutors say williamson was trying to cause a furore in germany , and is guilty of incitement to racial hatred .
german chancellor angela merkel responded to the interview by calling on pope benedict xvi to " clarify unambiguously that there can be no denial " of the fact that six million jews died under the nazi regime .
the traditionalist society of saint pius x is a catholic splinter group which sprung up in the 1960s following disagreements over supposedly liberal changes proposed by the vatican .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 10.11.2009 gm picks turnaround expert as interim head of opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm is hoping that reilly will see the opel recovery project through general motors has named executive vice-president nick reilly as interim head of its european business while it searches for a new chief executive for the opel unit . general motors said in a statement from its headquarters in detroit on tuesday that nick reilly , the head of the us carmaker 's international operations would " immediately assume responsibility for the operations of opel / vauxhall europe while an external search for a new ceo commences . ”
reilly , a specialist in turning around troubled operations , " will support the european leadership team in running the business and will oversee the creation of a strategy to position opel / vauxhall for long-term success , " the statement added .
former gm europe chief executive carl-peter forster is stepping down following the parent group 's decision to hang on to opel and restructure the companies itself .
forster had backed their sale to canadian auto parts maker magna and its russian partner sberbank , a plan which was backed by the german government .
paying back emergency german loans meanwhile , gm also said it has paid back 200 million euros -lrb- $ 300 million -rrb- of a bridging loan provided by germany to keep opel running , and that it would reimburse the remaining amount before the end of the month .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's government pushed hard for opel 's sale to magna to save the german plants the government had granted a loan of 1.5 billion euros to tide opel over , and was set to make another three billion euros available as loan guarantees if the deal had gone through .
" we now have an outstanding balance of 600 million euros , " gm europe finance director enrico digirolamo said in a separate statement .
on tuesday , german chancellor angela merkel once again insisted that berlin wanted its money back after gm chose to keep opel , a decision merkel said she " regretted enormously . "
gm was now expected to quickly submit a plan detailing how it aims to get opel back on its feet .
gm chief executive fritz henderson has said the group would need around three billion euros in financing to restructure opel , but also suggested recently that gm might have other means to fund the operation .
no guarantees on german jobs german authorities had pushed hard for opel 's sale to magna and sberbank because of assurances that no german plants would subsequently be shut down , something that gm has not guaranteed .
henderson and reilly toured opel headquarters in the town of ruesselsheim near frankfurt on tuesday and met with the head of the workers ' council , klaus franz .
no details have been released of the outcome of those talks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reilly was previously credited with turning around daewoo " as we announced last tuesday , opel / vauxhall will remain a fully integrated member of the new gm family , a decision that is in the best interests of opel / vauxhall , its customers , employees , other stakeholders and gm , " one of the statements quoted henderson as saying .
" with his deep experience with the opel and vauxhall brands , nick is well suited to lead this transition and to work toward the earliest possible normalization of the business . "
the briton is credited with helping turn around operations at the daewoo brand in south korea in the past. rb / afp / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

general motors announced last week that opel would have to shed roughly 10,000 jobs to remain profitable , and now ceo henderson has to try to sell this plan to the staff council at opel 's german base of ruesselsheim .
" today , he shall hold talks with management and with the staff council " , said an opel spokeswoman .
henderson 's meeting with staff council head klaus franz may not be amicable .
in his previous role as opel ceo , henderson became renowned among workers for his tough job-cutting measures .
now , history is poised to repeat itself .
this is the second and final day of henderson 's trip to ruesselsheim .
on monday he met with opel leaders to discuss the company 's future .
an opel spokesman said the ceo is holding internal talks at the opel headquarters , in a bid to gain some insight into the current situation there .
out with the new due to the improving economic climate , general motors recently decided to cancel the proposed sale of opel to canadian car-parts maker magna .
this has angered the german government and local opel unions , because magna had promised to protect all five opel factories based in germany .
other opel employees throughout europe , however , have welcomed general motors ' decision .
bildunterschrift : gm 's decision to keep opel sparked protests according to the german business daily handelsblatt , the opel works council has written to the european union competition commissioner , neelie kroes , asking her to stop any job-cutting measures that are too hard on germany .
however , it was kroes who deemed the pro-german magna stance as anticompetitive , opening the door for general motors to cancel the sale of a majority stake in opel .
opel 's german staff council estimates that roughly 8,000 german employees will lose their jobs at opel under gm 's rule , with a further 2,500 places in belgium at risk .
opel factories in antwerp , belgium , and bochum and eisenach , in germany , are considered the most at risk of closure during the restructuring of opel .
a freer hand ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carl-peter forster quit as opel boss after gm 's u-turn the works council is also lobbying for gm to give opel greater independence in its daily running , a wish the us parent company is likely to grant .
the top short-term priority , however , is seeking out opel 's next ceo to steer the company through its restructuring process .
gm europe boss carl-peter forster , a keen backer of the magna takeover bid , stepped down after gm 's decision to keep the company .
he is now being linked with the budget indian carmaker tata .
meanwhile , henderson was to give a press conference later tuesday , elaborating on gm 's future plans for its european subsidiary .
this could be a critical moment for gm , which still hopes for state support to help fund the opel restructuring .
the german government had already pledged to help magna in its efforts , but after gm thwarted german chancellor angela merkel 's proposed solution , berlin might be unwilling to step in and help this time. msh / dpa / afp / ap editor : jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

failure could result in punitive measures from brussels . tuesday 's meeting of eu finance ministers in brussels was expected to focus on ways and means of cutting national budget deficits without jeopardizing a fragile economic recovery in parts of the bloc .
the eu 's 27 member states also planned on coordinating exits from crisis-related emergency measures in order to avoid distortion of competition .
the meeting came a day before the european commission was set to unveil how much time would be given to individual member states to comply with eu budget deficit rules .
most eu members states are expected to post budget deficits this year that are well in excess of the three percent of gross domestic product stipulated by the bloc 's stability and growth pact .
the commission , which is the eu 's budgetary watchdog , is expected to give germany a 2013 deadline to push its budget deficit below the three percent threshold . " reducing the deficits between 2011 and 2013 corresponds exactly to our ideas , " german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble said on arrival for tuesday 's meeting in brussels .
according to german chancellor angela merkel , germany will see a budget deficit of 3.5 percent this year and about 5 percent in 2010 , accompanied by rising unemployment .
but merkel 's government is confident that tax cuts over the next four years will trigger sufficient growth in europe 's largest economy , enabling berlin to rein in the budget deficit in due time .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble is convinced that germany will be back on its feet by 2013 german optimism fails to impress however , not all eu states share berlin 's optimism , and french diplomats were quoted as saying that it would be " very difficult " for paris to meet a 2013 deadline .
france is anticipating an 8.5 percent budget deficit in 2010 and is aiming at reducing this to 5 percent by 2013 – a move which french budget minister eric woerth described as already constituting a " considerable effort . "
and there are other member states who will have even greater difficulties in regaining control over their finances .
greece 's budget deficit is estimated at around 12 percent of its gdp , while ireland 's is pushing 15 percent .
brussels is entitled to slap heavy fines on eu member states that flout the growth and stability pact . however , in the current economic situation such measures could prove counterproductive .
the commission has voiced concern over eu members ' continued fiscal stimuli that have been passed freely since the beginning of the financial and subsequent economic crisis in 2008/2009 .
in a bid to assuage those concerns , eu finance ministers have already agreed in principle to axe the costly fiscal stimuli in 2011 .
however , this is based on the assumption that economic growth reaches sustainable levels by then .
last week , the commission published new forecasts reinforcing the view that europe will emerge from recession in 2010 and that economic growth will be consolidated in 2011. nk / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pregnancy-related complications and heart disease are also major culprits . hiv / aids claims the lives of more women between the ages of 15 and 44 than any other disease . these findings were published monday as part of the world health organization 's -lrb- who -rrb- first-ever global study of women 's health .
the goal of the study was to ascertain where disparities in medical care between men and women and over a woman 's lifetime continue to persist .
according to the 91-page report , " women who do not know how to protect themselves from such infections , or who are unable to do so , face increased risk of death or illness . "
in developing countries , up to one in five women die of hiv / aids , with unsafe sex being the highest risk factor .
pregnancy-related complications were also among the primary causes of death , killing around 500,000 women per year ; 99 percent of them are in developing countries .
for women over child-bearing age , the most common causes of death are heart disease and stroke .
overall , heart disease is the number one killer of women of all ages and is responsible for about 12 percent of female deaths .

yet again , the japanese government moved to stem the economic downswing with extensive fiscal packages .
as a result public debt will soon hit 200 % of gdp .
and without swingeing reforms , general government debt in japan will soar past the 300 % mark farther down the line .
at the same time , japan ’ s demographics mean that the number of people able to shoulder the burden of debt is decreasing .
in the coming years japan is therefore in danger of slipping into serious fiscal difficulties . emerging asia 's middle class - a force to be reckoned with over the past months hopes have been rising that the asian consumer will replace the us as " world consumer of last resort " .

this month : german industry : recovery on its way but capacity utilisation still low ! at mid-year the german economy put the worst recession since world war ii behind it and returned to slight growth .
nonetheless , the dimension of our growth forecast for manufacturing industry for 2010 -lrb- + 5 % -rrb- should not be overrated .
the level of capacity utilisation in the industry is very low at around 70 % .
such growth in production , though strong , will only take a little of the strain off companies that have been hit particularly hard .
in so far , the upswing is deceiving . economic outlook 2009/10 : german economy - recession ended the signs of recovery in the global economy and germany have become clearer .
in spring , the german economy registered growth for the first time in five quarters after a severe slump in the winter half .
but even if the recovery continues in the second half of the year – as we expect – german gdp will still be down by around 5 % on the year in 2009 .
demand for exports is likely to pick up only gradually in 2010 , with investment continuing to suffer from the plunge in capacity utilisation .
besides , government funding for short-time work and the car scrappage scheme have kept adjustments in the labour market and consumption to a minimum to date .
thus , gdp will probably grow by only slightly more than 1 % in 2010 .
the ecb is expected to unwind its expansionary policy in the course of 2010 , and inflation is likely to stay below 1 % in 2010 . prosperity through trade - germany 's wholesale and foreign trade in times of globalisation foreign trade is the engine that drives economic prosperity in germany .
but in 2009 the global economic crisis has caused the export locomotive to shift into reverse .
in the medium term , however , the outlook for the export industry is good in an increasingly multipolar world .
provided that government puts down the right policy markers , germany can continue to be a globalisation winner .

dna tests have found 35 pure-bred siamese crocodiles at a wildlife sanctuary in cambodia .
there are fewer then 250 of the species left in the wild , but the crocodiles at the sanctuary could now form the basis of a captive-breeding programme .
siamese crocodiles may be smaller than some other species , but they 're easily capable of breaking human limbs .
so for the conservationists at the phnom tamao wildlife rescue centre , taking dna samples was a hazardous task .
in february this year , they wrangled and wrestled 69 of the beasts so they could gather genetic information .
and now it turns out all the hard work was worth it .
thirty-five crocodiles have been confirmed as pure-bred siamese - including six adults which may be suitable for starting off a captive breeding programme .
and more than two dozen younger crocs may be released into the wild when they are old enough .
the discovery continues a remarkable comeback for the species .
siamese crocodiles were declared extinct in the 1990s - before a small population was discovered in cambodia 's cardamom mountains .
but the conservation organisation fauna and flora international has warned that any celebrations would be premature .
siamese crocodiles mature slowly .
so it will take 15 years before the breeding programme comes to fruition .
and in the meantime , everything from poaching to hydroelectric projects pose a threat to crocodiles and their habitats .

dna tests have found 35 pure-bred siamese crocodiles at a wildlife sanctuary in cambodia .
there are fewer then 250 of the species left in the wild , but the crocodiles at the sanctuary could now form the basis of a captive-breeding programme .
siamese crocodiles may be smaller than some other species , but they 're easily capable of breaking human limbs .
so for the conservationists at the phnom tamao wildlife rescue centre , taking dna samples was a hazardous task .
in february this year , they wrangled and wrestled 69 of the beasts so they could gather genetic information .
and now it turns out all the hard work was worth it .
thirty-five crocodiles have been confirmed as pure-bred siamese - including six adults which may be suitable for starting off a captive breeding programme .
and more than two dozen younger crocs may be released into the wild when they are old enough .
the discovery continues a remarkable comeback for the species .
siamese crocodiles were declared extinct in the 1990s - before a small population was discovered in cambodia 's cardamom mountains .
but the conservation organisation fauna and flora international has warned that any celebrations would be premature .
siamese crocodiles mature slowly .
so it will take 15 years before the breeding programme comes to fruition .
and in the meantime , everything from poaching to hydroelectric projects pose a threat to crocodiles and their habitats .

in some areas , a quarter of all households are not claiming insulation benefits they are entitled to .
families could save more than £ 250 a year by installing insulation , the research for home heat helpline found .
four of the top five areas that are taking least advantage of the grants are in wales , according to the study .
it showed households could save about £ 150-a-year on their heating bills by insulating their lofts and save another £ 115-a-year with cavity wall insulation .
the missing millions research , carried out by independent think tank the new policy institute -lrb- npi -rrb- , highlights low income households claiming either out-of-work or disability benefits , working tax credit or pension credit , who could also benefit from insulation grants .
anyone aged over 70 can also apply for a free home insulation grant .
this accounts for a further 1.3m households eligible purely because of their age .
top ten areas that miss out 1 .
blaenau gwent , 26 % of homes 2 .

" this research shows the huge scale of unclaimed help that 's out there on offer from energy suppliers , " said a home heat helpline spokeswoman .
" we have trained advisers who can help you get grants for insulation , special reduced tariffs as well as advice and support on how to keep warm and save money on your bills . "
tony herbert , utilities policy officer at the citizens advice , said there had been an increase in fuel poverty and that it is vital for households to take advantage of the help available .
" with the recession continuing and fuel prices remaining at historically high levels , it is essential that people who are struggling with fuel bills take advantage of the help that is available before the cold weather kicks in , " he said .
" the home heat helpline is free and contacting them could make all the difference in helping you to have a warmer winter . "

like other forces , derbyshire has to pay for damage caused during raids .
" i know that by the end of this financial year with boarding up , with removal and storage of exhibits my budget is going to be overspent by £ 50,000 , " he told file on 4 .
" it gets to the stage where you have to start saying to yourself , ' unless we reduce these costs ... we might have to think twice around which warrants we do and which ones we do n't . " '
he added : " i 've go to find some way of funding it and i ca n't keep going over budget . "
force under pressure ch supt hough 's problem arises because derbyshire police says it has been short-changed by the government 's funding formula .
millions of pounds down on what it claims it should receive , the force is having to rob one budget to fund another .
a special squad of 12 officers , called operation redshank was set up to tackle armed drugs gangs in derby but is frequently redeployed for other major incidents such as a recent murder in cromford .

listen on iplayer download the podcast " it leaves us very stretched especially when there is a major incident , most of the office gets taken onto those duties leaving no staff for day to day intelligence gathering , " det con phil insley told file on 4 .
when redshank could not tackle all the drug dealing which funds the gangs , ch supt hough put together a local drugs squad to take up the slack but this had to be supplemented by officers who would usually be on other duties such as neighbourhood policing .
chief constable mick creedon and his senior staff say they are constantly having to juggle resources and it is putting a big strain on the force .
" until recently our domestic violence staff were working at three times the national recommended workload , " said mr creedon , adding that it was hard to find the resources to cope with cyber investigations needed for high-tech crime or tracking paedophiles .
the chief constable has no doubt that the government 's funding formula is the main reason for his force 's financial problems .
derbyshire should have £ 5m more a year in its coffers .
" we 're now into the fifth year of the funding formula and where we used to lose about £ 6-6.5m a year , we 're now losing between £ 4-5m a year . "
he blames the delay in implementing the full funding because other forces would lose out .
postcode policing the funding formula for the 43 police forces in england and wales was revised five years ago and it is based on a series of complex calculations which tries to match needs with resources but some analysts say it is a difficult balancing act especially as the net result creates winners and losers among the forces . "
policing should not be a postcode lottery " julie spence -lrb- right -rrb- , chief constable cambridgeshire police julie spence , the chief constable of cambridgeshire police told file on 4 the formula has failed to keep pace with demographic changes in places such as her county , which has seen a huge influx of eastern european workers since the enlargement of the european union .
" all i am asking for is an equitable share because it is not right for the people of cambridgeshire that they should be getting a lesser service than the forces we are being compared with .
" wherever you are in the country there is an expectation that there should be a similar level of policing - it should not be a postcode lottery , " she said .
the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- says up to 16 forces are struggling because of the funding formula .
looming cuts policing minister david hanson conceded : " the formula has had its critics , we 've agreed to review it .
" in the next 12 months people will have an opportunity to make their comments and we 've committed for funding now at record levels right through to 2011 . "
but he added : " i have to say to chief constables this is the deal at the moment , there may be challenges and difficulties within it , but this is the deal . "
meanwhile chief constables are bracing themselves for bigger challenges with cuts in the next spending round .
acpo 's president sir hugh orde told file on 4 : " i can confidently predict cuts in police budgets of 10 to 20 % over the next few years . "
mergers plea he believes forces could be more efficient by amalgamating tasks across areas and ultimately by reducing the number of forces across england and wales .
but the funding formula is an obstacle , according to sir hugh : " some forces are better funded than others so if you are looking at an amalgamation between a rich force and a less rich force all sorts of politics predictably play in that world . "
he said firm central leadership is needed to iron out such issues but he added : " i do not detect any political will to deliver this in the foreseeable future . "
david hanson says a new white paper will float the idea of amalgamations but they would be voluntary rather than the compulsory plans the government proposed three years ago .
our political will is to allow local people to determine what they want to do because the political difficulty we had three years ago was that there was centralisation and local people kicked against it . "

policing should not be a postcode lottery julie spence -lrb- right -rrb- , chief constable cambridgeshire police julie spence , the chief constable of cambridgeshire police told file on 4 the formula has failed to keep pace with demographic changes in places such as her county , which has seen a huge influx of eastern european workers since the enlargement of the european union .
" all i am asking for is an equitable share because it is not right for the people of cambridgeshire that they should be getting a lesser service than the forces we are being compared with .
" wherever you are in the country there is an expectation that there should be a similar level of policing - it should not be a postcode lottery , " she said .
the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- says up to 16 forces are struggling because of the funding formula .
looming cuts policing minister david hanson conceded : " the formula has had its critics , we 've agreed to review it .
" in the next 12 months people will have an opportunity to make their comments and we 've committed for funding now at record levels right through to 2011 . "
derbyshire police have to count the cost of drugs raids but he added : " i have to say to chief constables this is the deal at the moment , there may be challenges and difficulties within it , but this is the deal . "
meanwhile chief constables are bracing themselves for bigger challenges with cuts in the next spending round .
acpo 's president sir hugh orde told file on 4 : " i can confidently predict cuts in police budgets of 10 to 20 % over the next few years . "
mergers plea he believes forces could be more efficient by amalgamating tasks across areas and ultimately by reducing the number of forces across england and wales .
but the funding formula is an obstacle , according to sir hugh : " some forces are better funded than others so if you are looking at an amalgamation between a rich force and a less rich force all sorts of politics predictably play in that world . "
he said firm central leadership is needed to iron out such issues but he added : " i do not detect any political will to deliver this in the foreseeable future . "
david hanson says a new white paper will float the idea of amalgamations but they would be voluntary rather than the compulsory plans the government proposed three years ago .
our political will is to allow local people to determine what they want to do because the political difficulty we had three years ago was that there was centralisation and local people kicked against it . "
file on 4 is on bbc radio 4 on tuesday , 10 november , at 2000 gmt , repeated sunday , 15 november , at 1700 .

league officials are looking at calling a meeting of all the clubs .

" we 've never had racial abuse before and we 've had two allegations this year .
we 've been getting friction between coaches .
" we 've got a league management meeting -lrb- tuesday -rrb- and we will have a chat about it and see what we 're going to do and where we 're going to go . "
an official 's story one cardiff club 's secretary , who did not want to be identified , said one of his coaches tried to speak to the other team 's coach about some of their tackles .
" the other coach got his hair off and shoved him in the chest for no reason .
" when he was shoved , one of their club 's parents came over rapidly across the pitch shouting ' i 'll knock your effing head off ' .
" not happy saying it once , he came charging up and said it again within full earshot of the kids and the parents .
it should n't have happened . "
" i think -lsb- problems -rsb- are becoming more prevalent this season .
" i 've noticed the atmosphere deteriorate over the last 12 to 18 months .
" some coaches seem to think that winning is all that matters . "

i 've been here since 1982 and we did n't have these problems then , " he said .

" we 've had incidents over the last two years at all the age groups . "
he added : " where possible , the league will take sanctions .
anything that 's proved , individuals will see themselves removed . "
he added that team websites could also be a source of trouble , with coaches making inappropriate comments on them .
" websites are a dangerous tool .
comments can turn up on there which can be objectionable , " he said .
" a lot of it is running down referees or sometimes hyping kids up for the next match in an unacceptable way . "

the faw said : " it 's a wider problem , it 's not just a football issue - it 's a society problem , " he said .
" people seem to think they can sound off to whoever they want to .
we would take a very dim view of that . "
he said referees , particularly , should not have to tolerate abuse and the faw would always strive to protect them .
arthur smith , general secretary of the referees ' association , said : " i do n't think it 's any worse than it has been over the years .
it 's one of those problems we have where parents tend to think they 've got the boots on , not the children .
" unfortunately we lose a lot of young referees because of the abuse they get from parents on the touchlines . "
sandra hiller , parentline plus spokesperson , said the issue was a " concern " .
" if children see problems solved with raised voices or fists , they learn to follow suit , " she said .
" if you want to stop a child being violent , you may first have to address what is happening around them . "

keith towler said recent child death cases highlighted the role of health providers in identifying child injury .
he pointed to recent reports by watchdog groups which he said identified inconsistencies in practice .
in response , the welsh assembly government said the wellbeing and rights of the young was a top priority .
last month a restructure saw seven nhs health boards take control of all hospitals and community services .
in his second annual report , mr towler said he was concerned about the ability of the newly- enlarged local health boards to undertake their role on local safeguarding childrens ' boards , the organisations which co-ordinate child protection . "
we must ensure that current spending decisions do not undermine early intervention and prevention work " yvonne rodgers , barnardo 's cymru local safeguarding children boards were set up in 2006 to coordinate the work of all those involved in child protection .
they include social services , health professionals and police .
mr towler said their success depended on the ability of those involved to work effectively with each other .
last month , care and social services inspectorate wales -lrb- cssiw -rrb- and healthcare inspectorate wales -lrb- hiw -rrb- said the number of serious case reviews involving children in wales had doubled .
they found 17 cases reviewed in 2007 , and 34 in april 2008 .
there are currently more than 50 serious case reviews ongoing or pending in wales but the cssiw found the current arrangements " are not working effectively . "
the cssiw also found many of the local children safeguarding boards were " not effectively discharging their functions " while " some agencies , by their non participation , were failing in their duty to co-operate " .
mr towler said he was " particularly concerned " by the findings of the hiw report into the arrangements in the health service in wales .
the hiw found nhs staff were " generally alert to child protection issues " but that " some staff working in adult services still appear to not accept that they also have a role in child protection " .
it also raised concern that " not all staff working in the nhs have been criminal record bureau -lrb- crb -rrb- checked and that there are inconsistencies in the way crb checks are undertaken across nhs wales " .
mr towler said he challenged wales ' public health services to demonstrate their robustness and effectiveness in working together to protect children .
he said the assembly government needed to have clear strategy to ensure children are effectively safeguarded .
financial climate he also said current financial climate should not be used as an excuse by local authorities to backtrack on delivering services to children and young people .
barnardo 's cymru director yvonne rodgers said : " we must ensure that current spending decisions do not undermine early intervention and prevention work , otherwise in five years the legacy of the current financial climate will be even more children and young people at risk and experiencing poor outcomes . "
the welsh local government association said improving services for children and young people remains a top priority for every local authority in wales .
the assembly government said it would consider the report 's findings and respond in due course in line with the timescales agreed .

keith towler said recent child death cases highlighted the role of health providers in identifying child injury .
he pointed to recent reports by watchdog groups which he said identified inconsistencies in practice .
in response , the welsh assembly government said the wellbeing and rights of the young was a top priority .
last month a restructure saw seven nhs health boards take control of all hospitals and community services .
in his second annual report , mr towler said he was concerned about the ability of the newly- enlarged local health boards to undertake their role on local safeguarding childrens ' boards , the organisations which co-ordinate child protection .
we must ensure that current spending decisions do not undermine early intervention and prevention work yvonne rodgers , barnardo 's cymru local safeguarding children boards were set up in 2006 to coordinate the work of all those involved in child protection .
they include social services , health professionals and police .
mr towler said their success depended on the ability of those involved to work effectively with each other .
last month , care and social services inspectorate wales -lrb- cssiw -rrb- and healthcare inspectorate wales -lrb- hiw -rrb- said the number of serious case reviews involving children in wales had doubled .
they found 17 cases reviewed in 2007 , and 34 in april 2008 .
there are currently more than 50 serious case reviews ongoing or pending in wales but the cssiw found the current arrangements " are not working effectively . "
the cssiw also found many of the local children safeguarding boards were " not effectively discharging their functions " while " some agencies , by their non participation , were failing in their duty to co-operate " .
mr towler said he was " particularly concerned " by the findings of the hiw report into the arrangements in the health service in wales .
the hiw found nhs staff were " generally alert to child protection issues " but that " some staff working in adult services still appear to not accept that they also have a role in child protection " .
reports after the baby peter case found failings in wales ' child protection it also raised concern that " not all staff working in the nhs have been criminal record bureau -lrb- crb -rrb- checked and that there are inconsistencies in the way crb checks are undertaken across nhs wales " .
mr towler said he challenged wales ' public health services to demonstrate their robustness and effectiveness in working together to protect children .
he said the assembly government needed to have clear strategy to ensure children are effectively safeguarded .
financial climate he also said current financial climate should not be used as an excuse by local authorities to backtrack on delivering services to children and young people .
barnardo 's cymru director yvonne rodgers said : " we must ensure that current spending decisions do not undermine early intervention and prevention work , otherwise in five years the legacy of the current financial climate will be even more children and young people at risk and experiencing poor outcomes . "
the welsh local government association said improving services for children and young people remains a top priority for every local authority in wales .
the assembly government said it would consider the report 's findings and respond in due course in line with the timescales agreed .

financial climate he also said current financial climate should not be used as an excuse by local authorities to backtrack on delivering services to children and young people .
barnardo 's cymru director yvonne rodgers said : " we must ensure that current spending decisions do not undermine early intervention and prevention work , otherwise in five years the legacy of the current financial climate will be even more children and young people at risk and experiencing poor outcomes . "
the welsh local government association said improving services for children and young people remains a top priority for every local authority in wales .
the assembly government said it would consider the report 's findings and respond in due course in line with the timescales agreed .

bbc - cornwall - ben howard returns to cornwall / bbc introducing bbc local -pipe- cornwall -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 07:54 gmt , tuesday , 10 november 2009 ben howard returns to cornwall singer songwriter ben howard will be playing his first headline show in cornwall in december .
the show which will take place in truro on saturday 5 december at basement venue ; the powder room .
howard 's live acoustic show is well developed after recent support slots for xavier rudd and jason mraz .
ben first came into the music spotlight after winning the red stripe music award for unsigned bands .
the award success is not bad for a performer who in december 2008 , left a degree course to concentrate wholly on his music .
to win , ben was picked from more than 150 bands that had been playing around the uk since january 09 .
ben 's music is described as a " blend of percussive folk and raw acoustics that are fitting acknowledgements of his roots : both scenic and musical " .
howard draws inspiration from the likes of john martyn , joni mitchell and modern artists such as ray lamontagne .
ben has had an eventful year emerging early in 2009 to play a handful of cornish shows , which through word of mouth put ben in the sights of local promoters sw1 .
the local music organisation then got ben out on the road with a series of support slots .
howard 's first gigs had him paired with brett dennen in april 2009 .
speaking about her first contact with ben 's shows , katy thomas from sw1 productions said : " it was pretty obvious from that first brett dennen gig that ben was hugely talented , when the headliners stop and listen to the whole of the openers set , you know you have something special . "
following the initial shows ben then started to book a series of festival performances which include a slot on the main stage at the boardmasters and gold coast festivals .
following his shows at these festivals ben was then given the chance to perform a series of support shows for the hugely successful jason mraz on his us tour .
now with a series of international shows under his belt and the red stripe music award victory , ben has released his debut ep , ' these waters ' which should give him plenty of experience for his first series of headline shows .
speaking about the unsigned band award he received in may 2009 ben said : " what has amazed me is that they usually go for bands , but here i am just with my acoustic guitar , i did n't expected it at all .
i went up -lrb- to london -rrb- with the drummer and a few friends from cornwall and it was a real treat to win , i did n't expect it at all . "

following his shows at these festivals ben was then given the chance to perform a series of support shows for the hugely successful jason mraz on his us tour .
performing at the boardmasters festival in newquay now with a series of international shows under his belt and the red stripe music award victory , ben has released his debut ep , ' these waters ' which should give him plenty of experience for his first series of headline shows .
speaking about the unsigned band award he received in may 2009 ben said : " what has amazed me is that they usually go for bands , but here i am just with my acoustic guitar , i did n't expected it at all .
i went up -lrb- to london -rrb- with the drummer and a few friends from cornwall and it was a real treat to win , i did n't expect it at all . "
you can see ben performing at the powder room in truro -lrb- below the wig & pen -rrb- on saturday 5 december 2009 .
