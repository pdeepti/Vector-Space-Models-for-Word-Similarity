program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.08.2009 rasmussen faces afghan challenge as he takes nato helm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen called for more international help from the un and eu to secure and rebuild afghanistan nato welcomed denmark 's former prime minister anders fogh rasmussen on his first day in the organization 's top job .
he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "
across afghanistan , nato troops are trying to ensure a safe setting for the upcoming elections .
the taliban have called upon afghans to boycott the polls and instead take up arms against the western troops .
over the weekend isaf troops once again suffered heavy casualties .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .

german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "

" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .

"
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "

the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .

" these figures are disappointing given that the consumer sentiment indicated that retail might be stabilizing , " simon juncker , an economic researcher at commerzbank , told deutsche welle . the surprise deterioration bucks a recent run of positive reports on the economy .
the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .
" we expect to see deterioration there , and this will of course hit the retail sector as well . " sje / reuters / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .

" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .

its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.08.2009 50 percent fewer illegal african emigrants reaching europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight seen less often in the mediterranean this year an agreement between italy and libya to stem illegal immigration appears to be working .
the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .

" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .

" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .

he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.08.2009 rasmussen faces afghan challenge as he takes nato helm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen called for more international help from the un and eu to secure and rebuild afghanistan nato welcomed denmark 's former prime minister anders fogh rasmussen on his first day in the organization 's top job .
he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

prior to the announcement , economists polled by reuters news agency predicted sales would rise by 0.5 percent . " these figures are disappointing given that the consumer sentiment indicated that retail might be stabilizing , " simon juncker , an economic researcher at commerzbank , told deutsche welle . the surprise deterioration bucks a recent run of positive reports on the economy .
the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .
" we expect to see deterioration there , and this will of course hit the retail sector as well . " sje / reuters / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan .

industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "
across afghanistan , nato troops are trying to ensure a safe setting for the upcoming elections .
the taliban have called upon afghans to boycott the polls and instead take up arms against the western troops .
over the weekend isaf troops once again suffered heavy casualties .
at least nine foreign soldiers were killed in the first two days of august. ai / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .

thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .
it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .
schaeuble is currently germany 's interior minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was merkel 's mentor as she made her way to the top of the party heirarchy merkel , who was cdu general secretary at the time and a kohl protégé , described her mentor ’ s involvement in the scandal as a tragedy for the cdu . she said in unequivocal terms that kohl , who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , could never again be the christian democrats ’ candidate for chancellor . merkel was elected head of the party in 2000 , largely owing to the fact that she was one of the first in the cdu to break with kohl over the scandal . charges politically motivated ? speaking to reporters on sunday , schreiber said there was a political dimension to his extradition , with a general election less than two months away .
" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election . " opinion polls put the christian democrats – currently the dominant party in germany 's governing grand coalition – well ahead of the social democrats , led by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . controversial arms deals schreiber is also wanted by prosecutors in augsburg for tax evasion , bribery and fraud . the former arms lobbyist stands accused of evading taxes on millions of euros in income from weapons deals as well as offering bribes to ensure government approval for the sale of armored cars to saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will also be investigating schreiber 's arms deals schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 on a german warrant .
after a 10-year court battle , a court in ontario on sunday finally approved his extradition to germany . " over a 10-year period , mr. schreiber was given every reasonable opportunity to challenge his extradition , " canadian justice minister rob nicholson said .
" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.08.2009 rasmussen faces afghan challenge as he takes nato helm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen called for more international help from the un and eu to secure and rebuild afghanistan nato welcomed denmark 's former prime minister anders fogh rasmussen on his first day in the organization 's top job .
he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.08.2009 opinion : little hope left for fair resolution of post-election turmoil in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass trial of post-election protestors and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's confirmation of president ahmadinejad 's re-election both underscore the disconnect of those in power in iran , says peter philipp . anyone who was expecting or at least hoping that the officially announced results of the iranian presidential elections might be reversed has now definitively been shown to be wrong .
the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .
it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .
schaeuble is currently germany 's interior minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was merkel 's mentor as she made her way to the top of the party heirarchy merkel , who was cdu general secretary at the time and a kohl protégé , described her mentor ’ s involvement in the scandal as a tragedy for the cdu . she said in unequivocal terms that kohl , who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , could never again be the christian democrats ’ candidate for chancellor . merkel was elected head of the party in 2000 , largely owing to the fact that she was one of the first in the cdu to break with kohl over the scandal . charges politically motivated ? speaking to reporters on sunday , schreiber said there was a political dimension to his extradition , with a general election less than two months away .
" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election . " opinion polls put the christian democrats – currently the dominant party in germany 's governing grand coalition – well ahead of the social democrats , led by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . controversial arms deals schreiber is also wanted by prosecutors in augsburg for tax evasion , bribery and fraud . the former arms lobbyist stands accused of evading taxes on millions of euros in income from weapons deals as well as offering bribes to ensure government approval for the sale of armored cars to saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will also be investigating schreiber 's arms deals schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 on a german warrant .
after a 10-year court battle , a court in ontario on sunday finally approved his extradition to germany . " over a 10-year period , mr. schreiber was given every reasonable opportunity to challenge his extradition , " canadian justice minister rob nicholson said .
" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development .

industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .

" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .

it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .

" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election . " opinion polls put the christian democrats – currently the dominant party in germany 's governing grand coalition – well ahead of the social democrats , led by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . controversial arms deals schreiber is also wanted by prosecutors in augsburg for tax evasion , bribery and fraud . the former arms lobbyist stands accused of evading taxes on millions of euros in income from weapons deals as well as offering bribes to ensure government approval for the sale of armored cars to saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will also be investigating schreiber 's arms deals schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 on a german warrant .
after a 10-year court battle , a court in ontario on sunday finally approved his extradition to germany . " over a 10-year period , mr. schreiber was given every reasonable opportunity to challenge his extradition , " canadian justice minister rob nicholson said .
" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .

berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .

many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "
across afghanistan , nato troops are trying to ensure a safe setting for the upcoming elections .
the taliban have called upon afghans to boycott the polls and instead take up arms against the western troops .
over the weekend isaf troops once again suffered heavy casualties .
at least nine foreign soldiers were killed in the first two days of august. ai / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .

" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .

i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 03.08.2009 taliban return to kunduz after german military offensive großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german and afghan troops try to stabilize kunduz ahead of elections afghan officials say taliban fighters have returned to the northern province of kunduz .
this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "
across afghanistan , nato troops are trying to ensure a safe setting for the upcoming elections .
the taliban have called upon afghans to boycott the polls and instead take up arms against the western troops .
over the weekend isaf troops once again suffered heavy casualties .
at least nine foreign soldiers were killed in the first two days of august. ai / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .

what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.08.2009 weak german retail sales dampen economic optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german retail sales for june declined by 1.8 percent month-on-month german retail sales dropped by 1.8 percent in june , denting hopes that a surge in consumer spending would help europe 's largest economy quickly climb out of recession . the provisional data published by the federal statistics office on monday fell far short of analysts ' expectations for the retail sector .
prior to the announcement , economists polled by reuters news agency predicted sales would rise by 0.5 percent . " these figures are disappointing given that the consumer sentiment indicated that retail might be stabilizing , " simon juncker , an economic researcher at commerzbank , told deutsche welle . the surprise deterioration bucks a recent run of positive reports on the economy .
the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .
" we expect to see deterioration there , and this will of course hit the retail sector as well . " sje / reuters / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development .

the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .

" last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

prior to the announcement , economists polled by reuters news agency predicted sales would rise by 0.5 percent . " these figures are disappointing given that the consumer sentiment indicated that retail might be stabilizing , " simon juncker , an economic researcher at commerzbank , told deutsche welle . the surprise deterioration bucks a recent run of positive reports on the economy .
the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .
" we expect to see deterioration there , and this will of course hit the retail sector as well . " sje / reuters / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical music -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .

a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

shortly afterwards the release was confirmed by the german government . " i have learned with great relief that the crew of the hansa stavanger has been freed , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in a statement , which added that the crew members were well . german chancellor angela merkel expressed " relief and joy " that the ship and its crew had been released , a government spokeswoman said in berlin . media reports said a plane had dropped a package containing the ransom of $ 2.7 million over the seized ship . the amount was confirmed by the the pirate gang responsible for the seizure . " we have received $ 2.7 million from the owners , " muse guled told the dpa press agency by phone from haradhere . the german-flagged container vessel , owned by hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg , was captured about 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km , 460 miles -rrb- off the southern somali port of kismayu on april 4 . the ship 's crew includes five germans , three russians , two ukrainians , two filipinos and 12 tuvaluans . worsening situation german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last week that the situation on board the ship had dramatically worsened .
there was a lack of fresh water , food and medicines , the magazine said , adding that several hostages had been taken to the somali mainland . the german government is reported to have orginally planned to free the ship with its elite commando gsg-9 police force .

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.08.2009 opinion : little hope left for fair resolution of post-election turmoil in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass trial of post-election protestors and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's confirmation of president ahmadinejad 's re-election both underscore the disconnect of those in power in iran , says peter philipp . anyone who was expecting or at least hoping that the officially announced results of the iranian presidential elections might be reversed has now definitively been shown to be wrong .
the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .

the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.08.2009 opinion : little hope left for fair resolution of post-election turmoil in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass trial of post-election protestors and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's confirmation of president ahmadinejad 's re-election both underscore the disconnect of those in power in iran , says peter philipp . anyone who was expecting or at least hoping that the officially announced results of the iranian presidential elections might be reversed has now definitively been shown to be wrong .
the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.08.2009 50 percent fewer illegal african emigrants reaching europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight seen less often in the mediterranean this year an agreement between italy and libya to stem illegal immigration appears to be working .
the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

" last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .

i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.08.2009 opinion : little hope left for fair resolution of post-election turmoil in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass trial of post-election protestors and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's confirmation of president ahmadinejad 's re-election both underscore the disconnect of those in power in iran , says peter philipp . anyone who was expecting or at least hoping that the officially announced results of the iranian presidential elections might be reversed has now definitively been shown to be wrong .
the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .
it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .
schaeuble is currently germany 's interior minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was merkel 's mentor as she made her way to the top of the party heirarchy merkel , who was cdu general secretary at the time and a kohl protégé , described her mentor ’ s involvement in the scandal as a tragedy for the cdu . she said in unequivocal terms that kohl , who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , could never again be the christian democrats ’ candidate for chancellor . merkel was elected head of the party in 2000 , largely owing to the fact that she was one of the first in the cdu to break with kohl over the scandal . charges politically motivated ? speaking to reporters on sunday , schreiber said there was a political dimension to his extradition , with a general election less than two months away .
" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election . " opinion polls put the christian democrats – currently the dominant party in germany 's governing grand coalition – well ahead of the social democrats , led by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . controversial arms deals schreiber is also wanted by prosecutors in augsburg for tax evasion , bribery and fraud . the former arms lobbyist stands accused of evading taxes on millions of euros in income from weapons deals as well as offering bribes to ensure government approval for the sale of armored cars to saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will also be investigating schreiber 's arms deals schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 on a german warrant .
after a 10-year court battle , a court in ontario on sunday finally approved his extradition to germany . " over a 10-year period , mr. schreiber was given every reasonable opportunity to challenge his extradition , " canadian justice minister rob nicholson said .
" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 03.08.2009 opinion : little hope left for fair resolution of post-election turmoil in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mass trial of post-election protestors and supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei 's confirmation of president ahmadinejad 's re-election both underscore the disconnect of those in power in iran , says peter philipp . anyone who was expecting or at least hoping that the officially announced results of the iranian presidential elections might be reversed has now definitively been shown to be wrong .
the incumbent and ostensible winner , mahmoud ahmadinejad , has been confirmed by the supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei .
now there is little doubt that two days from now the parliament will approve the election of the new old president .
from the perspective of those in power , it 's simply logical .
since the day of the vote , they have insisted that everything was handled properly on june 12 and that ahmadinejad , who is controversial both nationally and internationally , won a massive majority on that day .
for the opposition and the disappointed voters , however , the official confirmation that ahmadinejad was rightfully elected is another slap in the face .
weeks of protest have had no impact .
on the contrary , pressure from the government has grown .
demonstrations have been banned and violently broken up .
news coverage of the protests has been suppressed .
and most significantly , thousands of protest organizers and participants have been jailed and hundreds of them have been put on the stand in a mass show trial .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp this too is a well-timed orchestration : as ahmadinejad begins his second term , his opponents are denigrated as insurrectionists , puppets of foreign governments and enemies of the islamic republic .
the only people who believe that are those who want to .
because even the statements that some of the accused have made – most likely under pressure – do n't support these charges , including the implication that opposition candidate mousavi and the two former presidents khatami and rafsanjani joined forces before the election to prevent ahmadinejad 's re-election .
what in a democracy would be described as a political alliance is seen by the tehran revolutionary court as treasonous ; the court claims the three politicians clearly wanted to damage khamenei above all .
given his thus far inviolable position , that is almost sacrilege , or in any case , an act against the regime of the islamic republic .
but when instead of the three politicians , their staff members and demonstration organizers are put on the stand , this shows that those in power do n't feel comfortable with the situation .
they know , just as everyone in the country does , that the recent protests were n't a coup attempt controlled from abroad , but rather the expression of broad dissatisfaction – with the way the elections went but above all with the general conditions in the country .
and they also know that the demonstrations were an external expression of an internal power struggle that remains unresolved .
ex-presidents rafsanjani and khatami , in particular , are calling for more freedom than they were ready or able to provide during their presidencies .
as long as they continue to do so , the opposition will maintain a remnant of hope , but if they too are gagged or brought before court , then the violence could really escalate .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development .

" critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan .

industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .
it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .
schaeuble is currently germany 's interior minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was merkel 's mentor as she made her way to the top of the party heirarchy merkel , who was cdu general secretary at the time and a kohl protégé , described her mentor ’ s involvement in the scandal as a tragedy for the cdu . she said in unequivocal terms that kohl , who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , could never again be the christian democrats ’ candidate for chancellor . merkel was elected head of the party in 2000 , largely owing to the fact that she was one of the first in the cdu to break with kohl over the scandal . charges politically motivated ? speaking to reporters on sunday , schreiber said there was a political dimension to his extradition , with a general election less than two months away .
" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election .

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes a day after the death of six foreign troops and signals a bloody start to the election month . the latest escalation of violence comes as british lawmakers say the afghan mission lacks a realistic strategy .
the nato-led international security force -lrb- isaf -rrb- said the three us soldiers were killed on sunday in eastern afghanistan when their patrol was hit by a roadside bomb and then came under fire from insurgents .
the incident comes a day after six foreign troops died in separate attacks in the country , making it one of the worst weekends for foreign forces .
july saw the highest monthly death toll for foreign troops since the ousting of the taliban in 2001 .
deadly start to election month bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ballot boxes await votes the latest escalation of violence comes ahead of presidential elections scheduled for august 20 in afghanistan .
the taliban have vowed to disrupt the election and have called on afghans to boycott the ballot .
in a report released on august 2 , british lawmakers criticized the military mission in afghanistan , saying it lacked a realistic strategy and was burdened by too many responsibilities including fighting the drugs trade .
" we recommend that in the immediate future the government should refocus its efforts to concentrate its limited resources on one priority , namely security , " lawmakers on the house of commons foreign affairs committee said in a published report .
the report also warned that other nato allies should contribute more to fighting the taliban in afghanistan or risk damaging the alliance 's reputation .
" the failure of some nato allies to ensure that the burden of international effort in afghanistan is shared equitably has placed an unacceptable strain on a handful of countries , " parliament 's foreign affairs committee said in a report .
the report was issued after britain suffered the loss of 22 soldiers killed in july , the deadliest month of the war during which britain and the united states carried out major operations against taliban insurgents in the southern province of helmand .
britain has more than 9,000 troops in afghanistan , the largest foreign contingent after the united states .

but it 's unlikely his case will be heard before polls next month . the 75-year-old , who holds dual canadian and german citizenship , arrived in munich on monday after fighting extradition from canada for 10 years . his arrival in germany could spell trouble for chancellor merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- before next month 's federal elections because it 's expected to dig up past allegations over party slush funds which led to the fall of former chancellor helmut kohl . a spokesman for the court in augsburg , karl-heinz haeusler , said it was not possible to say whether the politically sensitive trial would begin before national elections on september 27 .
" that would be a case of reading tea leaves .
one can only speculate , " haeusler told afp . scandal led to merkel 's rise schreiber is accused of playing a key role in the massive slush fund scandal that rocked the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- in the 1990s .
it also ended the political career of former chancellor helmut kohl and paved the way for current chancellor angela merkel 's rise to power . schreiber , a long-time member of the christian social union , the bavarian sister party of the cdu , is believed to have made an undeclared one million deutschmark -lrb- 500,000 euros -rrb- donation to the cdu . the funding scandal forced the resignation of wolfgang schaeuble as cdu chairman in 2000 and kohl was forced to quit as honorary president after admitting accepting illegal party donations .
schaeuble is currently germany 's interior minister . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kohl was merkel 's mentor as she made her way to the top of the party heirarchy merkel , who was cdu general secretary at the time and a kohl protégé , described her mentor ’ s involvement in the scandal as a tragedy for the cdu . she said in unequivocal terms that kohl , who was chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , could never again be the christian democrats ’ candidate for chancellor . merkel was elected head of the party in 2000 , largely owing to the fact that she was one of the first in the cdu to break with kohl over the scandal . charges politically motivated ? speaking to reporters on sunday , schreiber said there was a political dimension to his extradition , with a general election less than two months away .
" the social democrats won three elections with my case in the past , " he said , referring to the junior partner in merkel 's coalition government .
" if i come now that would be the greatest thing , it would start a huge investigation and ... they would think they could win the next election . " opinion polls put the christian democrats – currently the dominant party in germany 's governing grand coalition – well ahead of the social democrats , led by foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier . controversial arms deals schreiber is also wanted by prosecutors in augsburg for tax evasion , bribery and fraud . the former arms lobbyist stands accused of evading taxes on millions of euros in income from weapons deals as well as offering bribes to ensure government approval for the sale of armored cars to saudi arabia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the court will also be investigating schreiber 's arms deals schreiber was arrested in toronto in 1999 on a german warrant .
after a 10-year court battle , a court in ontario on sunday finally approved his extradition to germany . " over a 10-year period , mr. schreiber was given every reasonable opportunity to challenge his extradition , " canadian justice minister rob nicholson said .
" his surrender to germany was in full accord with the law and consistent with the spirit and purpose of extradition . " last year , canada 's government agreed to allow schreiber to stay in canada until he testified at a public inquiry into cash payments he made to former prime minister brian mulroney . that investigation centered on cash payments schreiber made to mulroney as part of a lobbying operation to secure support for building a german light armored vehicle factory in canada . the inquiry held its final hearing in ottawa last tuesday and is expected to issue its report by the end of the year . mulroney has denied any wrongdoing . sp / afp / reuters / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de classical -pipe- 03.08.2009 newly discovered mozart works reveal his musical development großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mozart wrote more than 600 pieces of music before his death in 1791 at the age of 35 two works for piano have recently been identified as those of the child prodigy wolfgang amadeus mozart .
written before his tenth birthday , they give insight into his development as a composer . click on the links below to hear the two newly discovered mozart pieces .
the international mozarteum foundation in salzburg on sunday presented two works which have only recently been identified as being compositions by the young wolfgang amadeus mozart .
the pieces , a movement of a keyboard concerto and a prelude for keyboard , were performed by florian birsak for the first time for an invited audience on mozart 's own fortepiano in the mozart residence in salzburg .
an orchestral version of the concerto movement has been reconstructed by harvard professor and pianist robert levin , which will be performed for the first time during the annual mozart week festival in salzburg in january 2010 .
works penned by mozart 's father bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the house mozart was born in is now a museum mozart was born into a musical family on jan .
27 , 1756 , at the house getreidegasse no. 9 in salzburg .
father leopold was a violinist and deputy leader of the court orchestra of the prince-archbishop , the ruler of what was at that time the independent principality of salzburg .
leopold mozart greatly encouraged the musical talent of his two children : maria anna , known as " nannerl , " who was five years older than her brother wolfgang .
for nannerl , leopold compiled a collection of pieces intended to help her practice on a keyboard instrument .
it is in " nannerl 's music book " that the two pieces have been identified as early compositions by wolfgang amadeus mozart .
until now , the works , written in leopold mozart 's hand , were considered to be anonymous . ulrich leisinger , musicologist and director of the research department of the international mozarteum foundation , identified the works while planning and preparing a facsimile edition of " nannerl 's music book . "
detective work and musicological analysis while analyzing and evaluating the works in the music book , leisinger noticed that there was a striking discrepancy in the appearance of the manuscript and the musical composition .
by analyzing the handwriting and taking other stylistic criteria into consideration , he concluded that two works were actually composed by the young mozart , who was not competent enough in musical notation , and transcribed by his father while the boy played the works at the keyboard .
" the handwriting makes the impression as if it was a working manuscript , as if leopold was involved as a composer , but the musical style of these two pieces is so extraordinary , " ulrich leisinger told deutsche welle . " the concerto movement has such difficult things like runs in semi-quavers over several pages in a molto allegro ; the hands crossing each other sometimes , almost intermingled in each other and there are heavy and wild jumps in the right hand part which make it a very tricky and almost over-ambitious piece , " he added .
mozart far beyond his years bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this contemporary sketch shows mozart performing at the age of seven it is not possible to date the works precisely , but they are believed to have originated prior to mozart 's tenth birthday - that is , before 1766 .
after that date , no more entries were made in " nannerl 's music book . " the music book came into the collections of the cathedral music association and mozarteum , the forerunner of the international mozarteum foundation , in 1864 .
the foundation fosters mozart 's heritage and owns many of the mozart family 's original letters and autograph manuscripts as well as mozart 's own piano and violin .
after the composer 's death in 1791 , his sister nannerl , who survived him by 38 years , collected anecdotes from people who had known him in salzburg .
the court trumpeter and close friend of the mozart family , johann andreas schachtner , recalled that one day he and leopold came home to find mozart busy writing with ink and quill .
when leopold asked his son what he was doing , young wolfgang replied , " i 'm writing a keyboard concerto . "
when leopold looked at the musical notation which was full of ink blots , he was , according to schachtner , moved to tears when he realized how correctly his son had set everything .
however , he criticized the boy for making the work too difficult for anyone to play .
wolfgang responded by saying : " that 's a concerto movement and you really have to practice hard to play it . "
from simple dances to complicated concertos bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich leisinger presents the two works at the international mozarteum foundation in reconstructing the orchestral part of the piano concert , robert levin said he began by identifying the very first motive that the keyboard plays , since the orchestra always begins with the principle theme , according to classical concerto form .
" you search for a form of the tune which is apt for a stringed instrument and probably a bit simpler , " he said . for musicologists , the value of the works lies in analyzing how mozart developed as a composer and how he managed to make a leap from writing small , dance-like movements with limited dimensions to a much larger scale piece like his first symphony which he composed in london in 1764/65 .
a facsimile edition of the newly identified works has been issued and a cd recording of the orchestral version is also in the works . in autumn 2009 , the complete " nannerl 's music book " will appear in a facsimile edition .

shortly afterwards the release was confirmed by the german government . " i have learned with great relief that the crew of the hansa stavanger has been freed , " said german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier in a statement , which added that the crew members were well . german chancellor angela merkel expressed " relief and joy " that the ship and its crew had been released , a government spokeswoman said in berlin . media reports said a plane had dropped a package containing the ransom of $ 2.7 million over the seized ship . the amount was confirmed by the the pirate gang responsible for the seizure . " we have received $ 2.7 million from the owners , " muse guled told the dpa press agency by phone from haradhere . the german-flagged container vessel , owned by hamburg-based shipping company leonhardt & blumberg , was captured about 400 nautical miles -lrb- 740 km , 460 miles -rrb- off the southern somali port of kismayu on april 4 . the ship 's crew includes five germans , three russians , two ukrainians , two filipinos and 12 tuvaluans . worsening situation german newsmagazine der spiegel reported last week that the situation on board the ship had dramatically worsened .
there was a lack of fresh water , food and medicines , the magazine said , adding that several hostages had been taken to the somali mainland . the german government is reported to have orginally planned to free the ship with its elite commando gsg-9 police force .
but berlin then abandoned the plan because it was considered too risky . the release of the hansa stavanger came hours after the european union said that pirates had released a malaysian tugboat , masindra seven , and its crew of 11 indonesians on sunday after being held captive for seven months . gangs of somali pirates have made millions of dollars in ransom payments by kidnapping ships that sail the shipping lanes linking asia and europe . sp / afp / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're wafer-thin and environmentally friendly and can be made in large quantities for a fraction of the cost of conventional batteries . a group of german scientists want to trim down heavy , bulky batteries to wafers thinner than a millimeter and lighter than a gram .
the research team , led by reinhard baumann of the fraunhofer research institution for electronic nano systems -lrb- enas -rrb- , also wants the new batteries to be produced by a cost-effective printing process . " our goal is to be able to mass produce the batteries at a price in the single digit cent range each , " andreas willert , group manager at enas , said in a statement . by placing several batteries in a row , voltages of 3 v , 4.5 v and 6 v can also be achieved .
the battery contains no mercury and is in this respect environmentally friendly .
its voltage is 1.5 v. a standard aaa battery weighs about 11.5 grams and also runs at 1.5 volts . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : printable batteries would n't completely replace conventional ones the batteries are printed using a silk-screen printing method similar to that used for t-shirts and signs . the printing process presses together layers of a zinc anode and a manganese cathode , as well as other materials .
the zinc and manganese gradually react and produce electricity .
the process makes it possible to apply comparatively large quantities of printing paste , and the individual layers are slightly thicker than a hair . during the chemical process , the elements gradually dissipate , giving the battery a limited lifespan . currently , the battery is most commonly used in musical greeting cards , but researchers have said it could turn up in wide variety of places in the near future , including smart cards that would store security codes for a limited amount of time .
researchers said they hoped to finish other products using the batteries by the end of 2009 . printed batteries are also used to provide power in smart packaging and toys .
they run active rfid tracking chips and are used in medical sensors and cosmetic patches . the industry for thin-film and printed batteries will reach $ 5.6 billion -lrb- 4 billion euros -rrb- by 2015 , according to an april report from analyst group nanomarkets . in addition to research groups like fraunhofer and small and medium-sized companies pursuing the technology , large firms including air products , dow chemical , intel , and nec have also invested in printable batteries , the report said . author : sean sinico editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de nato -pipe- 03.08.2009 rasmussen faces afghan challenge as he takes nato helm großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen called for more international help from the un and eu to secure and rebuild afghanistan nato welcomed denmark 's former prime minister anders fogh rasmussen on his first day in the organization 's top job .
he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he vowed to continue to fight for stability in afghanistan and to renew relations with russia . operations in afghanistan , and relations with russia and the countries bordering the mediterranean , will be nato 's top priorities over the next four years , the alliance 's new secretary general , anders fogh rasmussen , said on monday .
" i want to see nato reach its full potential as a pillar of global security , " rasmussen told journalists at his first press conference in his new role .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nato currently has more than 90,000 soldiers stationed in afghanistan his task over the next four years will be to chair nato meetings and summits , as well as to coordinate debates and decisions among member states . nato 's efforts to stabilize afghanistan by training the country 's security forces to defeat extremists is at the top of the priority list .
" success would be to transfer the responsibility for security to the afghans themselves .
this is the ultimate goal , " rasmussen said .
that will only be achieved if nato stays in the country for the long term , he added .
public support for the afghan mission has fallen sharply in some alliance nations following a surge in casualties over recent months .
" we will support the afghan people for as long as it takes .
let me repeat that , for as long as it takes , " he said .
relations with russia the second priority will be to improve cooperation on security issues with moscow , one year after russian troops marched into georgia , a country with nato aspirations .
rasmussen admitted that there will be areas of fundamental disagreement , but insisted that these must not be allowed to poison the entire relationship .
" i consider it a very important challenge to convince the russian people and leadership that nato is really not an enemy , " he said .
nato froze ties with russia after the war , but re-started formal cooperation in the spring .
both sides remain at odds over issues such as nato enlargement and missile defense .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen will have to try hard to get the muslim world on his side following the cartoon controversy in denmark during his premiership rasmussen is also hoping to improve relations with the countries around the mediterranean and in the middle east , and has already invited the ambassadors of mediterranean states including algeria , egypt , israel , jordan , mauritania , morocco and tunisia to hold one-on-one talks .
rasmussen was denmark 's prime minister in 2005 when a series of cartoons in a copenhagen newspaper showing caricatures of the prophet muhammad outraged muslim public opinion .
" let me assure the governments and people -lrb- in nato partner states along the mediterranean and in the middle east -rrb- that i am fully committed to building stronger relations with them on the basis of mutual respect , understanding and trust , " rasmussen said on his first day in office .
" i will take concrete steps , starting today , to engage with the countries of the mediterranean dialogue ...
i will personally engage in dialogue with all of them to hear their views , " he said .
nato founded its mediterranean dialogue in 1994 in a bid to build closer ties and improve security cooperation around its southern borders .
rasmussen stressed that , for him , the cartoons controversy was " an element of the past , " and said he was looking forward to working with muslim leaders in afghanistan , in particular .
debating nato 's future strategy the alliance 's new secretary general also announced that madeleine albright , the first woman to serve as us secretary of state , is to lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former us secretary of state madeleine albright will lead a group of 12 experts debating nato 's future strategy the last time the north atlantic treaty organization drew up an overall strategy was in 1999 , well before events such as the 2001 terrorist attacks on the us , the toppling of the taliban in afghanistan and the surge in pirate attacks in the gulf of aden , which nato is now engaged in fighting .
albright and her vice-chair , jeroen van der veer , former head of royal dutch shell , will therefore lead a discussion on what probable challenges nato will face over the next decade and how it should respond to them .
their 10 expert colleagues include britain 's former defense minister geoff hoon , turkey 's former ambassador to nato , umit pamir , and the president of the french national library , bruno racine , as well as a number of career diplomats .
nato will also launch an online forum where ordinary citizens can make suggestions , rasmussen said .
the proposals will be passed on to nato member states , with final approval of the new strategy expected at the alliance 's next summit in lisbon in late 2010. mrm / reuters / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a temporary art space in the german town of karlsruhe is helping stop inner-city decay and bringing art directly to the people at the same time . until just a couple of months ago , this was an abandoned shop whose boarded-up windows were covered with graffiti .
now it 's a glossy art space - albeit temporary - located smack-bang in the middle of karlsruhe 's bustling pedestrian zone .
christine geesing had the idea for a temporary art space after a pottery supplier closed up shop .
his lease still ran for three months , and so he offered the store to artists to use for an exhibition .
geesing was taken with the idea of using vacant shops and offices as a temporary space , but wanted to create something permanent - not just for a couple of months .
as a result , together with seven like-minded artists and artisans , she created the kunst transit -lrb- or , " art on the move " -rrb- initiative .
" there are so many artists who would like to do something together , " said geesing .
" and there are so many initiatives but a lot of them die because they are really suffering from lack of room . "
geesing is an artist herself .
one of her works - showing plastic body parts from a doll embedded in a thick bed of white fake fur - is part of the current exhibition , entitled " in the middle of the moment . "
giving artists a chance the idea behind kunst transit is to organize temporary exhibition spaces for artists and designers , both established and unknown .
the initiative puts on a new group exhibition each month , offering a mix of objects with a range of prices - all on a volunteer basis .
according to geesing , it was initially " quite hard " to convince people to provide the rooms rent-free to the initiative ; although kunst transit pays water , gas and electricity , as well as the costs of renovating the space .
" real estate managers could n't see any reason why they should , " she said .
" and house owners - maybe they thought , ' oh , artists , oh no .
maybe they 'll just damage everything . " '
geesing believes , however , it will be easier to find new premises when they have to leave their current space , which has been provided by the german drug store chain dm .
as the initiative becomes more established , people have started to realize what kunst transit can give back to the community , she said .
bildunterschrift : there 's something in every price range contributing to the city " -lrb- we are -rrb- putting a bit of contemporary art spirit into the town and giving this empty space for a moment something like significance , " she said , " something like a five minutes of fame for this room . "
karlsruhe painter maike tersch , who is taking part in this month 's kunst transit exhibition , said it 's " great " that vacant rooms are being used for art .
for her , it 's also important that the project gives artists a chance to exhibit outside of the professional galleries .
" at times , working with galleries really is n't easy , " tersch said .
" in galleries , often the emphasis is on the art and the artist is forgotten .
that can be problematic . "
but kunst transit does n't just benefit the artists but also the general public .
the managing director of the boesner art supplies company , georg schauer , who sponsors the project , said organizing an exhibition in a former store in the main shopping strip makes it easier for people to encounter art .
they " can enter without feeling embarrassed , " he said .
" they are maybe afraid of going to a gallery and here they can have the experience that for a lot of them is affordable and inspiring . "
this month , kunst transit features a new section entitled " small format . "
the section presents single art works from 20 artists .
no work can be larger than 40 by 40 centimeters -lrb- 8 inches by 8 inches -rrb- , and more expensive than 200 euros -lrb- $ 285 -rrb- .
the idea is to allow more artists to exhibit and to make original art affordable for the general public .
" we really hope to encourage people to buy art , " geesing said .

this comes only days after the end of a joint german and afghan offensive to push back taliban influence ahead of afghan elections . " when the operation began , the leaders of the taliban fled to neighboring provinces and other areas .
others simply hid their weapons and blended in with the local population , " said abdul wahid omarkehl , administrative chief in the char darah district in kunduz province .
" now , they have just taken their weapons back out again and those who fled to neighboring provinces have come back after the end of the operation . "
it was the biggest offensive by the german military in afghanistan so far .
around 300 bundeswehr troops , alongside 900 afghan security forces , were seeking to push back taliban-led insurgents in the northern province of kunduz ahead of the country 's presidential elections on august 20 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german military used tanks and heavy artillery in their offensive the char darah district is one of the most unstable parts of northern afghanistan .
german troops there continuously face attacks and ambushes .
nato expects more trouble for kunduz on sunday , stanley mcchrystal , head of the nato isaf troops , said he was very concerned about the development in the previously calm north , warning that the taliban were pushing to expand their strongholds in the south of afghanistan across the entire country .
thomas ruttig is with the afghanistan analysts network and the institute for international and security affairs in berlin .
he told deutsche welle that the crucial part of the bundeswehr mission to remove the taliban from kunduz would not be to force them out , but rather to stop them from returning .
" it 's like a balloon you fill with water .
if you press one part of it , the bubbles come out at some other place , " he said .
" and that 's the modus operandi of the taliban , which on the other hand also shows that neither the afghan nor the international forces are able to control the whole territory of afghanistan , so there are always backdoors open for the taliban . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : incumbent hamid karzai is tipped to win the august 20 presidential election german offensive not in vain but abdul wahid omarkehl says that , despite the taliban 's resurgence , the german-led offensive was not in vain .
" if the military is present and conducts operations like these , then this is a way of forcing the taliban to disperse .
it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .
and that 's why such operations make sense , " he said .
" if there could be another such offensive just ahead of the presidential poll , then we 'd be able to conduct elections properly in the unstable districts . "
across afghanistan , nato troops are trying to ensure a safe setting for the upcoming elections .
the taliban have called upon afghans to boycott the polls and instead take up arms against the western troops .
over the weekend isaf troops once again suffered heavy casualties .
at least nine foreign soldiers were killed in the first two days of august. ai / dpa / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it takes 20 days or even a month until they can regroup and regain strength .

" creating four million new jobs by 2020 is realistic and many economic experts consider the target possible , " steinmeier said in a keynote speech in berlin . " naturally the state is n't going to be creating these new jobs but it can set up the right framework for a sensible economic development . " speaking to reporters , steinmeier said : " these are not just a bunch of dodgy promises . " critics attack plan the foreign minister and deputy chancellor , who 's heading the spd 's ticket in parliamentary elections on september 27 , has been attacked by his political rivals for what they say are unrealistic plans and a headline-grabbing ploy to detract from his floundering campaign . alexander dobrindt , secretary general of the conservative bavarian-only christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , said steinmeier was recreating a planned economy reminiscent of communist east germany with his " 10-year plan . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier , left , is facing off with chancellor merkel in national elections next month dirk niebel , secretary general of the free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- , with which merkel 's cdu hopes to form an alliance , described steinmeier 's promise as “ an act of desperation ” as the spd seeks to regain lost ground just weeks before the election .
industry leaders have also slammed steinmeier 's plans .
wolfgang franz , head of the so-called council of wise men , a government-appointed group of economic experts , told bild newspaper that steinmeier could only create an employment-friendly framework as chancellor , but the jobs themselves could only be created by private industries .
the spd is currently lagging about 10 percentage points behind chancellor angela merkel 's cdu , in opinion polls .
steinmeier sticks to plans but steinmeier on monday insisted that his " germany plan " can create jobs in sectors that reduce energy consumption and save natural resources - along with other green tech areas such as " electro-mobility . "
he said further jobs were possible in the healthcare sector , particularly in the care of the elderly .
" it 's realistic and ambitious - and it 's a way to go beyond all the abstract talk about the economic crisis , " steinmeier said .
steinmeier 's pledge to create four million new jobs comes at a time when economists are predicting that the global economic downturn will push the number of jobless in germany to four million by the end of the year , and to five million by 2011. sp / reuters / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 03.08.2009 50 percent fewer illegal african emigrants reaching europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a sight seen less often in the mediterranean this year an agreement between italy and libya to stem illegal immigration appears to be working .
the economic downturn in europe could also explain the sharp drop in arrivals . in the first six months of this year , approximately 15,700 people crossed the mediterranean from northern africa in an effort to try to enter europe illegally , according to a spokeswoman of the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- in brussels .
that 's a drop of more than 50 percent over the same period in 2008 , when more than 67,000 people managed to reach ports in southern europe .
an agreement between rome and tripoli , allowing italy to return illegal immigrants from eritrea to libya , was enacted in may .
that could well be the main reason for the fall in the number of arrivals , said unhcr expert , vanessa saenen .
italy , greece , spain , malta and cyprus have all reported fewer boat landings in the first half of 2009 .
6,782 refugees arrived in italy , 4,734 in greece , 3,249 in spain , 865 on malta and 94 on cyprus .
berlin criticized for helping to stop boats the head of the german branch of amnesty international , monika lueke , has criticized the german government for assisting local authorities in forcing boats carrying refugees to turn around and go back to libya . “ that amounts to assisting in breaching international law , ” lueke told the german berliner zeitung daily newspaper .
the german government could instead provide shelter for a number of refugees and review the quota on a yearly basis , she said .
“ germany can not ignore its obligation to adhere to the geneva convention , ” said lueke .
the exact number of people who died while attempting to cross the mediterranean is unknown .
around 200 boat people drowned off the coast of libya in march , 2009 .
italy and spain reported 675 drownings last year .
southern europe only part of the problem eu authorities also plan to tackle a much larger influx of illegal immigrants from asia , the middle east and africa , who try to enter europe via turkey .
the eu is due to start talks with turkey this fall to seek ways to crack down on people-smuggling rings in order to stem the flow of illegal immigrants from those regions .
many attempt to enter the eu from turkey via its border with greece .
greek authorities took 246,000 illegal immigrants into custody in 2008 , up 25 percent on the year before .
no figures are yet available for 2009 , but human rights agencies predict a slight drop , attributing it to tougher punishments for human traffickers that came into force last month .
illegal immigrants now also face jail terms of up to one year instead of three months , as in the past . wl / afp / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 03.08.2009 weak german retail sales dampen economic optimism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german retail sales for june declined by 1.8 percent month-on-month german retail sales dropped by 1.8 percent in june , denting hopes that a surge in consumer spending would help europe 's largest economy quickly climb out of recession . the provisional data published by the federal statistics office on monday fell far short of analysts ' expectations for the retail sector .
prior to the announcement , economists polled by reuters news agency predicted sales would rise by 0.5 percent . " these figures are disappointing given that the consumer sentiment indicated that retail might be stabilizing , " simon juncker , an economic researcher at commerzbank , told deutsche welle . the surprise deterioration bucks a recent run of positive reports on the economy .
the most recent gfk consumer confidence survey suggested domestic consumption would improve on the back of low inflation , while the influential ifo index showed that the mood among german business leaders improved for the fourth consecutive month in july . rising unemployment although key areas of the german economy appear to be recovering , many economists have said a significant rise in unemployment is inevitable . government statistics put the national jobless rate for july at 8.2 percent , up from 7.4 percent in september 2008 , when the global financial crisis intensified with the collapse of lehmann brothers investment bank . one major reason the german labor market has n't been hit harder by the economic downturn is the fact that many major companies have put their employees on reduced working hours as an alternative to widespread lay-offs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : economists expect the number of germans looking for work to rise dramatically later this year the strategy has helped firms and workers weather the short-term effects of the financial crisis , but its prolonged use has also created a lag between developments in key industrial sectors and their impact on the general economy . given that the german government expects gross domestic product to shrink by a record 6 percent this year , juncker said it seems unlikely that the majority of firms will be able to maintain such bridging strategies for much longer . " in the second half of the year we expect growth rates in the industrial sector , but for the labor market we are quite pessimistic , " he said .
" we expect to see deterioration there , and this will of course hit the retail sector as well . " sje / reuters / afp / ap editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

justice minister claire ward said the money will be spent on resettlement programmes for young offenders when they leave prison .
ms ward said breaking the cycle of offending was key to helping young people and creating safer communities .
the money will be split between a number of different projects .
ms ward said : " youth crime has a devastating effect on all involved , and can also set a young person up for a lifetime of re-offending .
" breaking this cycle is key to helping put young , vulnerable people back on the right path and making our towns and neighbourhoods safer and better places to live . "
' do better ' latest figures show that the frequency of youth re-offending has fallen by over 23 % and a drop of 10 % in the number of young people entering the criminal justice system .
the announcement means young people would have better access to key services and information , such as how to access education and training or how to successfully apply for a job .
director of the prison reform trust juliet lyon said the " comparatively small " investment was welcome to try and reduce shocking youth re-offending rates .
" but how much better to stop children and young people going to prison in the first place by investing in community solutions like intensive fostering , drug and alcohol treatment , mental healthcare and support for young people with learning disabilities , " she said .
" short jail sentences and overuse of custodial remand make no sense .
imprisonment leaves a lasting mark on the young .
being a former prisoner while still a teenager usually leads to wasted lives , years of misery and public expense .
