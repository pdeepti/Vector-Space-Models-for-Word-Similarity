but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .
" russia saved us .
we have hope in russia and not anyone else . " dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 17.02.2009 bremen hope to regain swagger against ac milan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stumbling bremen want to redeem themselves as the international competitions resume after the winter break , werder bremen host ac milan in the uefa cup .
the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since winning the champions league in 2007 , ac have fallen on hard times but they may find it hard to generate much offensive pressure since their star playmaker kaka is out with an injury .
mathieu flamini has been tipped one possible replacement , although he 's far more defensively oriented than the brazilian .
in other wednesday matches , resurgent stuttgart will make a frosty trip to russia to take on last year 's uefa cup winners zenit st. petersburg .
the other two german clubs in the competition also have away matched .

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he said esa need live data so its spacecraft could steer clear of the junk . jean-francois kaufeler , head of the space junk monitoring department at esoc , said , " much more monitoring needs to be done . "
experts are to meet march 30 to april 2 in darmstadt to swap ideas on how . the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- tracks about 13,000 objects in orbit , but esa estimates hundreds of thousands of distinct items are in orbit .
a fragment 1 centimeter across could knock out a satellite if it hit it at speed . steering clear of space junk is possible , but requires precise tracking data in advance , the experts said . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts are to meet march 30 to april 2 in darmstadt to swap ideas on how . the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- tracks about 13,000 objects in orbit , but esa estimates hundreds of thousands of distinct items are in orbit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 17.02.2009 bremen hope to regain swagger against ac milan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stumbling bremen want to redeem themselves as the international competitions resume after the winter break , werder bremen host ac milan in the uefa cup .
the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since winning the champions league in 2007 , ac have fallen on hard times but they may find it hard to generate much offensive pressure since their star playmaker kaka is out with an injury .
mathieu flamini has been tipped one possible replacement , although he 's far more defensively oriented than the brazilian .
in other wednesday matches , resurgent stuttgart will make a frosty trip to russia to take on last year 's uefa cup winners zenit st. petersburg .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.02.2009 prosecutor demands guilty verdict in politkovskaya murder trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was famous for her investigative reporting on human rights abuses and corruption in chechnya over two years after russian journalist anna politkovskaya was murdered , the trial is drawing to a close in moscow .
but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .

the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .

the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .

a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 17.02.2009 gm crop data must be released to public , european court says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the mon810 strain of corn officially approved by the eu is the product of the monsanto company the eu 's highest legal body , the european court of justice , has ruled that the public must have access to information about location of genetically modified crops .
it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.02.2009 prosecutor demands guilty verdict in politkovskaya murder trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was famous for her investigative reporting on human rights abuses and corruption in chechnya over two years after russian journalist anna politkovskaya was murdered , the trial is drawing to a close in moscow .
but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 17.02.2009 anger festers as south ossetians accuse europe of failing them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tskhinvali , the capital of south ossetia , is still in rubble europeans might be stunned to learn of the outrage of many in south ossetia at the presence of eu ceasefire monitors - part of an eu-brokered peace pact between georgia and russia that ended the war in august last year . memories of war in this tiny patch of farm country sitting in the shadow of the caucasus mountains are old and filled with violence .
but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .

repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 17.02.2009 bremen hope to regain swagger against ac milan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stumbling bremen want to redeem themselves as the international competitions resume after the winter break , werder bremen host ac milan in the uefa cup .
the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since winning the champions league in 2007 , ac have fallen on hard times but they may find it hard to generate much offensive pressure since their star playmaker kaka is out with an injury .
mathieu flamini has been tipped one possible replacement , although he 's far more defensively oriented than the brazilian .
in other wednesday matches , resurgent stuttgart will make a frosty trip to russia to take on last year 's uefa cup winners zenit st. petersburg .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 during a surprise visit underscoring iraq 's deepening ties with european nations that opposed the us-led invasion . steinmeier 's two-day trip to baghdad is the first by a german foreign minister in 22 years and is aimed at strengthening german-iraqi political and economic relations .
" we extend our hand to the new iraq , " steinmeier said after arriving in baghdad .
" this is our way of helping the new iraq on its path toward democratic consolidation and peaceful reconciliation between religions and ethnicities . "
steinmeier met with iraqi president jalal talabani , foreign minister hoshyar zebari and prime minister nuri al-maliki .
steinmeier also officially opened an economic information office in the iraqi capital .
" the office will help revive what used to be intensive economic relations between germany and iraq , " said economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg in berlin .
warm welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil-rich iraq offers many business opportunities for german firms the iraqi leaders said they had ever reason to believe that their country would greet increased german economic involvement very warmly .
" german companies wo n't have to undertake any special efforts in order to establish themselves here , " prime minister al maliki said .
" they used to be very active here and enjoy a fine reputation . "
since the us-led war in iraq in 2003 , which berlin did not support , german involvement in that country has largely been restricted to some low-key held with post-conflict reconstruction .
in an interview with the german bild newspaper , al-maliki said it would be " great if germany would participate even more in the rebuilding process . "
germany and france put the past behind them bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and talabani were all smiles in baghdad last week steinmeier 's trip followed that of french president nicolas sarkozy , who last week made the first visit to iraq by a european leader of a state which refused to join the us-led military coalition .
sarkozy vowed to help iraq 's economic revival and restore historically close economic ties .
" my coming here is to tell french companies : the time is at hand - come and invest , " sarkozy said during his visit .
he said that a high-level french business delegation would follow him to baghdad by the end of the summer .
the visits by the two leading politicians highlight a shift in european commitment in iraq after us president barack obama took office and a deal was reached for the more than 140,000 us troops in iraq to withdraw by the end of 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.02.2009 prosecutor demands guilty verdict in politkovskaya murder trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was famous for her investigative reporting on human rights abuses and corruption in chechnya over two years after russian journalist anna politkovskaya was murdered , the trial is drawing to a close in moscow .
but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .

the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .

kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .

western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .

half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .

several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 17.02.2009 bremen hope to regain swagger against ac milan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stumbling bremen want to redeem themselves as the international competitions resume after the winter break , werder bremen host ac milan in the uefa cup .
the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since winning the champions league in 2007 , ac have fallen on hard times but they may find it hard to generate much offensive pressure since their star playmaker kaka is out with an injury .
mathieu flamini has been tipped one possible replacement , although he 's far more defensively oriented than the brazilian .
in other wednesday matches , resurgent stuttgart will make a frosty trip to russia to take on last year 's uefa cup winners zenit st. petersburg .
the other two german clubs in the competition also have away matched .

" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .

the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sarkozy vowed to help iraq 's economic revival and restore historically close economic ties .
" my coming here is to tell french companies : the time is at hand - come and invest , " sarkozy said during his visit .
he said that a high-level french business delegation would follow him to baghdad by the end of the summer .
the visits by the two leading politicians highlight a shift in european commitment in iraq after us president barack obama took office and a deal was reached for the more than 140,000 us troops in iraq to withdraw by the end of 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .

several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .

repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 17.02.2009 anger festers as south ossetians accuse europe of failing them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tskhinvali , the capital of south ossetia , is still in rubble europeans might be stunned to learn of the outrage of many in south ossetia at the presence of eu ceasefire monitors - part of an eu-brokered peace pact between georgia and russia that ended the war in august last year . memories of war in this tiny patch of farm country sitting in the shadow of the caucasus mountains are old and filled with violence .
but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .
" russia saved us .
we have hope in russia and not anyone else . " dpa news agency -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 , it wanted its own system to protect satellites . gaele winters , who heads esa 's european space operations centre -lrb- esoc -rrb- at darmstadt , said the debris would be a danger to esa 's own satellites in the same orbit .
he said esa need live data so its spacecraft could steer clear of the junk . jean-francois kaufeler , head of the space junk monitoring department at esoc , said , " much more monitoring needs to be done . "
experts are to meet march 30 to april 2 in darmstadt to swap ideas on how . the us national aeronautics and space administration -lrb- nasa -rrb- tracks about 13,000 objects in orbit , but esa estimates hundreds of thousands of distinct items are in orbit .
a fragment 1 centimeter across could knock out a satellite if it hit it at speed . steering clear of space junk is possible , but requires precise tracking data in advance , the experts said . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the swedish automaker could file for bankruptcy this month if it does not receive additional funding , its parent company , gm , said . swedish enterprise and energy minister maud olofsson told swedish television on tuesday , feb .
17 , that " it is clear that gm wants to sell saab . "
olofsson also said the government was prepared to guarantee any loan made by the eib to saab . general motors officials said tuesday that if saab does not receive additional support , the swedish carmaker would file for bankruptcy protection " as early as this month . " " given the urgency of stemming sizeable outflows associated with saab operations , gm is requesting swedish government support prior to any sale , " gm said .

saab would need to borrow as much as 475 million euros -lrb- $ 600 million -rrb- , according to press reports . meanwhile , gm is expected to speed up its timeline for restructuring over the next 18 months , including the possible sale of its hummer and saturn brands as well as saab .

gm was granted $ 13.4 billion and chrysler $ 4 billion in emergency government loans in december . volvo cars , which is owned by us automaker ford , already requested a loan of 475 million euros from the eib at the end of january . around three-quarters of a rescue plan for the swedish car industry amounting to 28 billion kronor -lrb- 2.7 billion euros -rrb- consists of swedish government guarantees for loans from the eib . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .

several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .

the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .

16 , it wanted its own system to protect satellites . gaele winters , who heads esa 's european space operations centre -lrb- esoc -rrb- at darmstadt , said the debris would be a danger to esa 's own satellites in the same orbit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de russia -pipe- 17.02.2009 prosecutor demands guilty verdict in politkovskaya murder trial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : politkovskaya was famous for her investigative reporting on human rights abuses and corruption in chechnya over two years after russian journalist anna politkovskaya was murdered , the trial is drawing to a close in moscow .
but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .

half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .

frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .

repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .
the authorities refused , arguing that the release of such information could potentially endanger public order .
but the ecj 's ruling means that eu citizens now have a right to know where experimental crops are being tried out .
bans upheld bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have themselves identified suspected gm crop locations in a related development on monday , the european commission failed in a bid to force the governments of france and greece to allow genetically modified corn to be grown in their countries .
the mon810 strain of corn is the only gm crop officially approved by the eu , but both athens and paris have suspended its cultivation .
when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .
" we are in the middle of a process , " the commission 's environmental spokesperson , barbara helferich , said . " the regulatory committee , which could have made a decision , came to a vote that was neither for nor against .
the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .
on march 2 , eu environmental ministers will vote on whether to ask austria and hungary to lift bans similar to those in place in france and greece . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .

the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .
but many eu citizens remain sceptical about genetically modified food , and the green party , in particular is fighting to allow countries the right to ban it .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .

but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "

" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .

the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 17.02.2009 anger festers as south ossetians accuse europe of failing them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tskhinvali , the capital of south ossetia , is still in rubble europeans might be stunned to learn of the outrage of many in south ossetia at the presence of eu ceasefire monitors - part of an eu-brokered peace pact between georgia and russia that ended the war in august last year . memories of war in this tiny patch of farm country sitting in the shadow of the caucasus mountains are old and filled with violence .
but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .

repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .

the newspaper said that no decisions had been made yet on any potential buyout .
the carmaker has around 26,000 workers in germany .
the premiers of the states that host opel facilities met last week with opel representatives and the new german economics minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg .
north rhine-westphalia premier juergen ruettgers told german broadcast network ard on monday that measures had to be taken to prevent job losses in germany .
he called for patient discussions over the future of opel .
" we need a solution which is long-term , " ruettgers said of several restructuring plans drawn up by gm to be presented to the us congress , to which it has appealed for financial aid .
the economics minister said germany had to wait and see the strategy adopted by gm before it could decide on a way forward .

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .

several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .

the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de uefa cup -pipe- 17.02.2009 bremen hope to regain swagger against ac milan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stumbling bremen want to redeem themselves as the international competitions resume after the winter break , werder bremen host ac milan in the uefa cup .
the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .

" we extend our hand to the new iraq , " steinmeier said after arriving in baghdad .
" this is our way of helping the new iraq on its path toward democratic consolidation and peaceful reconciliation between religions and ethnicities . "
steinmeier met with iraqi president jalal talabani , foreign minister hoshyar zebari and prime minister nuri al-maliki .
steinmeier also officially opened an economic information office in the iraqi capital .
" the office will help revive what used to be intensive economic relations between germany and iraq , " said economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg in berlin .
warm welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil-rich iraq offers many business opportunities for german firms the iraqi leaders said they had ever reason to believe that their country would greet increased german economic involvement very warmly .
" german companies wo n't have to undertake any special efforts in order to establish themselves here , " prime minister al maliki said .
" they used to be very active here and enjoy a fine reputation . "
since the us-led war in iraq in 2003 , which berlin did not support , german involvement in that country has largely been restricted to some low-key held with post-conflict reconstruction .
in an interview with the german bild newspaper , al-maliki said it would be " great if germany would participate even more in the rebuilding process . "

sarkozy vowed to help iraq 's economic revival and restore historically close economic ties .
" my coming here is to tell french companies : the time is at hand - come and invest , " sarkozy said during his visit .
he said that a high-level french business delegation would follow him to baghdad by the end of the summer .
the visits by the two leading politicians highlight a shift in european commitment in iraq after us president barack obama took office and a deal was reached for the more than 140,000 us troops in iraq to withdraw by the end of 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.02.2009 daimler warns of rough year ahead after sharp drop in profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler says it faces all-round slumps in vehicle sales , including that of mercedes-benz german luxury auto maker daimler warned on tuesday that the group could face slumping sales in the first quarter of this year after posting a significant drop in earnings in 2008 . the carmaker 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .

daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .

" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

it 's the latest decision on a very controversial issue . the european court of justice in luxembourg handed down the ruling on tuesday , february 17 in a case that has been going on for nearly five years .
" the right of public access to information applies to releases of genetically modified organisms , " the ecj said in its decision .
" the information relating to the location of the release can in no case be kept confidential . "
in april 2004 , french citizen pierre azelvandre asked local authorities in his home region of alsace to provide a list of where gm field trials had taken place and where future ones were planned .

when put to a vote of experts , only nine of the eu 27 's member states supported the commission 's call for those two national bans to be lifted .

the expert evidence will now be handed on to eu ministers at the national level for further consideration .
the european food safety authority has said that the genetically modified corn is safe , and that there is no scientific evidence to support the bans .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de caucasus -pipe- 17.02.2009 anger festers as south ossetians accuse europe of failing them großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tskhinvali , the capital of south ossetia , is still in rubble europeans might be stunned to learn of the outrage of many in south ossetia at the presence of eu ceasefire monitors - part of an eu-brokered peace pact between georgia and russia that ended the war in august last year . memories of war in this tiny patch of farm country sitting in the shadow of the caucasus mountains are old and filled with violence .
but the raw anger among some south ossetians , huddled amid the freezing , roofless ruins left by the recent war in this separatist province , is being redirected towards a new antagonist .
south ossetians are resentful towards the european union and have expressed anger at the eu 's support of georgia and the presence of eu observers in the region .
some contempt is also saved for a separate mission of the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- , which has patrolled the region since 1992 .
like european peacekeepers , osce personnel have also been denied access to south ossetia since the war .
villager : war tearing us apart bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some south ossetians say war is destroying their way of life hysterical shouts greeted a small group of foreign journalists who tumbled out of a russian-organized bus tour to the tightly-guarded region last week .
residents shuffled up , fists raised , from their seats where the spring sun had dried the pock-marked mud in front of the village store .
there had been mortar shelling here , as evidenced by the mud holes .
" we are against europe and the osce .
how many people have to be killed , every summer , for them to see the truth ? "
svetalana bukhayeva hotly pressed journalists .
she had mistaken them for representatives of the two european missions .
" what georgia says is served up on a plate , but nobody listens to us .
we do n't understand .
we have seen nothing good from life the last 20 years but war and bombardment .
" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .
" russia saved us .

" life stops with war , " she lamented , saying only three children have been born in the village of khetagurvoa since south ossetia threw off tbilisi 's rule in a war of succession in the early 1990s .
kokoity : monitors will never enter south ossetia bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eduard kokoity , right , says eu monitors will never enter south ossetia the kremlin-backed south ossetian leadership last week accused georgia of firing two rpg-7 shells at the separatist 's provincial capital tskhinvali and accused eu observers on the georgian side of the ceasefire line with turning a blind eye to an alleged military buildup there .
south ossetian president eduard kokoity said as much at a press conference friday in tskhinvali , where local and russian media snapped pictures of him sitting in front of russian and south ossetian flags .
" where are the european observers looking ? " he fumed .
asked in an interview with german news agency dpa under what conditions he would allow eu and osce monitors access to south ossetia , kokoity replied : " they will never work here .
" never , because those organizations long ago compromised themselves .
in the face of georgian aggression they did nothing to save woman , children and the elderly .
" we do n't trust these organizations .
they have taken no responsibility .
more than anything they fulfill the function of border markers , " kokoity said .
eu presence ' preventing ' fresh conflict bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : osce monitors have been in georgia since the ceasefire was signed the eu monitoring mission -lrb- eumm -rrb- says it has found no evidence of georgian troop concentrations near the border with south ossetia , nor of preparations for military action .
" because of the south ossetian claims we were able to carry out an investigation and concluded that there was no build up in georgian forces , " eumm spokesman steve bird told dpa on monday .
" we are an independent organization with a mandate , as we see it , to monitor the whole of the country -lrb- georgia -rrb- .
we would welcome -lrb- a request for -rrb- an investigation into the claims in south ossetia to see exactly what happened , if they allowed us , " he said .
this issue will likely be one of several points of high contention in the third round of russia-georgia negotiations in geneva on feb .
17-18 .
western governments say the presence of tbilisi-based eu and osce monitors in and around south ossetia could help prevent new hostilities .
the us and europe have not recognized the independence of south ossetia , nor that of another breakaway region called abkhazia .
both were considered autonomous regions of georgia under the soviet union and until the recent august war .
frozen statehood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the august war has stirred emotions in many south ossetians moscow , meanwhile , wants to split the monitoring missions to reflect its recognition of south ossetian statehood - a south ossetian and russian goal for the last 17 years - after quashing georgia 's bid to retake the separatist territory .
half a year after the conflict , the fresh anger here is underlined by a disappointed realization that , despite recognition by russia , the state looks destined to remain locked into a strange de facto status quo , shakily dependent on moscow 's aide .
not a single house in khetaguraova , on the outskirts tskhinvali , looks to have survived unscathed from the recent conflict .
blue-painted slogans stood bright against the rusted fences and black-charred walls .
one said , " thank you russia , " while another read , " ossetia thanks its protectors . "
larisa tatayeva , a 39-year-old nurse , pointed through a shattered window pane at the village store to where she ran to hide when the georgian attack began : " i had so much shrapnel in my skin it took hours to pick out in the light of the cellar .
" we had a lot of hope in europe , but now we watch television and see they are only for georgia , " she said , nervously fiddling with the blond tips of her hair now brown half-way to the roots .

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.02.2009 daimler warns of rough year ahead after sharp drop in profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler says it faces all-round slumps in vehicle sales , including that of mercedes-benz german luxury auto maker daimler warned on tuesday that the group could face slumping sales in the first quarter of this year after posting a significant drop in earnings in 2008 . the carmaker 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

17 during a surprise visit underscoring iraq 's deepening ties with european nations that opposed the us-led invasion . steinmeier 's two-day trip to baghdad is the first by a german foreign minister in 22 years and is aimed at strengthening german-iraqi political and economic relations .
" we extend our hand to the new iraq , " steinmeier said after arriving in baghdad .
" this is our way of helping the new iraq on its path toward democratic consolidation and peaceful reconciliation between religions and ethnicities . "
steinmeier met with iraqi president jalal talabani , foreign minister hoshyar zebari and prime minister nuri al-maliki .
steinmeier also officially opened an economic information office in the iraqi capital .
" the office will help revive what used to be intensive economic relations between germany and iraq , " said economics minister karl theodor zu guttenberg in berlin .
warm welcome bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oil-rich iraq offers many business opportunities for german firms the iraqi leaders said they had ever reason to believe that their country would greet increased german economic involvement very warmly .
" german companies wo n't have to undertake any special efforts in order to establish themselves here , " prime minister al maliki said .
" they used to be very active here and enjoy a fine reputation . "
since the us-led war in iraq in 2003 , which berlin did not support , german involvement in that country has largely been restricted to some low-key held with post-conflict reconstruction .
in an interview with the german bild newspaper , al-maliki said it would be " great if germany would participate even more in the rebuilding process . "
germany and france put the past behind them bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and talabani were all smiles in baghdad last week steinmeier 's trip followed that of french president nicolas sarkozy , who last week made the first visit to iraq by a european leader of a state which refused to join the us-led military coalition .
sarkozy vowed to help iraq 's economic revival and restore historically close economic ties .
" my coming here is to tell french companies : the time is at hand - come and invest , " sarkozy said during his visit .
he said that a high-level french business delegation would follow him to baghdad by the end of the summer .
the visits by the two leading politicians highlight a shift in european commitment in iraq after us president barack obama took office and a deal was reached for the more than 140,000 us troops in iraq to withdraw by the end of 2011 . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .
all have pleaded not guilty .
a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .
politkovskaya was shot dead outside her home in moscow in october 2006 .
trial marked by repeated inconsistencies the closing arguments in the case , which is being heard in a moscow military court , were made behind closed doors on monday , feb .
16 .
the judges at the last minute ordered the public , journalists and relatives from the court so that the prosecution could cite from classified documents .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defendants sit in a cage during the trial those secret documents do not actually relate to the politkovskaya killing , but to a parallel trial for the kidnapping of a businessman in 2002 , in which one of the defendants is also accused .
repeated breakdowns and inconsistencies have marked the trial , which began in october 2008 .
the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .
" i have drawn my own conclusion that the boys have been used by someone , " moskalenko said .
" the question is whether they knew or not . "
did authorities play a role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moskalenko is a well-known human rights lawyer the main suspect in the killing is a third makhmudov brother , rustam , who is currently on the run .
many suspect the person who originally gave the order for the professional hit man-style killing is connected to russian security services .
but prosecutors have never identified who ordered the killing .
putin has rejected suggestions in the west that the kremlin could have been behind politkovskaya 's murder .
russian officials said the killing was an attempt to discredit the kremlin .
but moskalenko implied authorities played a role in the crime .
" who could hate anna -lrb- politkovskaya -rrb- for her articles ? " she said .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the match is a chance for both teams to get back on track after domestic disappointments . regardless of the outcome , werder bremen fans may want to savor the match against milan on wednesday , february 18 .
their team may well not be playing international football next season .
a fixture for many years in the champions league and the uefa cup , bremen are in the bottom half of the bundesliga table - 13 points behind leaders hertha berlin and 9 behind fifth-placed leverkusen .
a win against one of the most prestigious clubs in europe would lift some of the gloom that 's currently hanging over the weser river stadium and perhaps spark a comeback in the league .
but milan will be aiming to make amends as well .
after losing to their city rivals inter milan last weekend , ac are down to third in italy 's serie a and eleven points from the top of the table .
classic confrontation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego has had some major discipline issues with both teams highly motivated , the match promises to be one of those irresistible-force-meets-immovable-object encounters .
werder still play the same sort of up-tempo , offensive soccer they always have under coach thomas schaaf - albeit with less successful results .
they 'll be bolstered , too , by the return of brazilian playmaker diego , who 's been serving a lengthy suspension in the league .
but they 'll have to compensate for the absence of midfielder torsten frings , who 's banned for the milan match .
ac milan , on the other hand , will probably employ a defensive 4-3-2-1 formation and hope to catch bremen out on the counter-attack .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since winning the champions league in 2007 , ac have fallen on hard times but they may find it hard to generate much offensive pressure since their star playmaker kaka is out with an injury .
mathieu flamini has been tipped one possible replacement , although he 's far more defensively oriented than the brazilian .
in other wednesday matches , resurgent stuttgart will make a frosty trip to russia to take on last year 's uefa cup winners zenit st. petersburg .
the other two german clubs in the competition also have away matched .

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the crime against the kremlin critic has not been cleared up and many questions remain unanswered . the state prosecutor has called for a guilty verdict for the suspects accused of helping murder russian journalist anna politkovskaya .
" we are convinced that the people sitting on the dock are guilty in relation to the execution of the murder of politkovskaya , " state prosecutor julia safina said in her closing arguments , according to interfax news agency .
prosecutors are not accusing the defendants with directly murdering the journalist , but rather aiding and abetting the actual killer , who is on the run .
the chechen brothers dzhabrail and ibragim makhmudov are charged with helping the killer find politkovskaya .
former police officer sergei khadzhikurbanov is charged with providing technical help .
pavel ryaguzov , a former fsb security service agent , is suspected of providing politkovskaya 's home address to the killer .

a defense lawyer for the accused has suggested that more suspects should be on trial .
politkovskaya was critical of russia 's policies and human rights abuses during the war in chechnya , often attacking what she saw as russia surrendering its democratic freedoms under former president and current prime minister vladimir putin .

the prosecution initially said one of the defendants played no part in the murder , but he is now accused of helping in the killing .
colleagues and friends of politkovskaya have repeatedly complained about the standard of the investigation , with one claiming that video evidence of the crime scene had disappeared .
a lawyer for politkovskaya 's family said the men on trial are just pawns .
" the whole thing has been organized at a high level , not at the level of the defendants , " lawyer karina moskalenko said .
she said she did not believe the makhmudov brothers had their own reasons to kill politkovskaya .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 17.02.2009 daimler warns of rough year ahead after sharp drop in profits großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler says it faces all-round slumps in vehicle sales , including that of mercedes-benz german luxury auto maker daimler warned on tuesday that the group could face slumping sales in the first quarter of this year after posting a significant drop in earnings in 2008 . the carmaker 's net profits for last year plummeted by 65 percent to 1.41 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.8 billion -rrb- .
daimler said the result followed what was " a very good first half and a difficult second half " of the year .
the loss by the maker of mercedes-benz and the smart car was far worse than expected .
a poll of auto industry analysts by dow jones newswires had posited that daimler could make as much as 2.75 billion euros last year .
in 2007 , daimler raked in a net profit of 4 billion euros .
daimler chief dieter zetsche said the company is " dealing with a very difficult environment .
nobody knows how long this crisis will last . "
but zetsche said he was confident that the carmaker could make it through the current crisis in the global auto industry despite the poor results from last year .
" the daimler group is in a relatively strong position to meet the crisis , " he said .
" we have the opportunity not only to overcome this exceptional situation , but to emerge from it stronger , " he said .
" we are going to seize this opportunity . "
but while zetsche declined to speculate on whether this year 's first quarter would return a profit or a loss , he did acknowledge that the company would press on with a big cost-cutting program .
the firm has already announced one round of production cuts .
uncertain 2009 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler announced it would make production cuts to deal with the downturn auto markets and global economies slowed sharply late last year as the financial crisis gained momentum and a collection of us investment banks edged towards collapse .
several major economies moved into official recession territory and consumer confidence began to slide , dragging global car sales down with it .
" the great uncertainty about the duration and extent of the global economic downturn is connected with substantial risks for the development of the world 's automotive markets , " daimler said in a statement .
" global demand for automobiles could decrease by another 10 percent in 2009 compared with the prior year , " it added .
" prospects for the major markets for commercial vehicles are also unfavorable . "
the carmaker said " further substantial burdens " were likely to undercut the carmaker 's earnings .
" a more detailed statement on earnings will only be possible later in the year , when the development of the world economy and the automotive markets can be better assessed . " .
late 2008 losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : car dealerships are having trouble selling vehicles of all makes and models the stuttgart-based company 's earnings for last year were dragged down significantly by fourth-quarter losses of 1.53 billion euros , compared with a 1.7 billion euro profit for the same period in 2007 .
the group is proposing to cut its dividend to 0.60 euros per share , compared to 2.00 euros a year ago .
daimler warned that the global economic slowdown would dampen demand for commercial vehicles in key growth markets of asia , eastern europe and latin america .
daimler said its results were also hit by a 1.67-billion-euro write-down caused by its partial pullout from troubled us carmaker chrysler , in which it still holds a 19.9 percent stake . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

president barack obama 's administration is expected to issue the money , which would be part of a $ 13-billion interim bailout devised in december under former president george w bush .
if gm or chrysler , which is also under a serious financial cloud , can not prove that they have made the changes necessary to survive the economic downturn , the auto giants will have to give the borrowed money back to the federal government and will not receive any further loans from the state , the dpa news agency reported tuesday . dw staff -lrb- dfm -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

16 that klaus zumwinkel , 65 , did not violate his parole conditions by moving to italy .
a change of residence within the european union was not a problem for the courts , he said . the former top executive has to comply with parole conditions for three years under the terms of the sentence imposed on him in late january , which included a two-year suspended prison term as well as a fine of 1 million euros . he has already paid 23.9 million euros in late tax , interests and fees in a case that made him one of germany 's most prominent business leaders to be disgraced in court as well as the public eye . after his trial , in which he admitted keeping earnings and dividends hidden from the german tax authorities in a liechtenstein fund , he had said he planned to work as an entrepreneur and investor . should i stay or should i go ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zumwinkel has left some lucrative positions but is keeping others he also said he planned to keep non-paid positions with the post foundation and the institute for the study of labour , a research organization that is also run by deutsche post . zumwinkel had been briefly detained in february 2008 after prosecutors obtained evidence from germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service on trusts managed by the ltg bank in liechtenstein on behalf of wealthy tax-shy europeans . the charges against him related to 970,000 euros in undeclared taxes between 2002 and 2007 .
because of a missed deadline , he escaped being charged for a larger sum , which could have resulted in him going to prison . released on bail after a search of his villa , zumwinkel resigned shortly afterwards as head of deutsche post , one of the world 's leading logistics companies with a global workforce of more than 500,000 . later , he stepped down from positions on the boards of other leading companies such as deutsche telekom , lufthansa and retail and travel concern arcandor . zumwinkel was one of hundreds of wealthy germans exposed when a liechtenstein bank executive betrayed them by selling a dvd with details of their accounts to the bnd for about 5 million euros . since then , german prosecutors have recovered more than 150 million euros in arrears from repentant taxpayers hoping to ward off trials . dpa news agency -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now john suchet is talking publicly for the first time about one of the toughest events in his life .
dementia is slowly robbing him of his wife of more than 20 years , bonnie .
he told bbc news : " i 've gone from being a lover to a carer . "
she began to develop symptoms of the devastating brain disease in her early 60s , and is now aged 67 .
she was diagnosed with dementia three years ago , after sporadic instances of forgetfulness and confusion .
doctors think bonnie suchet has alzheimer 's disease .
her husband prefers to call it " the a word " .
' love and cherish ' mr suchet , 64 , said : " by and large , her morale is good .
she 's happy .
she smiles at me .
" i should be grateful because she 's co-operative most of the time .
" i promised myself after the diagnosis , ' right , john , you will be an understanding husband - you will love and cherish your wife . '
" life is n't that simple .
every now and then , you just explode .
" it 's a culmination of little things - dinner plates going straight back onto the shelf instead of going into the dishwasher or being wiped dry while they were still dirty . "
mr suchet has been able to air his distress and guilt by meeting regularly with an admiral nurse , who is a specialist nurse working with dementia sufferers but particularly their carers .
guilty feelings the nurse , ian weatherhead , said : " i first met john and bonnie two years ago .
at that time , he needed a release .
" there was frustration in trying to manage bonnie 's behaviour , and also denial about alzheimer 's disease , and confusion about what it meant . "
i keep thinking i 'm a complete failure and i 'm useless at being a carer " john suchet read your emails " john comes to see me down at my office - and sometimes i see him at home , so i can monitor bonnie and see what 's changed for her .
" i 've yet to meet a carer who has n't shouted , sworn or got angry at the person they 're looking after - and then felt guilty .
families row .
it 's a normal part of life .
" and yet people feel so bad about it when they 're caring for someone with dementia , because they 're exhibiting emotions to someone who ca n't understand or comprehend what 's going on .
" john 's a great guy to work with - and being the journalist he is , he takes copious notes on everything we talk about . "
limited nursing mr suchet is taking part in a fundraising event in central london , in aid of for dementia , the charity which funds admiral nurses .
he has access to the specialist help because he lives in a part of london where the nhs has paid for eight such nurses .
there are only about 70 admiral nurses in england , and one service in north wales , in flintshire .
scotland does n't yet have any .
mr suchet said : " there should be 70,000 of them .
" the best bit of advice ian gave me was to beat the living daylights out of a cushion every now and then .
it works .
" i keep thinking i 'm a complete failure and i 'm useless at being a carer .
but ian tells me i 'm actually doing quite well . "
the former itn correspondent and newsreader is still presenting a daily live quiz show , going for gold , on five .
he told me the work is " good therapy " .
he adores classical music and has written five books about beethoven .
all are dedicated to bonnie .
it is of huge sadness to mr suchet that his wife can no longer share what used to be a joint passion .
he said : " we went to every place that beethoven ever went to that is still there to be seen .
she loved it .
i loved it .
" but now she looks at the books and she says , ' bloody beethoven - i 've had enough of him . '
" i have to stop myself from saying , ' you were n't like that before . '
i have to remind myself it 's not my bonnie who 's talking .
" she 's gone .
and yet she 's physically still there . "

thirty londoners have been killed for one or more of these reasons in the past two years .
home office figures show that every murder costs the authorities about £ 1.5m to investigate and prosecute and consequently , preventing a fatal stabbing or shooting has gained more currency .
next month , a new gangs ' mediation service called capital conflict management will begin work in london to try to tackle the problem .
with £ 300,000 funding for two years , mediators will use the art of " straight-talking " to resolve potential conflict , liaising with gangs , community , police and councils .
the idea has been in practise in the west midlands for the past five years where deaths reduced from 27 to three .
the project began after gang-related violence in birmingham in 2003 resulted in 27 murders , including that of two girls . "
it works because kids do n't want to die .
parents do n't want them to die " kirk dawes , wmmts kirk dawes , a former detective with west midlands police , is a founder member of west midlands mediation and transformation service -lrb- wmmts -rrb- .
" when we first started , it was claimed to be fluffy , " he said .
a core team of 10 mediators now work across birmingham and come from varied backgrounds - from firefighter and forensic psychologist , to bank worker and students .
they go between and within gangs talking to members dealing with " trivial issues " like name-calling to extreme violence like stabbing .
' death sentence ' mr dawes said : " if someone survives then they often want ' compo ' -lrb- compensation -rrb- .
" they want paying .
it can be £ 5,000 , it can be £ 15,000 .
" but if the individual agrees and then ca n't pay up , he 's putting a death sentence on himself . "
an experienced mediator can help the individual avoid these pitfalls .
mediators use techniques which draw inspiration from the good friday agreement in northern ireland and a gang project in new jersey .
mr dawes said : " it works because kids do n't want to die .
parents do n't want them to die . "
marcus -lrb- name changed for fear of reprisals -rrb- , aged 19 , was a former gang member in birmingham who " used to run " with the johnson crew - one of the two main gangs in the city . "
it was like living with a ticking time bomb " jane , marcus 's mother hailed as one of the project 's success stories , marcus is now studying performing arts .
" due to the gangs and fighting and all that rubbish i have lost 11 friends . "
" if it was n't for the service , i would definitely have been given payback without a shadow of a doubt .
" most likely i would have been the next life to go .
mediation taught me to think differently , " he said .
his mother jane -lrb- name changed -rrb- said : " it was like living with a ticking time bomb .
" you never knew what kind of moods you would encounter , when he would come home , where he was .
" it was an emotional roller-coaster .
and it affects every member of the family . "
' high impact players ' she said the service also helped her deal with marcus 's volatile behaviour .
" thank god now we can see a massive turnaround and a different young man , " she said .
to tackle the problem in london wmmts has trained 24 mediators who have been on a six-day intensive course where they were taught to deal with " high-risk " situations .
mediators learnt counter-surveillance techniques and were told how to stay safe , including being given stab-proof vests .
recently , the metropolitan police identified more than 100 distinct street gangs which have about 1,600 so-called " high impact players " , who display extreme , violent behaviour .
a further 2,000 " associates " are closely linked to each gangs ' criminal activity .
mediators in london will mostly be dealing with issues like drugs or disrespect but would step in to prevent a grievance from turning nasty or intervene after a violent incident to try to stop retaliation attacks .
and , like marcus , help young people escape the gun and gang culture .
len duvall , former chairman of the metropolitan police authority , supports the idea in principle but warned : " we can not afford to legitimise criminal activity or to confer some status to those gangs in our communities . "
mr dawes is confident that mediation will have an impact in london .
" if you put your hand on a gun or a knife , " he said .
" there are two things that can happen .
one , you go to the grave or the other , you can go to prison for a very long time .
" if you use words rather than weapons , and get in before the conflict gets going - then you stand a chance of stopping it . "

with £ 300,000 funding for two years , mediators will use the art of " straight-talking " to resolve potential conflict , liaising with gangs , community , police and councils .

thirty londoners have been killed for one or more of these reasons in the past two years .
home office figures show that every murder costs the authorities about £ 1.5m to investigate and prosecute and consequently , preventing a fatal stabbing or shooting has gained more currency .
next month , a new gangs ' mediation service called capital conflict management will begin work in london to try to tackle the problem .
with £ 300,000 funding for two years , mediators will use the art of " straight-talking " to resolve potential conflict , liaising with gangs , community , police and councils .
the idea has been in practise in the west midlands for the past five years where deaths reduced from 27 to three .
the project began after gang-related violence in birmingham in 2003 resulted in 27 murders , including that of two girls .
it works because kids do n't want to die .
parents do n't want them to die kirk dawes , wmmts kirk dawes , a former detective with west midlands police , is a founder member of west midlands mediation and transformation service -lrb- wmmts -rrb- .
" when we first started , it was claimed to be fluffy , " he said .
a core team of 10 mediators now work across birmingham and come from varied backgrounds - from firefighter and forensic psychologist , to bank worker and students .
they go between and within gangs talking to members dealing with " trivial issues " like name-calling to extreme violence like stabbing .
' death sentence ' mr dawes said : " if someone survives then they often want ' compo ' -lrb- compensation -rrb- .
" they want paying .
it can be £ 5,000 , it can be £ 15,000 .
" but if the individual agrees and then ca n't pay up , he 's putting a death sentence on himself . "
an experienced mediator can help the individual avoid these pitfalls .
thirty people died in gang violence in london in the last two years mediators use techniques which draw inspiration from the good friday agreement in northern ireland and a gang project in new jersey .
mr dawes said : " it works because kids do n't want to die .
parents do n't want them to die . "
marcus -lrb- name changed for fear of reprisals -rrb- , aged 19 , was a former gang member in birmingham who " used to run " with the johnson crew - one of the two main gangs in the city .
it was like living with a ticking time bomb jane , marcus 's mother hailed as one of the project 's success stories , marcus is now studying performing arts .
" due to the gangs and fighting and all that rubbish i have lost 11 friends . "
" if it was n't for the service , i would definitely have been given payback without a shadow of a doubt .
" most likely i would have been the next life to go .
mediation taught me to think differently , " he said .
his mother jane -lrb- name changed -rrb- said : " it was like living with a ticking time bomb .
" you never knew what kind of moods you would encounter , when he would come home , where he was .
" it was an emotional roller-coaster .
and it affects every member of the family . "
' high impact players ' she said the service also helped her deal with marcus 's volatile behaviour .
" thank god now we can see a massive turnaround and a different young man , " she said .
to tackle the problem in london wmmts has trained 24 mediators who have been on a six-day intensive course where they were taught to deal with " high-risk " situations .
mediators learnt counter-surveillance techniques and were told how to stay safe , including being given stab-proof vests .
metropolitan police have identified more than 100 street gangs in london recently , the metropolitan police identified more than 100 distinct street gangs which have about 1,600 so-called " high impact players " , who display extreme , violent behaviour .
a further 2,000 " associates " are closely linked to each gangs ' criminal activity .
mediators in london will mostly be dealing with issues like drugs or disrespect but would step in to prevent a grievance from turning nasty or intervene after a violent incident to try to stop retaliation attacks .
and , like marcus , help young people escape the gun and gang culture .
len duvall , former chairman of the metropolitan police authority , supports the idea in principle but warned : " we can not afford to legitimise criminal activity or to confer some status to those gangs in our communities . "
mr dawes is confident that mediation will have an impact in london .
" if you put your hand on a gun or a knife , " he said .
" there are two things that can happen .
one , you go to the grave or the other , you can go to prison for a very long time .
" if you use words rather than weapons , and get in before the conflict gets going - then you stand a chance of stopping it . "

a spokesman for governor arnold schwarzenegger made the announcement after california lawmakers failed to approve a $ 40bn -lrb- £ 28.2bn -rrb- budget .
california , the world 's eighth biggest economy , has been hit by the housing crisis , unemployment and falling consumer spending .
the jobs on the government payroll would be cut in june .
it would be done in preparation for the next fiscal year , which starts in july .
" in the absence of a budget , the governor has a responsibility to realise state savings any way he can , " said aaron mclear , a spokesman for republican governor schwarzenegger .
" this is unfortunately a necessary decision . "
the budget would include spending cuts and tax increases to close the state 's budget deficit .
california has already laid off state workers for two days a month , put 2,000 public projects on hold and delayed tax refunds .
the state controller predicts california will run out of cash by the end of february if lawmakers do not solve the budget crisis .

the chennai-born 42-year-old is earning yet more plaudits as the man behind the soundtrack for danny boyle 's hit movie slumdog millionaire .
having won a bafta film award on sunday for best original score , he is now waiting to see if he will receive the same accolade when the academy awards are held in los angeles on 22 february .
he also has two nominations in the best song category for his exhilarating anthems jai ho and o saya - the latter featuring british hip-hop artist mia .
how has it been to be part of slumdog millionaire 's remarkable awards success ?
it 's been a great two months .
right after all the tragedies in mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- , i lost my sound engineer who was very close to me - it all happened in the same week .
then the golden globe nominations were announced and all those good things happened , to cheer me up i guess .
it 's a dream come true .
mia did n't let her pregnancy stop her appearing at the grammys on sunday .
will she perform at the oscars ?
that 's the million dollar question .
she wants to .
in fact , she said she 'll do it with a hologram .
she has all these ideas .
i do n't know how it 's going to be possible , though .
having a baby is such an important thing in your life - more important than winning an oscar .
how surprised were you to have two of your songs nominated ?
it was really surprising - i had very low expectations .
i thought jai ho would get probably one .
it was great to get two .
we were surprised bruce springsteen 's song from the wrestler was n't there after it won the golden globe .
o saya and jai ho appear at opposite ends of danny boyle 's film .
what were your intentions with the two tracks ?
unlike conventional scores , which go underneath certain scenes , danny wanted every piece of music to be a highlight and to drive the film .
with o saya , we wanted to kick-start the film - to tell the audience , " this is the ride you 're going to take , here we come " .
jai ho , which means " be victorious " , is almost like an encore .
it 's amazing - when you go to america they get up and cheer .
not everyone has been so delighted with slumdog 's success .
have n't there been objections in india to the title ?
there are a couple of cases , saying it shows the country in a poor light .
but being an ambassador for fighting poverty for the un , i believe this film will make a greater statement than any politician or lobbyist .
i hope this will be a positive step towards eradicating poverty .
in mumbai , you have the richest man in the world and the poorest person in the world co-existing side by side , which is a shame .
you ca n't accept that .
we understand you 're not keen on " bollywood " either ...
i hate the word .
i think it 's derivative and it does n't represent the entire film community in india .
there 's the eastern film industry , four industries in the south - they all make extraordinary films .
it 's like saying the whole of the west is hollywood .
kylie minogue presented you with your bafta .
is n't she set to appear in a film you 're working on ?
yes , we 're doing a song together which she 'll perform in the movie .
the film is called blue and is being shot in hawaii and a lot of other places .
ar rahman was speaking to bbc news entertainment reporter neil smith .

rahman -lrb- left -rrb- took just three weeks to complete the slumdog score the chennai-born 42-year-old is earning yet more plaudits as the man behind the soundtrack for danny boyle 's hit movie slumdog millionaire .
having won a bafta film award on sunday for best original score , he is now waiting to see if he will receive the same accolade when the academy awards are held in los angeles on 22 february .
he also has two nominations in the best song category for his exhilarating anthems jai ho and o saya - the latter featuring british hip-hop artist mia .
how has it been to be part of slumdog millionaire 's remarkable awards success ?
it 's been a great two months .
right after all the tragedies in mumbai -lrb- bombay -rrb- , i lost my sound engineer who was very close to me - it all happened in the same week .
then the golden globe nominations were announced and all those good things happened , to cheer me up i guess .
it 's a dream come true .
some slum dwellers in mumbai have taken issue with the film 's title mia did n't let her pregnancy stop her appearing at the grammys on sunday .
will she perform at the oscars ?
that 's the million dollar question .
she wants to .
in fact , she said she 'll do it with a hologram .
she has all these ideas .
i do n't know how it 's going to be possible , though .
having a baby is such an important thing in your life - more important than winning an oscar .
how surprised were you to have two of your songs nominated ?
it was really surprising - i had very low expectations .
i thought jai ho would get probably one .
it was great to get two .
we were surprised bruce springsteen 's song from the wrestler was n't there after it won the golden globe .
please turn on javascript .
media requires javascript to play .
o saya and jai ho appear at opposite ends of danny boyle 's film .
what were your intentions with the two tracks ?
unlike conventional scores , which go underneath certain scenes , danny wanted every piece of music to be a highlight and to drive the film .
with o saya , we wanted to kick-start the film - to tell the audience , " this is the ride you 're going to take , here we come " .
jai ho , which means " be victorious " , is almost like an encore .
it 's amazing - when you go to america they get up and cheer .
rahman is best known in the uk for his west end musical bombay dreams not everyone has been so delighted with slumdog 's success .
have n't there been objections in india to the title ?
there are a couple of cases , saying it shows the country in a poor light .
but being an ambassador for fighting poverty for the un , i believe this film will make a greater statement than any politician or lobbyist .
i hope this will be a positive step towards eradicating poverty .
in mumbai , you have the richest man in the world and the poorest person in the world co-existing side by side , which is a shame .
you ca n't accept that .

advertisement eight thousand people have a stroke in wales but there are still too few hospitals with special units to look after them .
services for stroke victims in wales are the worst in the uk , a leading stroke expert has claimed .
dr tony rudd , who assessed services in wales , england and northern ireland two years ago , said services in wales were " scandalously bad " .
he makes the claim in bbc wales ' week in week out , which investigated the issues with stroke treatment provision .
however , the wales stroke alliance , set up by the assembly government , said improvements had been made to services .
dr rudd has kept tabs on any improvements to the stroke services in wales since his assessment in 2007 he said they had " remained virtually stationary " in wales over the 10 years he had been assessing them .
welsh politicians should be ashamed of themselves for letting the situation drift , he said .
brain scan the week in week out investigation of stroke treatment provision in wales found that specialist services in powys were particularly scarce .
the programme also found there are too few hospital staff available in wales to scan or assess stroke victims at weekends .
many hospitals do not meet the best practice guidelines of administering a brain scan within 24 hours and administering physiotherapy within 72 hours , week in week out discovered .
however , the welsh assembly government said that from march this year , all stroke patients would be able to access a fully fledged stroke unit in wales .
dr anne freeman , chair of the wales stroke alliance , added that improvements had been made over the last year .

media requires javascript to play .
she said there were now three hospitals offering special clot-busting drugs for stroke victims compared with none two years ago .
the royal glamorgan hospital in llantrisant near cardiff has also developed a service with 24/7 scanning for stroke victims .
dr freeman said she hoped that by 2010 , stroke patients in wales would get a service as good as that found in england .
leadership in 2007 , the assembly government committed £ 7.5m over three years to improvements .
but this is around half that pledged by northern ireland , which has a smaller population .
but dr chris jones , clinical director of the abertawe bro morgannwg university nhs trust said it was still some way off from establishing a dedicated stroke unit .
" we are many many millions of pounds away from that situation , " he said .
" i feel that with finances as tight as they are in the country and the nhs at the moment , we are not going to achieve that for a long period of time .
" we are probably going to have to settle for less stroke units in less hospitals initially . "
dr richard dewar , who runs the stroke service at the royal glamorgan hospital said wales was lacking the leadership required to get a long term stroke strategy in place .
health minister edwina hart did not want to contribute to the programme .
the wales stroke alliance was established by the welsh assembly government to support a partnership , which advised on improving care .
week in week out : how not to have a stroke in wales is shown at 2235 gmt on tuesday , 17 february , on bbc one wales .

he makes the claim in bbc wales ' week in week out , which investigated the issues with stroke treatment provision .
however , the wales stroke alliance , set up by the assembly government , said improvements had been made to services .
dr rudd has kept tabs on any improvements to the stroke services in wales since his assessment in 2007 he said they had " remained virtually stationary " in wales over the 10 years he had been assessing them .
welsh politicians should be ashamed of themselves for letting the situation drift , he said .
brain scan the week in week out investigation of stroke treatment provision in wales found that specialist services in powys were particularly scarce .
the programme also found there are too few hospital staff available in wales to scan or assess stroke victims at weekends .
many hospitals do not meet the best practice guidelines of administering a brain scan within 24 hours and administering physiotherapy within 72 hours , week in week out discovered .
however , the welsh assembly government said that from march this year , all stroke patients would be able to access a fully fledged stroke unit in wales .

elizabeth wong , one of malaysia 's top human rights activists , blamed government " gutter politics " for the release of the images .
newspapers have speculated that the images were taken by an ex-boyfriend .
as a single woman in a conservative society , she has been criticised by male politicians for her independence .
" i wish to state that i am not ashamed of my sexuality as a woman and a single person , " ms wong , 37 , said in an emotional news conference .
" i have broken no laws .

opposition officials said a decision would be made later on whether to accept the resignation , which would trigger a by-election in selangor .
ms wong said she believed that the governing national front coalition would " continue to manipulate the situation " .
" accordingly i have decided to make a stand in the interests of the party and its struggle for the people , " she said , as a group of supporters holding flowers and banners yelled support .
she said it was " an insidious and under-handed attempt " to smear her reputation , adding that " the real objective is to discredit the party " .
this is the latest incident in malaysian politics to intrude into the private lives of politicians - most of whom have been opposition figures .
the government has denied a role in the scandals .

the cheque , which is 350 years old on 16 february , is said to be in irreversible decline as innovation points towards a cashless society .
banks will increasingly battle for a consumer to use one card exclusively .
but as consumers prepare to pay and access accounts using their mobiles , retailers are worried costs will rise .
pay date by 2015 , the number of payments made by cash in the uk will be overtaken for the first time by other ways of paying , according to apacs .
at the end of this year , three million barclays customers will be able to press their debit card to a sensor in more than 8,000 uk shops to register a payment .
meanwhile , the uk could mirror technology already used in east asia where the chip now found in a plastic card is placed in an everyday item such as a mobile phone or a watch .
this is then pushed against a sensor in a shop to pay , and is known as " contactless " technology .
see how contactless technology works fingerprint recognition is already being used .
some children press a digit to a sensor to register when they have a school dinner .
and mastercard plans to allow people to pay their bills through messages on their mobile phones .
but andrew bailey , chief cashier at the bank of england , told the bbc that notes and pennies would still survive the test of time .
" i do not see the banknote dying out in the next ten years .
it is not just me saying that because i sign them ; there is a demand that i ca n't see going away , " said mr bailey , whose signature is on every banknote .
moribund cheques the future of the chequebook is far less secure , with numerous retailers refusing to accept them and consumers increasingly turning to electronic payments instead .
" those aged in their 20s do n't know what a chequebook is , and those in their 30s do n't know where their chequebook is , " said sandra quinn of apacs .
the earliest cheque in the uk was thought to have been written 350 years ago , dated 16 february .
it was made out for £ 400 , signed by nicholas vanacker , made payable to a mr delboe , and drawn on messrs morris and clayton - scriveners and bankers of the city of london .
the cheque 's predecessor was the bill of exchange - a way for traders to buy and sell goods without the need to carry cumbersome and valuable quantities of gold and silver .
in the early days , cheques were used relatively infrequently , mainly by merchants and traders for high-value transactions .
they had to be confident that these handwritten pieces of paper could be guaranteed .
so they were often issued by goldsmiths within a local network of traders who knew and trusted each other .
printing processes meant they started to be used by customers of commercial banks , peaking a generation ago in 1990 .
however now they are used for things like paying tradespeople , or by parents paying for children 's school meals or trips .
cheque volumes fell at their fastest rate ever in 2007 , down by 10 % , with personal cheques accounting for only 6 % of all personal non-cash transactions .
the payments industry discussed the possibility of phasing out cheques in the uk by 2018 , but concluded that the alternatives had not developed sufficiently .
as well as electronic transfer of funds on the internet , the most likely replacement for the cheque is mobile payments .
a phone number acts as a proxy for a bank account number .
so instead of paying , for example , the plumber by cheque - he or she could be paid by an exchange of text messages .
in the netherlands , the cheque is no longer used at all .
its use is also rare in belgium , germany , switzerland and sweden .
but it is used much more commonly in the us than in the uk .
security fears when new technology affects banking services , consumers are naturally concerned about security . "
cash is coming back because it is easier to control in tough times " richard dodd british retail consortium where do we spend our cash ?
the history of payments special report : when the penny drops contactless cards will have a limit of £ 10 for each transaction .
occasionally , cardholders will be asked to enter their pin , as they will for purchases above £ 10 .
no cash-back will be available .
the card provider covers any losses if a card is stolen and the customer reports the loss at the earliest opportunity and does not act negligently .
the providers also say it is impossible to clone and any intercepted data would not work if an attempt was made to use it .
the decline of the cheque has slowed owing to security measures , with some companies ensuring a dual signature on cheques to maintain internal security .
a closer look at apacs forecast for the decline of non-cash payments suggests that the move away from cheques , notes and coins has not been as speedy as they expected .
previous reports by the payments association suggested that non-cash payments would overtake cash transactions as early as 2011 .
now , the prediction is 2015 .
digital money has also been talked about for years and has never quite taken off , according to many experts .
a spokeswoman for apacs said that it would take time for consumers and retailers to migrate to new technology , but the move away from cash was already happening .
' cash comeback ' ?
however , the british retail consortium -lrb- brc -rrb- is adamant in its view that cash has a significant present and future , especially during a recession when people are looking to budget .
" cash is coming back because it is easier to control in tough times , " said richard dodd , head of campaigns at the brc .
he said many of the same arguments were made when credit cards were introduced 40 years ago .
the association of convenience stores -lrb- acs -rrb- said that while contactless could cut the queues at busy commuter shops , such as newsagents , it feared that retailers would miss out on sales because of the £ 10 limit on contactless purchases .
a recent brc survey claimed that credit cards accounted for 11 % of transactions , but 49 % of retailers ' costs in accepting them .
shopkeepers liked cash , the brc said , because it was the cheapest to process .
the biggest single cost of card payment collection was the bank merchant service charges , it said .
these cost the retailer 2p per transaction for cash , compared with nearly 8p for debit cards , 35p for credit cards , and 53p for cheques .
however , the brc 's figures are disputed by at least one card provider .
wallet battle as a result , mr dodd claimed that the card providers made more from retailers who took card , rather than cash , payments .
have your say " i do my best to use cash for everything from flights to bananas .
i do n't want to be monitored , checked , controlled . "
tio terry , epsom , surrey send us your comments he called on them to amend their charges to reflect the " true cost " of processing .
the banks would dispute this view , but there is no doubt that they would benefit if their brand of card was used most frequently .
this battle to be the " front of wallet " card means that the providers are pushing to have a range of features on one card .
some forecasters expect consumers to soon be able to use one card for debit , credit and transport payments , as well as being used for small transactions usually paid for with loose change .
all those payments and a bank account could then be tracked on a mobile phone .
all this suggests that cheques , notes and coins could be dropped eventually , but plenty of groups will be ready to challenge that particular penny pincher .
1 .
a customer approaches the till to buy a newspaper and the shopkeeper punches in the amount to be paid 2 .
as the contactless card is pressed close to the terminal , the reader powers up the chip within the card .
account numbers and encryption details are sent between them before the terminal approves the sale 3 .
the terminal sends a message to the acquiring bank , which sends a message to the card operator , which contacts the card provider .
money is then taken from the customer 's account to pay the shopkeeper .
the whole process takes a matter of seconds and builds on the technology used for chip-and-pin .

the association of convenience stores -lrb- acs -rrb- said that while contactless could cut the queues at busy commuter shops , such as newsagents , it feared that retailers would miss out on sales because of the £ 10 limit on contactless purchases .
a recent brc survey claimed that credit cards accounted for 11 % of transactions , but 49 % of retailers ' costs in accepting them .
shopkeepers liked cash , the brc said , because it was the cheapest to process .
the biggest single cost of card payment collection was the bank merchant service charges , it said .
these cost the retailer 2p per transaction for cash , compared with nearly 8p for debit cards , 35p for credit cards , and 53p for cheques .
however , the brc 's figures are disputed by at least one card provider .
wallet battle as a result , mr dodd claimed that the card providers made more from retailers who took card , rather than cash , payments .

i do n't want to be monitored , checked , controlled .
tio terry , epsom , surrey send us your comments he called on them to amend their charges to reflect the " true cost " of processing .
the banks would dispute this view , but there is no doubt that they would benefit if their brand of card was used most frequently .
this battle to be the " front of wallet " card means that the providers are pushing to have a range of features on one card .
some forecasters expect consumers to soon be able to use one card for debit , credit and transport payments , as well as being used for small transactions usually paid for with loose change .
all those payments and a bank account could then be tracked on a mobile phone .
all this suggests that cheques , notes and coins could be dropped eventually , but plenty of groups will be ready to challenge that particular penny pincher .

account numbers and encryption details are sent between them before the terminal approves the sale 3 .
the terminal sends a message to the acquiring bank , which sends a message to the card operator , which contacts the card provider .
money is then taken from the customer 's account to pay the shopkeeper .
the whole process takes a matter of seconds and builds on the technology used for chip-and-pin .

the cheque , which is 350 years old on 16 february , is said to be in irreversible decline as innovation points towards a cashless society .
banks will increasingly battle for a consumer to use one card exclusively .
but as consumers prepare to pay and access accounts using their mobiles , retailers are worried costs will rise .
pay date by 2015 , the number of payments made by cash in the uk will be overtaken for the first time by other ways of paying , according to apacs .
at the end of this year , three million barclays customers will be able to press their debit card to a sensor in more than 8,000 uk shops to register a payment .
meanwhile , the uk could mirror technology already used in east asia where the chip now found in a plastic card is placed in an everyday item such as a mobile phone or a watch .
this is then pushed against a sensor in a shop to pay , and is known as " contactless " technology .
see how contactless technology works fingerprint recognition is already being used .

but andrew bailey , chief cashier at the bank of england , told the bbc that notes and pennies would still survive the test of time .
" i do not see the banknote dying out in the next ten years .
it is not just me saying that because i sign them ; there is a demand that i ca n't see going away , " said mr bailey , whose signature is on every banknote .
moribund cheques the future of the chequebook is far less secure , with numerous retailers refusing to accept them and consumers increasingly turning to electronic payments instead .
" those aged in their 20s do n't know what a chequebook is , and those in their 30s do n't know where their chequebook is , " said sandra quinn of apacs .
the earliest cheque in the uk was thought to have been written 350 years ago , dated 16 february .
it was made out for £ 400 , signed by nicholas vanacker , made payable to a mr delboe , and drawn on messrs morris and clayton - scriveners and bankers of the city of london .
the cheque 's predecessor was the bill of exchange - a way for traders to buy and sell goods without the need to carry cumbersome and valuable quantities of gold and silver .
in the early days , cheques were used relatively infrequently , mainly by merchants and traders for high-value transactions .
they had to be confident that these handwritten pieces of paper could be guaranteed .
so they were often issued by goldsmiths within a local network of traders who knew and trusted each other .
printing processes meant they started to be used by customers of commercial banks , peaking a generation ago in 1990 .
however now they are used for things like paying tradespeople , or by parents paying for children 's school meals or trips .

cheque volumes fell at their fastest rate ever in 2007 , down by 10 % , with personal cheques accounting for only 6 % of all personal non-cash transactions .

the card provider covers any losses if a card is stolen and the customer reports the loss at the earliest opportunity and does not act negligently .
the providers also say it is impossible to clone and any intercepted data would not work if an attempt was made to use it .
the decline of the cheque has slowed owing to security measures , with some companies ensuring a dual signature on cheques to maintain internal security .
a closer look at apacs forecast for the decline of non-cash payments suggests that the move away from cheques , notes and coins has not been as speedy as they expected .

he said many of the same arguments were made when credit cards were introduced 40 years ago .
the association of convenience stores -lrb- acs -rrb- said that while contactless could cut the queues at busy commuter shops , such as newsagents , it feared that retailers would miss out on sales because of the £ 10 limit on contactless purchases .
a recent brc survey claimed that credit cards accounted for 11 % of transactions , but 49 % of retailers ' costs in accepting them .
shopkeepers liked cash , the brc said , because it was the cheapest to process .
the biggest single cost of card payment collection was the bank merchant service charges , it said .
these cost the retailer 2p per transaction for cash , compared with nearly 8p for debit cards , 35p for credit cards , and 53p for cheques .
however , the brc 's figures are disputed by at least one card provider .

the banks would dispute this view , but there is no doubt that they would benefit if their brand of card was used most frequently .
this battle to be the " front of wallet " card means that the providers are pushing to have a range of features on one card .
some forecasters expect consumers to soon be able to use one card for debit , credit and transport payments , as well as being used for small transactions usually paid for with loose change .
all those payments and a bank account could then be tracked on a mobile phone .
all this suggests that cheques , notes and coins could be dropped eventually , but plenty of groups will be ready to challenge that particular penny pincher .

the cheque , which is 350 years old on 16 february , is said to be in irreversible decline as innovation points towards a cashless society .
banks will increasingly battle for a consumer to use one card exclusively .
but as consumers prepare to pay and access accounts using their mobiles , retailers are worried costs will rise .
pay date by 2015 , the number of payments made by cash in the uk will be overtaken for the first time by other ways of paying , according to apacs .
at the end of this year , three million barclays customers will be able to press their debit card to a sensor in more than 8,000 uk shops to register a payment .
meanwhile , the uk could mirror technology already used in east asia where the chip now found in a plastic card is placed in an everyday item such as a mobile phone or a watch .
this is then pushed against a sensor in a shop to pay , and is known as " contactless " technology .
see how contactless technology works fingerprint recognition is already being used .
some children press a digit to a sensor to register when they have a school dinner .
and mastercard plans to allow people to pay their bills through messages on their mobile phones .
but andrew bailey , chief cashier at the bank of england , told the bbc that notes and pennies would still survive the test of time .
" i do not see the banknote dying out in the next ten years .
it is not just me saying that because i sign them ; there is a demand that i ca n't see going away , " said mr bailey , whose signature is on every banknote .
moribund cheques the future of the chequebook is far less secure , with numerous retailers refusing to accept them and consumers increasingly turning to electronic payments instead .
" those aged in their 20s do n't know what a chequebook is , and those in their 30s do n't know where their chequebook is , " said sandra quinn of apacs .
the earliest cheque in the uk was thought to have been written 350 years ago , dated 16 february .
it was made out for £ 400 , signed by nicholas vanacker , made payable to a mr delboe , and drawn on messrs morris and clayton - scriveners and bankers of the city of london .
the cheque 's predecessor was the bill of exchange - a way for traders to buy and sell goods without the need to carry cumbersome and valuable quantities of gold and silver .
in the early days , cheques were used relatively infrequently , mainly by merchants and traders for high-value transactions .
they had to be confident that these handwritten pieces of paper could be guaranteed .
so they were often issued by goldsmiths within a local network of traders who knew and trusted each other .
printing processes meant they started to be used by customers of commercial banks , peaking a generation ago in 1990 .
however now they are used for things like paying tradespeople , or by parents paying for children 's school meals or trips .

cheque volumes fell at their fastest rate ever in 2007 , down by 10 % , with personal cheques accounting for only 6 % of all personal non-cash transactions .
the payments industry discussed the possibility of phasing out cheques in the uk by 2018 , but concluded that the alternatives had not developed sufficiently .
as well as electronic transfer of funds on the internet , the most likely replacement for the cheque is mobile payments .
a phone number acts as a proxy for a bank account number .
so instead of paying , for example , the plumber by cheque - he or she could be paid by an exchange of text messages .
in the netherlands , the cheque is no longer used at all .
its use is also rare in belgium , germany , switzerland and sweden .
but it is used much more commonly in the us than in the uk .
security fears when new technology affects banking services , consumers are naturally concerned about security .
cash is coming back because it is easier to control in tough times richard dodd british retail consortium where do we spend our cash ?
the history of payments special report : when the penny drops contactless cards will have a limit of £ 10 for each transaction .
occasionally , cardholders will be asked to enter their pin , as they will for purchases above £ 10 .
no cash-back will be available .
the card provider covers any losses if a card is stolen and the customer reports the loss at the earliest opportunity and does not act negligently .
the providers also say it is impossible to clone and any intercepted data would not work if an attempt was made to use it .
the decline of the cheque has slowed owing to security measures , with some companies ensuring a dual signature on cheques to maintain internal security .
a closer look at apacs forecast for the decline of non-cash payments suggests that the move away from cheques , notes and coins has not been as speedy as they expected .
previous reports by the payments association suggested that non-cash payments would overtake cash transactions as early as 2011 .
now , the prediction is 2015 .
digital money has also been talked about for years and has never quite taken off , according to many experts .
a spokeswoman for apacs said that it would take time for consumers and retailers to migrate to new technology , but the move away from cash was already happening .
