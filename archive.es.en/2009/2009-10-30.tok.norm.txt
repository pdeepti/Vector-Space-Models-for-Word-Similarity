in 2008 , the national tiger conservation authority estimated that there were 1,400 tigers alive - a little over a third of the 3,700 that were alive in 2002 .
it used to be that the loss of habitat was considered to be the most serious threat to wild tigers in india .
however , since the mid-1980s , the poaching of tigers to supply the traditional chinese medicine industry has increased .
tiger bones are thought to have important healing properties .
although the government of india has invested a lot of funds to protect tigers in northern india in particular , it is difficult to prevent poachers .
tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”

in 2008 , the national tiger conservation authority estimated that there were 1,400 tigers alive - a little over a third of the 3,700 that were alive in 2002 .
it used to be that the loss of habitat was considered to be the most serious threat to wild tigers in india .
however , since the mid-1980s , the poaching of tigers to supply the traditional chinese medicine industry has increased .
tiger bones are thought to have important healing properties .
although the government of india has invested a lot of funds to protect tigers in northern india in particular , it is difficult to prevent poachers .
tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”
body parts go for 100 euros upwards on the black market in china .
yet , in india , says wright , “ a dead tiger doesn ’ t have any value .
we know that tiger parts are being smuggled out of india , sometimes through nepal - the destination is always china . ”
there is a superstitious belief in china that the prowess of the tiger will protect a house from fire , thieves or ghosts and people might buy tiger parts for this reason .
but generally the parts are sold for medicinal purposes .
henry johannes greten , the president of the german association of chinese traditional medicine , explains that the “ principal use is to prevent muscle cramps and weakness of the bones and the lower back . ”
“ but there are many drugs that can replace tiger bones , ” he insists .
“ many animal parts are used in the chinese diet and medicine .
the chinese mentality is less stringent in prohibiting the use of these animal parts . "
debate on lifting ban on use of tiger bones but china did sign the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in 1981 , and in 1993 it imposed a ban on the harvesting of tiger bones .
nonetheless , captive tigers continue to be bred .
some tiger breeders , medical practitioners and even officials want the ban on tiger bones to be lifted .
they argue that if organ transplants from dead humans can be used to save other humans , why should tiger parts not be used to cure human diseases ?
critics of tiger poaching , however , argue that wild tigers are at strong risk of extinction .
they have called for stricter controls and tougher law enforcement in both india and china to protect tigers .

talks between india and china to protect endangered tigers failed to make much progress when indian environment minister jairam ramesh went to bejing last month . half of the world ’ s tiger population lives in india .
in 2008 , the national tiger conservation authority estimated that there were 1,400 tigers alive - a little over a third of the 3,700 that were alive in 2002 .
it used to be that the loss of habitat was considered to be the most serious threat to wild tigers in india .
however , since the mid-1980s , the poaching of tigers to supply the traditional chinese medicine industry has increased .
tiger bones are thought to have important healing properties .
although the government of india has invested a lot of funds to protect tigers in northern india in particular , it is difficult to prevent poachers .
tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”
body parts go for 100 euros upwards on the black market in china .
yet , in india , says wright , “ a dead tiger doesn ’ t have any value .
we know that tiger parts are being smuggled out of india , sometimes through nepal - the destination is always china . ”
there is a superstitious belief in china that the prowess of the tiger will protect a house from fire , thieves or ghosts and people might buy tiger parts for this reason .
but generally the parts are sold for medicinal purposes .
henry johannes greten , the president of the german association of chinese traditional medicine , explains that the “ principal use is to prevent muscle cramps and weakness of the bones and the lower back . ”
“ but there are many drugs that can replace tiger bones , ” he insists .
“ many animal parts are used in the chinese diet and medicine .
the chinese mentality is less stringent in prohibiting the use of these animal parts . "
debate on lifting ban on use of tiger bones but china did sign the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in 1981 , and in 1993 it imposed a ban on the harvesting of tiger bones .
nonetheless , captive tigers continue to be bred .
some tiger breeders , medical practitioners and even officials want the ban on tiger bones to be lifted .
they argue that if organ transplants from dead humans can be used to save other humans , why should tiger parts not be used to cure human diseases ?
critics of tiger poaching , however , argue that wild tigers are at strong risk of extinction .
they have called for stricter controls and tougher law enforcement in both india and china to protect tigers .

talks between india and china to protect endangered tigers failed to make much progress when indian environment minister jairam ramesh went to bejing last month . half of the world ’ s tiger population lives in india .
in 2008 , the national tiger conservation authority estimated that there were 1,400 tigers alive - a little over a third of the 3,700 that were alive in 2002 .
it used to be that the loss of habitat was considered to be the most serious threat to wild tigers in india .
however , since the mid-1980s , the poaching of tigers to supply the traditional chinese medicine industry has increased .
tiger bones are thought to have important healing properties .
although the government of india has invested a lot of funds to protect tigers in northern india in particular , it is difficult to prevent poachers .
tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”
body parts go for 100 euros upwards on the black market in china .
yet , in india , says wright , “ a dead tiger doesn ’ t have any value .
we know that tiger parts are being smuggled out of india , sometimes through nepal - the destination is always china . ”
there is a superstitious belief in china that the prowess of the tiger will protect a house from fire , thieves or ghosts and people might buy tiger parts for this reason .
but generally the parts are sold for medicinal purposes .
henry johannes greten , the president of the german association of chinese traditional medicine , explains that the “ principal use is to prevent muscle cramps and weakness of the bones and the lower back . ”
“ but there are many drugs that can replace tiger bones , ” he insists .
“ many animal parts are used in the chinese diet and medicine .
the chinese mentality is less stringent in prohibiting the use of these animal parts . "
debate on lifting ban on use of tiger bones but china did sign the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in 1981 , and in 1993 it imposed a ban on the harvesting of tiger bones .
nonetheless , captive tigers continue to be bred .
some tiger breeders , medical practitioners and even officials want the ban on tiger bones to be lifted .
they argue that if organ transplants from dead humans can be used to save other humans , why should tiger parts not be used to cure human diseases ?
critics of tiger poaching , however , argue that wild tigers are at strong risk of extinction .
they have called for stricter controls and tougher law enforcement in both india and china to protect tigers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de third reich -pipe- 30.10.2009 slow wheels of justice for ' last ' nazi trials this fall großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere , former ss man , does not deny the killings on wednesday , the trial of a former ss man began .
at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.10.2009 dutch music project turns living rooms into live venues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no simulating the thrill of live music your favorite band might just show up at your door very soon .
the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .
so this created a small network but it did n't really work out . "
it was n't until jonkheer relaunched the house concert project in 2002 - this time with the help of the internet - that it really took off .
two sets on a sunday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the second coming of liylr has been aided by the internet anyone can host a living room concert as long as they live in one of the12 dutch and belgian cities currently on the live in your living room tour schedule .
mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .
" the idea was to have an intimate concert without people shouting for beers at the bar and people talking over the music , " jonkheer said .
" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .
for their part , the audience members can get much closer to top musicians than they would be able to in a stadium or hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer-songwriters are keen to appear at living room shows it is unlikely that any megabands - say , the remaining beatles or led zeppelin - will choose a living room as the venue for their next comeback concert , but hosts may still get a well-known dutch or belgian artist turning up to entertain them .
or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .
expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .
“ we did a series of 10 concerts and had a wonderful experience over there , " mulder said .
" doing house concerts , the new island festival , and playing living rooms ... i 'm still in contact with people who attended our concerts and liked the music and also with musicians we played with .
people were so enthusiastic that they are now arranging stuff with record-companies and so on .
i am quite sure that if we would have only done clubs , this would not have happened . ”
as the project goes from country to country , it seems ever more likely that you will soon be able to catch a band in a living room near you in the future - maybe even in your own .

the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .
so this created a small network but it did n't really work out . "
it was n't until jonkheer relaunched the house concert project in 2002 - this time with the help of the internet - that it really took off .
two sets on a sunday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the second coming of liylr has been aided by the internet anyone can host a living room concert as long as they live in one of the12 dutch and belgian cities currently on the live in your living room tour schedule .
mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .
" the idea was to have an intimate concert without people shouting for beers at the bar and people talking over the music , " jonkheer said .
" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .

or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .
expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .

expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .
“ we did a series of 10 concerts and had a wonderful experience over there , " mulder said .
" doing house concerts , the new island festival , and playing living rooms ... i 'm still in contact with people who attended our concerts and liked the music and also with musicians we played with .
people were so enthusiastic that they are now arranging stuff with record-companies and so on .
i am quite sure that if we would have only done clubs , this would not have happened . ”
as the project goes from country to country , it seems ever more likely that you will soon be able to catch a band in a living room near you in the future - maybe even in your own .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.10.2009 dutch music project turns living rooms into live venues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no simulating the thrill of live music your favorite band might just show up at your door very soon .
the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .
so this created a small network but it did n't really work out . "
it was n't until jonkheer relaunched the house concert project in 2002 - this time with the help of the internet - that it really took off .
two sets on a sunday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the second coming of liylr has been aided by the internet anyone can host a living room concert as long as they live in one of the12 dutch and belgian cities currently on the live in your living room tour schedule .
mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .
" the idea was to have an intimate concert without people shouting for beers at the bar and people talking over the music , " jonkheer said .
" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .
for their part , the audience members can get much closer to top musicians than they would be able to in a stadium or hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer-songwriters are keen to appear at living room shows it is unlikely that any megabands - say , the remaining beatles or led zeppelin - will choose a living room as the venue for their next comeback concert , but hosts may still get a well-known dutch or belgian artist turning up to entertain them .
or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .

among the highlights of the cycle were the two concerts given by the dutch pianist ronald brautigam , who is currently working on a complete recording of the beethoven sonatas and is extremely conversant with the tonal possibilities offered by the fortepiano . even in the composer 's three early sonatas -lrb- op .
2 -rrb- , ronald brautigam made it extremely apparent how finely shaded and subtle beethoven 's music sounds on the fortepiano , quickly calling into question cherished listening habits : beethoven played with the richness of sound produced by a modern concert grand .
it was with these pieces that beethoven , who had initially created a sensation in vienna as a pianist and improviser , presented himself in 1795 for the first time as a composer of piano sonatas as well .
he dedicated them to joseph haydn , who had taught him in 1793 and was present at their first performance . even the dramatically forceful " pathetique " sounded unexpectedly transparent and intriguing on the seemingly fragile fortepiano .
listeners familiar with portraits of beethoven thought they saw a certain resemblance between the composer and his interpreter , ronald brautigam . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 1 in f minor op. 2/1 piano sonata no. 2 in a major op. 2/2 piano sonata no. 3 in c major op. 2/3 piano sonata no. 8 in c minor op. 13 , “ pathetique ” performed by : robert brautigam , fortepiano performed on september 23 , 2009 at the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . marita berg / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in eight concerts , six interpreters played all 32 of beethoven 's piano sonatas the first concert in the series was given by andrea lucchesini in the beethoven-haus in bonn .
the italian pianist is not among the fortepiano specialists in the historical performance scene .
for his concert , he played both on a fortepiano - a copy of an instrument built in 1824 by the piano maker conrad graf - and a steinway grand .
the latter was not used for beethoven 's music , but for a piano sonata by the composer luciano berio , who died six years ago ; lucchesini premiered the piece in zurich in 2001 . with and without the fortepiano : historical and modern instruments in this concert , two different worlds of piano sound confronted each other to great effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.10.2009 angela merkel : from shy physicist to two-term chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel shares a laugh with her new vice chancellor , guido westerwelle elected for a second term at the helm of europe 's largest economy , angela merkel is regarded by voters as a steady hand in a time of crisis and a formidable presence on the world stage . the election night of september 27th was a good one for angela merkel .
once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .

" we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .

at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .
both of these men are in their late 80s , which raises the question of why they were not brought to justice earlier .
boere lived openly in western germany for decades .
demjanjuk had us citizenship for years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk maintains his innocence the cases illustrate how difficult it can be to prosecute crimes from this era , as the accused and witnesses alike die and evidence becomes harder to come by .
legal statutes from different countries and periods can also gum up the wheels of justice .
to many , the fact that the two men are answering for their crimes more than 60 years after the fact is an example of a legal system that is not able , or perhaps even willing , to bring all the perpetrators to justice .
in the period from 1945 to 2005 , there have been 4,964 trials regarding nazi crimes .
in many people 's eyes , that number is too low .
is justice possible ?
in fact , political philosopher hannah arendt said the crimes committed by the nazis had shattered the very foundations of justice in the western world and it was necessary to rethink what it meant to judge crime and criminality .
but edith raim , a historian at the institute for contemporary history in munich , said despite the frustration felt by many at the slow , or inadequate , wheels of justice , the german judiciary has been fairly relentless in its pursuit of nazi perpetrators .
" it 's impressive that the german justice system has been so active in this area for such a long time , even sometimes against public opinion , " she said .
" while today the public is very interested in these trials , that was n't always the case .
in the 50s , people did n't want anything to do with them , but the judiciary went ahead with prosecutions . "
german prosecutors have conducted investigations of nazi crimes every year since 1945 , unlike in other countries .
austria 's last big nazi trial took place in the mid-70s .
the us stopped its trials in 1948 , britain one year later .
nuremberg 's legacy it was the trials just after world war two , however , which garnered the most international attention and left a mark that is still being felt in jurisprudence today .
the nuremberg trials of top nazi officials , including hermann goering , captivated the world , detailing as they did the unprecedented crimes of the nazi regime .
but legal experts agree that the trials also laid a new foundation for international law , allowing for the first time a court to directly charge and punish an individual based on international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg trials broke new ground in the field of international law " up to that point , people had believed a national penal law was needed .
nuremberg put an end to that , saying that some deeds were so horrible that the international community had to directly intervene , " said christian tomuschat , a law professor at berlin 's humboldt university .
the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .
" the many hundred thousands of victims who were n't able to have a life often are forgotten , " she said .
" i think these trials can serve as a reminder of the immeasurable suffering these victims and their loved ones endured . "

among the highlights of the cycle were the two concerts given by the dutch pianist ronald brautigam , who is currently working on a complete recording of the beethoven sonatas and is extremely conversant with the tonal possibilities offered by the fortepiano . even in the composer 's three early sonatas -lrb- op .
2 -rrb- , ronald brautigam made it extremely apparent how finely shaded and subtle beethoven 's music sounds on the fortepiano , quickly calling into question cherished listening habits : beethoven played with the richness of sound produced by a modern concert grand .
it was with these pieces that beethoven , who had initially created a sensation in vienna as a pianist and improviser , presented himself in 1795 for the first time as a composer of piano sonatas as well .
he dedicated them to joseph haydn , who had taught him in 1793 and was present at their first performance . even the dramatically forceful " pathetique " sounded unexpectedly transparent and intriguing on the seemingly fragile fortepiano .
listeners familiar with portraits of beethoven thought they saw a certain resemblance between the composer and his interpreter , ronald brautigam . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 1 in f minor op. 2/1 piano sonata no. 2 in a major op. 2/2 piano sonata no. 3 in c major op. 2/3 piano sonata no. 8 in c minor op. 13 , “ pathetique ” performed by : robert brautigam , fortepiano performed on september 23 , 2009 at the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . marita berg / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

talks between india and china to protect endangered tigers failed to make much progress when indian environment minister jairam ramesh went to bejing last month . half of the world ’ s tiger population lives in india .
in 2008 , the national tiger conservation authority estimated that there were 1,400 tigers alive - a little over a third of the 3,700 that were alive in 2002 .
it used to be that the loss of habitat was considered to be the most serious threat to wild tigers in india .
however , since the mid-1980s , the poaching of tigers to supply the traditional chinese medicine industry has increased .
tiger bones are thought to have important healing properties .
although the government of india has invested a lot of funds to protect tigers in northern india in particular , it is difficult to prevent poachers .
tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”
body parts go for 100 euros upwards on the black market in china .
yet , in india , says wright , “ a dead tiger doesn ’ t have any value .
we know that tiger parts are being smuggled out of india , sometimes through nepal - the destination is always china . ”
there is a superstitious belief in china that the prowess of the tiger will protect a house from fire , thieves or ghosts and people might buy tiger parts for this reason .
but generally the parts are sold for medicinal purposes .
henry johannes greten , the president of the german association of chinese traditional medicine , explains that the “ principal use is to prevent muscle cramps and weakness of the bones and the lower back . ”
“ but there are many drugs that can replace tiger bones , ” he insists .
“ many animal parts are used in the chinese diet and medicine .
the chinese mentality is less stringent in prohibiting the use of these animal parts . "
debate on lifting ban on use of tiger bones but china did sign the convention on international trade in endangered species of wild fauna and flora in 1981 , and in 1993 it imposed a ban on the harvesting of tiger bones .
nonetheless , captive tigers continue to be bred .
some tiger breeders , medical practitioners and even officials want the ban on tiger bones to be lifted .
they argue that if organ transplants from dead humans can be used to save other humans , why should tiger parts not be used to cure human diseases ?
critics of tiger poaching , however , argue that wild tigers are at strong risk of extinction .
they have called for stricter controls and tougher law enforcement in both india and china to protect tigers .

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .
it was given its first performance in 1985 in the bolshoi theater in moscow . the 36-year-old tran manh hung is among the most successful composers of his generation .
as a commission for deutsche welle , he wrote the work " le chi vien " for violin and orchestra , a " poem symphony . " the work tells the tragic story of the national hero nguyen trai , who , though innocent , was executed for regicide in 1442 together with his family .
twenty years later , nguyen was rehabilitated - but not his wife , nguyen thi lo .
violinist bui cong duy drew a picture of the beautiful thi lo with a tender , lyrical tone - perhaps a belated musical homage after nearly 600 years . program : ludwig van beethoven overture to heinrich joseph von collin ´ s “ coriolanus ” tragedy in c minor op .

tiger skin and bones are very valuable belinda wright , the executive director of the wildlife protection society of india , says that “ poaching is widespread in india because of the value of tiger skin , bones and other body parts . ”

opposition and non-government circles have reacted with alarm . niebel told a german newspaper that economic powers like china and india , commonly referred to as " developing nations , " no longer met the criteria of that distinction .
" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .
niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .
the combination of the two ministries , the party said , would establish a german foreign policy with " one voice . "
meanwhile , the opposition has reacted with alarm to the fdp being at the head of the development ministry .
social democrat spokesman sascha rabbe called niebel 's appointment as development minister a " bad joke . "
" it 's nothing short of ridiculous that the people who were trying to dissolve the development ministry have now put one of their own at the head of it .
it looks now like niebel will turn the development ministry into a liquidation ministry , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are perplexed at the naming of niebel as development minister broken promises ?
criticism also come from development groups .
claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .
it says , on the contrary , that it is looking for ways to step up the fight against global poverty. glb / ips / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teun de groot , the son of one of boere 's victims , was at the court the judge ruled that the case can not continue until maass gives a clear response to the accusations .
maass did not have a response ready but said he would prepare one by monday when the case resumes .
sheltered from justice although wednesday 's decision is a setback for the prosecution , bringing boere to court at all represents a victory in itself .
in 2008 , several german courts ruled that boere could not stand trial in germany because of his advanced age .
maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .

critics say it does not tackle the country 's soaring budget deficit . german president horst koehler swore in angela merkel on wednesday after she was formally elected chancellor by the lower house of parliament .
her new cabinet was also sworn in . " i accept the result and thank you for your trust , " merkel said as lawmakers applauded in the main chamber of the reichstag parliament building .
the majority of german mps voted for merkel , as she received 323 ' yes ' votes out of 622 .
while the vote is secret , calculations show that apparently nine parliamentarians from merkel 's own coalition withheld their support .
merkel , 55 , whose christian democrats emerged as the strongest party following the general election on september 27 , enters her second term with a new coalition between her conservatives and the pro-business free democrats .
tackling the economy as criticism mounts over merkel 's economic plan , president koehler warned the chancellor against " unrealistic growth hopes " and said germany must reduce its debt levels .
merkel 's coalition announced a policy program last week which includes 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- in tax cuts ; though it is not entirely clear how the government plans to finance them .
political opponents say she needs to do more to reduce germany 's enormous debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy supports merkel 's tax cuts luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , chairman of the 16-nation eurozone , said that germany 's debt level was " excessive and scarcely bearable for the next generation . "
so far , merkel has not committed herself to making any unpopular spending cuts , and has maintained that cutting taxes will help germany 's economy recover . french president nicolas sarkozy praised merkel 's tax-cutting plan as he hosted her in paris on wednesday evening .
" your choice of growth by lowering taxes is a very useful choice for europe , " sarkozy told reporters at his elysee palace before dinner with merkel .
" the composition and the program of your coalition government are good news for france . "
during the meeting , merkel also agreed to come to paris on november 11 for armistice day to commemorate those who lost their lives in the two world wars .
she is to be the first german leader to attend the ceremony. vj / jam / ap / reuters / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but now businesses are realizing there 's a lot of money to be made catering to the growing muslim population . it is just after working hours , and customers are slowly rolling into the uemit turkish supermarket in bonn .
the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food chains in europe are increasingly serving up halal products to cater to muslims " i think the business will go on and it 's a big trend , " she says .
" we saw how many people came to the halal stands at the anuga food trade fair to get information about it . "
" they were not all muslims - there were people from all over the world , from pakistanis to chinese people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 30.10.2009 halal food market on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany say it is still difficult to find halal products in most grocery stores muslims in europe have long struggled to find halal food products , which abide by islamic law .
but now businesses are realizing there 's a lot of money to be made catering to the growing muslim population . it is just after working hours , and customers are slowly rolling into the uemit turkish supermarket in bonn .
the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .

he had loaned the party hundreds of thousands of euros over the last few years . rieger suffered a stroke last weekend , and died on thursday at a berlin hospital .
he was 63 .
the hamburg lawyer was vice president of the far-right , anti-immigrant national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the chairman of its hamburg branch .
rieger 's family , which did not share his views , told germany 's dpa news agency that they were considering burial at sea or cremation and then scattering the ashes to prevent his grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for the extreme right .
rieger 's son harald said they were planning a private funeral .
rieger was known for having many contacts within the neo-nazi scene and with leading extreme rightists in scandinavia .
he also defended several high-ranking extremists in court .
" he was a neo-nazi without any question , " olaf sundermeyer , a journalist and npd expert , told deutsche welle .
" juergen rieger was one of the best known representatives of this hooligan front , this neo-nazi front of the national democratic party of germany . "
sundermeyer said his death would have a serious impact on the day-to-day operations of the party .
" he was the only person that actually had money within the npd .
he owned a lot of property in the hamburg area , and he gave loans to the npd .
the question is whether his four children demand to get this money back , " sundermeyer said .
an inheritance of debt ?
the party has been plagued with financial problems in recent years .
the npd had to pay back 1.27 million euros -lrb- $ 1.89 million -rrb- in public campaign funds to the german government after a former treasurer was charged with embezzling over 700,000 euros in 2008 .
the head of the hamburg office for the protection of the constitution , heino vahldieck , called reiger 's death a significant blow for the npd and far-right organizations in germany .
" he was for a long time a beacon -as much for his biography as for his financial contributions , " vahldieck told the associated press .
according to dpa , rieger leaves behind an estimated fortune of 500,000 euros .
it 's not yet known if rieger left any money to the party in his will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger had many contacts within the militant neo-nazi wing of the npd who 's next ?
sundermeyer says that rieger 's death could set off a power-struggle within the npd , between the militant neo-nazis and those in the party who play down its connections to the hitler-era .
" now that he 's dead , the big question will be which of these wings will dominate the npd in the future , " sundermeyer said .
in recent years , rieger had been trying to buy derelict hotels , guest houses , and cinemas for use as " training centers " for the far-right .
his attempts set off a flurry of citizen protests and counter-offers from the municipal governments .
hans-werner schlitte , the mayor of a town where rieger was trying to buy an empty country hotel , said on friday that the community felt not so strongly under pressure since his death .

the country remains deeply divided over the issue . the government has put forward two proposals to address the matter - the first would see assisted suicide banned altogether , while the second , and most likely to be approved , would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf argued in favor of an individual 's right to choose the moment of their death .
" we do n't want a total ban , " she said , " but we do want to limit the current practice .
we do n't want to be a country with a reputation for suicide tourism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.10.2009 eu countries strike groundbreaking climate deal but skimp on details großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they know which way the climate wind is blowing the agreement marks a breakthrough in eu efforts to lead the fight in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world , but questions remain on how the bill will be shared among the 27 member states . european union leaders meeting in brussels have reached a breakthrough compromise on climate control , strengthening their position ahead of a global summit on climate change to be held in copenhagen in december .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
lisbon treaty gets a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty remains in the czech republic the brussels summit also bore good news for the lisbon reform treaty when members agreed to an opt-out for the czech republic on a human rights charter .
czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .
a decision on who will get the new post was put off until another meeting .
the last remaining hurdle lies with the czech constitutional court , which is scheduled to rule on a legal challenge to the treaty next tuesday. acb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
lisbon treaty gets a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty remains in the czech republic the brussels summit also bore good news for the lisbon reform treaty when members agreed to an opt-out for the czech republic on a human rights charter .
czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .
a decision on who will get the new post was put off until another meeting .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 30.10.2009 the charm of budapest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budapest is famous for its beautiful architecture and historic attractions budapest is one of europe 's most beautiful cities with stunning architecture and wonderful views across the river danube .
it 's a captivating city as dw correspondent arpad szoczi knows very well . i first got to know hungary and hungarians from thousands of kilometers away , growing up in toronto , canada .
i was listening to the stories of my father , a hungarian political refugee who escaped from his home country in 1952 .
then later in life i became a hungarian and eventually bought a home in budapest .
living part of my life now in the hungarian capital , i see that some of the tumultuous times my father described to me still exist .
fortunately , other things make up for it .
i 'll never forget covering a wild anti-government demonstration as a reporter in budapest in october of 2006 .
hundreds of rioters had stormed the main public broadcaster 's tv building , and then later had closed down and barricaded one of the main bridges connecting buda and pest .
as for me , i had to go to an eye clinic because i had developed an outrageous eye infection after being tear-gassed so much .
bildunterschrift : arpad szoczi feels right at home in his ancestral city the political climate remains vitriolic today .
fortunately , none of that can change what i love the most – the city .
for me , there is nothing in this world that equals being on the banks of the danube river between buda and pest on a boat-restaurant on a beautiful summer evening sipping a glass of tokaji and reveling in the surroundings .
and i can safely say that about the hungarian capital after having been to four continents … i still revel in the city 's amazing architecture that is especially apparent on classy andrassy street with its addictive coffee houses .
and you can get a quick history lesson of the country by simply going to heroes ' square .
as one romanian tourist surveying the area once told me , " you can see here that they used to rule an empire . "
getting around budapest via the subway is the best way to go to avoid the constant budapest traffic jams .
the joke in the hilly half of the capital – buda – is that the moment any drops of rain fall , traffic there grinds to a halt .
sometimes , if i want to escape the hustle-and-bustle , i go to the wonderful oasis right on the danube called margaret island .
i usually go for a swim in the huge public pool there , but sometimes just a nice walk will do the trick .
before i know it , it 's already nightfall .
and that 's when i can appreciate the unusual talent that hungarians have – they are incredibly musical .
that 's partly because music is a compulsory subject in schools for much longer than in other countries .
everyone seems to be able to play something .
so , i try whenever i can to check out a hungarian concert – be it pop or classical .
and now looking back on my own life , i understand why my father still pined half-a-century later for his homeland .

it 's a captivating city as dw correspondent arpad szoczi knows very well . i first got to know hungary and hungarians from thousands of kilometers away , growing up in toronto , canada .
i was listening to the stories of my father , a hungarian political refugee who escaped from his home country in 1952 .
then later in life i became a hungarian and eventually bought a home in budapest .
living part of my life now in the hungarian capital , i see that some of the tumultuous times my father described to me still exist .
fortunately , other things make up for it .
i 'll never forget covering a wild anti-government demonstration as a reporter in budapest in october of 2006 .
hundreds of rioters had stormed the main public broadcaster 's tv building , and then later had closed down and barricaded one of the main bridges connecting buda and pest .
as for me , i had to go to an eye clinic because i had developed an outrageous eye infection after being tear-gassed so much .
bildunterschrift : arpad szoczi feels right at home in his ancestral city the political climate remains vitriolic today .
fortunately , none of that can change what i love the most – the city .
for me , there is nothing in this world that equals being on the banks of the danube river between buda and pest on a boat-restaurant on a beautiful summer evening sipping a glass of tokaji and reveling in the surroundings .
and i can safely say that about the hungarian capital after having been to four continents … i still revel in the city 's amazing architecture that is especially apparent on classy andrassy street with its addictive coffee houses .
and you can get a quick history lesson of the country by simply going to heroes ' square .
as one romanian tourist surveying the area once told me , " you can see here that they used to rule an empire . "
getting around budapest via the subway is the best way to go to avoid the constant budapest traffic jams .
the joke in the hilly half of the capital – buda – is that the moment any drops of rain fall , traffic there grinds to a halt .
sometimes , if i want to escape the hustle-and-bustle , i go to the wonderful oasis right on the danube called margaret island .
i usually go for a swim in the huge public pool there , but sometimes just a nice walk will do the trick .
before i know it , it 's already nightfall .
and that 's when i can appreciate the unusual talent that hungarians have – they are incredibly musical .
that 's partly because music is a compulsory subject in schools for much longer than in other countries .
everyone seems to be able to play something .
so , i try whenever i can to check out a hungarian concert – be it pop or classical .
and now looking back on my own life , i understand why my father still pined half-a-century later for his homeland .

opposition and non-government circles have reacted with alarm . niebel told a german newspaper that economic powers like china and india , commonly referred to as " developing nations , " no longer met the criteria of that distinction .
" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .
niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .
the combination of the two ministries , the party said , would establish a german foreign policy with " one voice . "
meanwhile , the opposition has reacted with alarm to the fdp being at the head of the development ministry .
social democrat spokesman sascha rabbe called niebel 's appointment as development minister a " bad joke . "
" it 's nothing short of ridiculous that the people who were trying to dissolve the development ministry have now put one of their own at the head of it .
it looks now like niebel will turn the development ministry into a liquidation ministry , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are perplexed at the naming of niebel as development minister broken promises ?
criticism also come from development groups .
claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .

opposition and non-government circles have reacted with alarm . niebel told a german newspaper that economic powers like china and india , commonly referred to as " developing nations , " no longer met the criteria of that distinction .
" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .
niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .

claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .

in eight concerts , six interpreters played all 32 of beethoven 's piano sonatas the first concert in the series was given by andrea lucchesini in the beethoven-haus in bonn .
the italian pianist is not among the fortepiano specialists in the historical performance scene .
for his concert , he played both on a fortepiano - a copy of an instrument built in 1824 by the piano maker conrad graf - and a steinway grand .
the latter was not used for beethoven 's music , but for a piano sonata by the composer luciano berio , who died six years ago ; lucchesini premiered the piece in zurich in 2001 . with and without the fortepiano : historical and modern instruments in this concert , two different worlds of piano sound confronted each other to great effect .
in the sonata in f-sharp major , op. 78 , lucchesini made the fortepiano sing with his tender , expressive playing .
the conductor hans von buelow said once of the four-bar adagio introduction to this piece : " if beethoven had written nothing else but these four bars , he would be immortal . " the change to the steinway grand for berio 's piano sonata came almost as a shock .
new tone colors and sounds filled the room , and the volume and explosive dynamics of the modern grand piano seemed to overshadow the intimacy of the fortepiano .
but this intimacy returned with beethoven 's " hammerklavier " sonata , the most radical and innovative work of the sonata cycle at the time of its composition .
when beethoven , by this time almost completely deaf , composed it in 1817/18 , he told his pupil carl czerny : " i am writing a sonata that is to be my greatest . "
many pianists still stand in fear of the final movement , in which beethoven shows no consideration for the fact that a pianist has only two hands to cope with its technical demands . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 24 in f-sharp minor op. 78 piano sonata no. 29 in b-flat major op. 106 -lrb- " hammerklavier sonata " -rrb- luciano berio piano sonata performed by : andrea lucchesini -lrb- piano , fortepiano -rrb- performed on september 14 , 2009 in the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . norbert hornig / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time , a keyboard instrument became capable of being played not just loudly or softly , but with a wide range of dynamic nuances .
beethoven used this as an opportunity to experiment with new expressive possibilities on the piano .

he had loaned the party hundreds of thousands of euros over the last few years . rieger suffered a stroke last weekend , and died on thursday at a berlin hospital .
he was 63 .
the hamburg lawyer was vice president of the far-right , anti-immigrant national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the chairman of its hamburg branch .
rieger 's family , which did not share his views , told germany 's dpa news agency that they were considering burial at sea or cremation and then scattering the ashes to prevent his grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for the extreme right .
rieger 's son harald said they were planning a private funeral .
rieger was known for having many contacts within the neo-nazi scene and with leading extreme rightists in scandinavia .
he also defended several high-ranking extremists in court .
" he was a neo-nazi without any question , " olaf sundermeyer , a journalist and npd expert , told deutsche welle .
" juergen rieger was one of the best known representatives of this hooligan front , this neo-nazi front of the national democratic party of germany . "
sundermeyer said his death would have a serious impact on the day-to-day operations of the party .
" he was the only person that actually had money within the npd .
he owned a lot of property in the hamburg area , and he gave loans to the npd .
the question is whether his four children demand to get this money back , " sundermeyer said .
an inheritance of debt ?
the party has been plagued with financial problems in recent years .
the npd had to pay back 1.27 million euros -lrb- $ 1.89 million -rrb- in public campaign funds to the german government after a former treasurer was charged with embezzling over 700,000 euros in 2008 .
the head of the hamburg office for the protection of the constitution , heino vahldieck , called reiger 's death a significant blow for the npd and far-right organizations in germany .
" he was for a long time a beacon -as much for his biography as for his financial contributions , " vahldieck told the associated press .
according to dpa , rieger leaves behind an estimated fortune of 500,000 euros .
it 's not yet known if rieger left any money to the party in his will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger had many contacts within the militant neo-nazi wing of the npd who 's next ?
sundermeyer says that rieger 's death could set off a power-struggle within the npd , between the militant neo-nazis and those in the party who play down its connections to the hitler-era .
" now that he 's dead , the big question will be which of these wings will dominate the npd in the future , " sundermeyer said .
in recent years , rieger had been trying to buy derelict hotels , guest houses , and cinemas for use as " training centers " for the far-right .
his attempts set off a flurry of citizen protests and counter-offers from the municipal governments .
hans-werner schlitte , the mayor of a town where rieger was trying to buy an empty country hotel , said on friday that the community felt not so strongly under pressure since his death .

he had loaned the party hundreds of thousands of euros over the last few years . rieger suffered a stroke last weekend , and died on thursday at a berlin hospital .
he was 63 .
the hamburg lawyer was vice president of the far-right , anti-immigrant national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the chairman of its hamburg branch .
rieger 's family , which did not share his views , told germany 's dpa news agency that they were considering burial at sea or cremation and then scattering the ashes to prevent his grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for the extreme right .
rieger 's son harald said they were planning a private funeral .
rieger was known for having many contacts within the neo-nazi scene and with leading extreme rightists in scandinavia .
he also defended several high-ranking extremists in court .
" he was a neo-nazi without any question , " olaf sundermeyer , a journalist and npd expert , told deutsche welle .
" juergen rieger was one of the best known representatives of this hooligan front , this neo-nazi front of the national democratic party of germany . "
sundermeyer said his death would have a serious impact on the day-to-day operations of the party .
" he was the only person that actually had money within the npd .
he owned a lot of property in the hamburg area , and he gave loans to the npd .
the question is whether his four children demand to get this money back , " sundermeyer said .
an inheritance of debt ?
the party has been plagued with financial problems in recent years .
the npd had to pay back 1.27 million euros -lrb- $ 1.89 million -rrb- in public campaign funds to the german government after a former treasurer was charged with embezzling over 700,000 euros in 2008 .
the head of the hamburg office for the protection of the constitution , heino vahldieck , called reiger 's death a significant blow for the npd and far-right organizations in germany .
" he was for a long time a beacon -as much for his biography as for his financial contributions , " vahldieck told the associated press .
according to dpa , rieger leaves behind an estimated fortune of 500,000 euros .
it 's not yet known if rieger left any money to the party in his will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger had many contacts within the militant neo-nazi wing of the npd who 's next ?
sundermeyer says that rieger 's death could set off a power-struggle within the npd , between the militant neo-nazis and those in the party who play down its connections to the hitler-era .
" now that he 's dead , the big question will be which of these wings will dominate the npd in the future , " sundermeyer said .
in recent years , rieger had been trying to buy derelict hotels , guest houses , and cinemas for use as " training centers " for the far-right .
his attempts set off a flurry of citizen protests and counter-offers from the municipal governments .
hans-werner schlitte , the mayor of a town where rieger was trying to buy an empty country hotel , said on friday that the community felt not so strongly under pressure since his death .

on wednesday , the bundestag is to meet to re-elect merkel as chancellor . lammert used the first speech of his second term as bundestag president to call for a host of improvements to the parliament 's protocol , as well as a one-year extension to the legislative period .
lammert pointed to statistics suggesting that german voters felt they had too many elections , and suggested holding general elections every five years , rather than every four .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert called for reforms in his inaugural speech lammert , who was re-elected for this term with a slightly reduced majority of 84.6 percent , also called on representatives not to saddle the parliament with unnecessary work , and " self-critically check " the resolutions and initiatives they planned . he encouraged parliamentarians to be more self-confident .
" the bundestag is not a support-organ , but the heart of the formation of our country 's political will , " he told representatives .
spd relegated to the back the seating arrangements in the new parliament did offer a startling image of how german politics changed in the september 27 vote .
merkel 's grand coalition partners in the last government , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , were devastated by the election , seeing their representation in the bundestag drop from 221 deputies to 146 .
this has forced the spd to give up two of its highly-prized front row seats in the bundestag , and leading figures in the grand coalition government , like former finance minister peer steinbrueck , have now been relegated to the distant back rows .
on wednesday , lammert is to chair a meeting in which the bundestag is to re-elect chancellor merkel at the head of new coalition government made up of her christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . bk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .

czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .

european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
lisbon treaty gets a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty remains in the czech republic the brussels summit also bore good news for the lisbon reform treaty when members agreed to an opt-out for the czech republic on a human rights charter .
czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .
a decision on who will get the new post was put off until another meeting .
the last remaining hurdle lies with the czech constitutional court , which is scheduled to rule on a legal challenge to the treaty next tuesday. acb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.10.2009 angela merkel : from shy physicist to two-term chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel shares a laugh with her new vice chancellor , guido westerwelle elected for a second term at the helm of europe 's largest economy , angela merkel is regarded by voters as a steady hand in a time of crisis and a formidable presence on the world stage . the election night of september 27th was a good one for angela merkel .
once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .

once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 30.10.2009 angela merkel : from shy physicist to two-term chancellor großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel shares a laugh with her new vice chancellor , guido westerwelle elected for a second term at the helm of europe 's largest economy , angela merkel is regarded by voters as a steady hand in a time of crisis and a formidable presence on the world stage . the election night of september 27th was a good one for angela merkel .
once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .
this " girl " has become , according to forbes magazine , the most powerful woman on the planet . author : kyle james editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .
both of these men are in their late 80s , which raises the question of why they were not brought to justice earlier .
boere lived openly in western germany for decades .
demjanjuk had us citizenship for years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk maintains his innocence the cases illustrate how difficult it can be to prosecute crimes from this era , as the accused and witnesses alike die and evidence becomes harder to come by .
legal statutes from different countries and periods can also gum up the wheels of justice .
to many , the fact that the two men are answering for their crimes more than 60 years after the fact is an example of a legal system that is not able , or perhaps even willing , to bring all the perpetrators to justice .
in the period from 1945 to 2005 , there have been 4,964 trials regarding nazi crimes .
in many people 's eyes , that number is too low .
is justice possible ?
in fact , political philosopher hannah arendt said the crimes committed by the nazis had shattered the very foundations of justice in the western world and it was necessary to rethink what it meant to judge crime and criminality .
but edith raim , a historian at the institute for contemporary history in munich , said despite the frustration felt by many at the slow , or inadequate , wheels of justice , the german judiciary has been fairly relentless in its pursuit of nazi perpetrators .
" it 's impressive that the german justice system has been so active in this area for such a long time , even sometimes against public opinion , " she said .
" while today the public is very interested in these trials , that was n't always the case .
in the 50s , people did n't want anything to do with them , but the judiciary went ahead with prosecutions . "
german prosecutors have conducted investigations of nazi crimes every year since 1945 , unlike in other countries .
austria 's last big nazi trial took place in the mid-70s .
the us stopped its trials in 1948 , britain one year later .
nuremberg 's legacy it was the trials just after world war two , however , which garnered the most international attention and left a mark that is still being felt in jurisprudence today .
the nuremberg trials of top nazi officials , including hermann goering , captivated the world , detailing as they did the unprecedented crimes of the nazi regime .
but legal experts agree that the trials also laid a new foundation for international law , allowing for the first time a court to directly charge and punish an individual based on international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg trials broke new ground in the field of international law " up to that point , people had believed a national penal law was needed .
nuremberg put an end to that , saying that some deeds were so horrible that the international community had to directly intervene , " said christian tomuschat , a law professor at berlin 's humboldt university .
the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .
" the many hundred thousands of victims who were n't able to have a life often are forgotten , " she said .
" i think these trials can serve as a reminder of the immeasurable suffering these victims and their loved ones endured . "

the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .

justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .

the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .

it 's a captivating city as dw correspondent arpad szoczi knows very well . i first got to know hungary and hungarians from thousands of kilometers away , growing up in toronto , canada .
i was listening to the stories of my father , a hungarian political refugee who escaped from his home country in 1952 .
then later in life i became a hungarian and eventually bought a home in budapest .
living part of my life now in the hungarian capital , i see that some of the tumultuous times my father described to me still exist .
fortunately , other things make up for it .
i 'll never forget covering a wild anti-government demonstration as a reporter in budapest in october of 2006 .
hundreds of rioters had stormed the main public broadcaster 's tv building , and then later had closed down and barricaded one of the main bridges connecting buda and pest .
as for me , i had to go to an eye clinic because i had developed an outrageous eye infection after being tear-gassed so much .
bildunterschrift : arpad szoczi feels right at home in his ancestral city the political climate remains vitriolic today .
fortunately , none of that can change what i love the most – the city .
for me , there is nothing in this world that equals being on the banks of the danube river between buda and pest on a boat-restaurant on a beautiful summer evening sipping a glass of tokaji and reveling in the surroundings .
and i can safely say that about the hungarian capital after having been to four continents … i still revel in the city 's amazing architecture that is especially apparent on classy andrassy street with its addictive coffee houses .
and you can get a quick history lesson of the country by simply going to heroes ' square .
as one romanian tourist surveying the area once told me , " you can see here that they used to rule an empire . "
getting around budapest via the subway is the best way to go to avoid the constant budapest traffic jams .
the joke in the hilly half of the capital – buda – is that the moment any drops of rain fall , traffic there grinds to a halt .
sometimes , if i want to escape the hustle-and-bustle , i go to the wonderful oasis right on the danube called margaret island .
i usually go for a swim in the huge public pool there , but sometimes just a nice walk will do the trick .
before i know it , it 's already nightfall .
and that 's when i can appreciate the unusual talent that hungarians have – they are incredibly musical .
that 's partly because music is a compulsory subject in schools for much longer than in other countries .
everyone seems to be able to play something .
so , i try whenever i can to check out a hungarian concert – be it pop or classical .
and now looking back on my own life , i understand why my father still pined half-a-century later for his homeland .

niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .
the combination of the two ministries , the party said , would establish a german foreign policy with " one voice . "
meanwhile , the opposition has reacted with alarm to the fdp being at the head of the development ministry .
social democrat spokesman sascha rabbe called niebel 's appointment as development minister a " bad joke . "
" it 's nothing short of ridiculous that the people who were trying to dissolve the development ministry have now put one of their own at the head of it .
it looks now like niebel will turn the development ministry into a liquidation ministry , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are perplexed at the naming of niebel as development minister broken promises ?
criticism also come from development groups .
claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .
it says , on the contrary , that it is looking for ways to step up the fight against global poverty. glb / ips / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

helmut k. reportedly misstated the assets of his k1 hedge fund in order to obtain loans from banks .
media estimates say losses could be as high as 200 million euros -lrb- $ 294 million -rrb- .
" this is a major inquiry , " senior prosecutor dietrich geuder told the dpa news agency thursday .
helmut k. , founder of the k1 hedge fund group , is being investigated for allegedly engaging in fraud and breach of trust .
living large helmut k. , whose last name is being withheld in accordance with german privacy guidelines , is a psychologist who formerly sold ads for the german yellow pages before entering the financial sector .
reportedly extremely wealthy , helmut k. lives in an exclusive neighborhood of aschaffenburg , near frankfurt .
a spokeswoman for the munich law firm lutz libbertz said helmut k. 's lawyers would appeal his arrest .
" the man has two children and is married .
he had a private audience with the pope this year and has a 60-million-euro jet at frankfurt airport .
this man is not insignificant , " the spokeswoman told reuters .
the firm reportedly had nearly $ 1 billion under management , the trade publication hedgeweek reported in february .
hedge firm under scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany has called for more regulation of hedge funds this is not helmut k. 's first run-in with the law .
germany 's financial watchdog , bafin , accused the founder of k1 of administering investments without authorization in 2001 .
bafin reportedly launched previous investigations as well , according to bloomberg .
“ it 's absolutely embarrassing that this happens in germany , which has always wanted to be tough on hedge funds , ” jacob schmidt , founder of schmidt research partners ltd . , a london- based hedge fund advisory firm , told bloomberg .
at a summit of world leaders in 2007 , germany proposed stricter controls on the $ 1.4 trillion hedge fund industry .
while leaders did not act at that time , several high-profile hedge fund scandals have increased calls for tighter regulation .
international probe some of helmut k. 's funds were registered in the british virgin islands , a tiny territory in the caribbean .
it appears that the probe has extended beyond germany .
two german nationals were arrested in the united states on thursday .
the miami herald newspaper , quoting unnamed sources , said the us arrests were connected to the k1 investigation .
bloomberg said an unnamed source had also confirmed the involvement of at least one of the men in the k1 fund .
the germans were reportedly caught in a sting by us law enforcement and tax agents .
the men allegedly agreed to set up an off-shore company and foreign bank account for an undercover agent. th / reuters / dpa / ap editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the country remains deeply divided over the issue . the government has put forward two proposals to address the matter - the first would see assisted suicide banned altogether , while the second , and most likely to be approved , would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf argued in favor of an individual 's right to choose the moment of their death .
" we do n't want a total ban , " she said , " but we do want to limit the current practice .
we do n't want to be a country with a reputation for suicide tourism . "
she said that in order for an assisted suicide organization to avoid prosecution it would have to require that a patient obtained testimony from two doctors , and had expressed a wish to die over a long period of time .
schlumpf ruled out the practice of foreigners arriving in switzerland and dying within days .
quick deaths in recent years , dozens of people have travelled to switzerland to use the services of dignitas , a leading assisted suicide organization in the alpine nation .
many came from germany and britain , where assisted suicide remains illegal .
dignitas has now come under scrutiny in switzerland because of its policy of assisting those who are not terminally ill , and for the alleged speed with which the organization deals with its patients .
dignitas treats primarily foreign patients who typically arrive in switzerland , see one dignitas doctor and then die within hours .
the proposal that assisted suicide should be limited only to the terminally ill has angered another organization , exit , whose president , hans wehrli , said that denying assisted suicide to the chronically ill would be going too far .
" a third of our patients are not terminally ill , but they are really suffering , and they want to die , " he said .
" the government has put them in the position where they would have to shoot themselves or jump in front of a train .
" the government says these proposals safeguard dignity in death and the right to choose , but they do n't .
this is n't dignity , it 's cruelty , " wehrli added .
both proposals are now open for public debate before going to switzerland 's parliament next march .
exit and dignitas have said they would , if necessary , push for a nationwide vote on the issue of exactly how far the limits on assisted suicide should go .

boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teun de groot , the son of one of boere 's victims , was at the court the judge ruled that the case can not continue until maass gives a clear response to the accusations .
maass did not have a response ready but said he would prepare one by monday when the case resumes .
sheltered from justice although wednesday 's decision is a setback for the prosecution , bringing boere to court at all represents a victory in itself .
in 2008 , several german courts ruled that boere could not stand trial in germany because of his advanced age .
maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .

he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

critics say it does not tackle the country 's soaring budget deficit . german president horst koehler swore in angela merkel on wednesday after she was formally elected chancellor by the lower house of parliament .
her new cabinet was also sworn in . " i accept the result and thank you for your trust , " merkel said as lawmakers applauded in the main chamber of the reichstag parliament building .

the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 30.10.2009 dutch music project turns living rooms into live venues großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's no simulating the thrill of live music your favorite band might just show up at your door very soon .
the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .
so this created a small network but it did n't really work out . "
it was n't until jonkheer relaunched the house concert project in 2002 - this time with the help of the internet - that it really took off .
two sets on a sunday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the second coming of liylr has been aided by the internet anyone can host a living room concert as long as they live in one of the12 dutch and belgian cities currently on the live in your living room tour schedule .
mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .
" the idea was to have an intimate concert without people shouting for beers at the bar and people talking over the music , " jonkheer said .
" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .
for their part , the audience members can get much closer to top musicians than they would be able to in a stadium or hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer-songwriters are keen to appear at living room shows it is unlikely that any megabands - say , the remaining beatles or led zeppelin - will choose a living room as the venue for their next comeback concert , but hosts may still get a well-known dutch or belgian artist turning up to entertain them .
or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .
expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .
“ we did a series of 10 concerts and had a wonderful experience over there , " mulder said .
" doing house concerts , the new island festival , and playing living rooms ... i 'm still in contact with people who attended our concerts and liked the music and also with musicians we played with .
people were so enthusiastic that they are now arranging stuff with record-companies and so on .
i am quite sure that if we would have only done clubs , this would not have happened . ”
as the project goes from country to country , it seems ever more likely that you will soon be able to catch a band in a living room near you in the future - maybe even in your own .

the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .

mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .

" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .

" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .
for their part , the audience members can get much closer to top musicians than they would be able to in a stadium or hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer-songwriters are keen to appear at living room shows it is unlikely that any megabands - say , the remaining beatles or led zeppelin - will choose a living room as the venue for their next comeback concert , but hosts may still get a well-known dutch or belgian artist turning up to entertain them .
or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .
expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .
“ we did a series of 10 concerts and had a wonderful experience over there , " mulder said .
" doing house concerts , the new island festival , and playing living rooms ... i 'm still in contact with people who attended our concerts and liked the music and also with musicians we played with .
people were so enthusiastic that they are now arranging stuff with record-companies and so on .
i am quite sure that if we would have only done clubs , this would not have happened . ”
as the project goes from country to country , it seems ever more likely that you will soon be able to catch a band in a living room near you in the future - maybe even in your own .

but now businesses are realizing there 's a lot of money to be made catering to the growing muslim population . it is just after working hours , and customers are slowly rolling into the uemit turkish supermarket in bonn .
the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .

as a commission for deutsche welle , he wrote the work " le chi vien " for violin and orchestra , a " poem symphony . " the work tells the tragic story of the national hero nguyen trai , who , though innocent , was executed for regicide in 1442 together with his family .
twenty years later , nguyen was rehabilitated - but not his wife , nguyen thi lo .

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .
it was given its first performance in 1985 in the bolshoi theater in moscow . the 36-year-old tran manh hung is among the most successful composers of his generation .
as a commission for deutsche welle , he wrote the work " le chi vien " for violin and orchestra , a " poem symphony . " the work tells the tragic story of the national hero nguyen trai , who , though innocent , was executed for regicide in 1442 together with his family .
twenty years later , nguyen was rehabilitated - but not his wife , nguyen thi lo .

but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .
as the victory of the democratic opposition was being announced on june 4 , 1989 , it was like a dream come true for the 10 million solidarity members who had started the long march to freedom a decade before .
unlike in other countries of central and eastern europe , where anti-communist struggle was limited to narrow groups of dissidents , a mass grassroots movement had developed in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : the events that led to the fall of communist europe prague embassy crisis ' a severe blow to the berlin wall , ' genscher says the picnic that changed european history historic east german refugee train rolls again peace prayers helped bring down the wall , says leipzig pastor history -pipe- 30.10.2009 poland blazed the trail for the fall of communism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the founding of the solidarity movement marked the beginning of the end for poland 's communist regime much of the world now associates the end of communism in europe with the collapse of the berlin wall .
but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .
as the victory of the democratic opposition was being announced on june 4 , 1989 , it was like a dream come true for the 10 million solidarity members who had started the long march to freedom a decade before .
unlike in other countries of central and eastern europe , where anti-communist struggle was limited to narrow groups of dissidents , a mass grassroots movement had developed in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .

" in his music , beethoven always tried to take things to the limit : not just the formal limit , but also the limit of the instruments available to him , " ronald brautigam said in an interview with dw . like beethoven , brautigam - the " king of that strange period beast , the fortepiano , " as the times once called him - went to the limits of what the fortepiano has to offer .
he gave a spirited , fearless account of the " waldstein " sonata , with glistening , seemingly endless chains of trills and glissandi .
in the lyrical " pastoral , " he played with an enchantingly cantabile touch , drawing silvery , lustrous sounds from the instrument . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 11 in b-flat major op. 22 piano sonata no. 15 in d major op. 28 , “ pastoral “ piano sonata no. 27 in e minor op. 90 piano sonata no. 21 in c major op. 53 , “ waldstein sonata “ performed by : ronald brautigam , fortepiano performed on september 24 , 2009 at the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . marita berg / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 30.10.2009 former dissident 's database opens old wounds in czech republic großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the velvet revolution ended communism in czechoslovakia like most post-communist states , the czech republic has a special office to archive and make available documents gathered by the secret police .
but one man 's attempt to speed up the process is ruffling feathers . communist czechoslovakia relied on a web of security services to crush all opposition to socialism , and chief among them was the hated secret police , the statni bezpecnost or stb .
the stb , like any spy agency , kept hundreds of thousands of files on agents , informers , and targets of surveillance .
today , they 're stored at the archives of the state-funded institute for the study of totalitarian regimes in prague .
the archives are open to the public , although you have to know roughly what you 're looking for before they 'll let you in .
after all , as institute spokesman jiri reichl says , the archives are home to some 280 million pages of material stretching 20 kilometers -lrb- 12 miles -rrb- .
the material is now being digitally scanned - a laborious process that will take decades to complete .
eventually , it will allow the institute to put all the secret police files on the internet .
at present , however , researchers and curious members of the public have to visit the institute in person to see the contents of their file , or indeed any other file , as the law now allows anyone to view documents on any person .
but for some , that new transparency is not enough .
former dissident posts database bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just like the gdr archive , documents in the czech archive would stretch over many kilometers stanislav penc is a former dissident who lives in seclusion on a goat farm 80 kilometers outside prague .
he 's on a one-man mission to break what he calls the institute 's monopoly on the past .
in the late 1980s , the stb started building a computerized database to keep track of its files .
penc says he received a copy of the database by e-mail from jan langos , the first director of the equivalent institute in slovakia , before his death in 2005 .
penc says he twice asked the institute to put the database online as a research tool to help people find the files they were looking for .
the institute refused .
so early in july , he did it himself .
" so far , my website has been accessed by 400,000 people , " penc told deutsche welle .
" in the first few days , i was bombarded with e-mails and phone calls from people who said they had no idea the secret police had a file on them until they checked my site . ”
penc 's website is straightforward and user-friendly .
enter a name in the database , and the system gives you a list of all the stb files on that person .
you ca n't view the file 's contents , but armed with a reference number , you can go to the archives and request to see it .
" there are a lot of politicians - and also a lot of historians working at the institute - who like to claim that , 20 years after the revolution , only a small minority of czechs are actually interested in the history of the communist period , " penc says .
" i think 400,000 people are enough to prove them wrong . "
database contains mistakes , agency says the institute does n't question the authenticity of the database .
but it does question its reliability , which is why it 's refused to put it online .
the database was compiled by stb employees , some of whom were brought out of retirement to carry out the laborious task of copying the existing paper reference system onto rudimentary 1980s computers .
those workers , says the institute , made a lot of mistakes .
but most importantly , what the database does n't tell you is whether the person was an agent , an informer , or simply someone of interest to the stb .
and that , says the body 's director pavel zacek , is causing a great deal of confusion .
" some people do n't know what it means when they see that there is information about them , so that 's a problem , " zacek says .
" -lrb- penc -rrb- published everything - even information about the activities of the czechoslovak security services after 1990 .
he published information about foreigners , which we can not by law publish .
but he did it , and it 's a problem , not for us , but for him . "
czech society has undergone a huge transformation in the past two decades , and most people today have far more mundane concerns .
but the row over stanislav penc and his amateur stb database has reopened a lot of old wounds .
it has proved , perhaps , that in a former totalitarian country , the past is never very far behind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 30.10.2009 eu countries strike groundbreaking climate deal but skimp on details großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu leaders say they know which way the climate wind is blowing the agreement marks a breakthrough in eu efforts to lead the fight in reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the developing world , but questions remain on how the bill will be shared among the 27 member states . european union leaders meeting in brussels have reached a breakthrough compromise on climate control , strengthening their position ahead of a global summit on climate change to be held in copenhagen in december .
european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
lisbon treaty gets a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty remains in the czech republic the brussels summit also bore good news for the lisbon reform treaty when members agreed to an opt-out for the czech republic on a human rights charter .
czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .
a decision on who will get the new post was put off until another meeting .
the last remaining hurdle lies with the czech constitutional court , which is scheduled to rule on a legal challenge to the treaty next tuesday. acb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .

another bahn director , who was not identified by the ftd , warned that existing cross-border cooperation could be jeopardized by this step .
sncf would not be able to realize their plans before 2011 as next year 's railway timetables have already been completed .
however , db will face another challenger on inter-city routes from 2010 onwards .
berlin-based locomore rail will operate several times a day between cologne and hamburg from next summer , managing director derek ladewig told die welt .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 30.10.2009 the charm of budapest großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : budapest is famous for its beautiful architecture and historic attractions budapest is one of europe 's most beautiful cities with stunning architecture and wonderful views across the river danube .
it 's a captivating city as dw correspondent arpad szoczi knows very well . i first got to know hungary and hungarians from thousands of kilometers away , growing up in toronto , canada .
i was listening to the stories of my father , a hungarian political refugee who escaped from his home country in 1952 .
then later in life i became a hungarian and eventually bought a home in budapest .
living part of my life now in the hungarian capital , i see that some of the tumultuous times my father described to me still exist .
fortunately , other things make up for it .
i 'll never forget covering a wild anti-government demonstration as a reporter in budapest in october of 2006 .
hundreds of rioters had stormed the main public broadcaster 's tv building , and then later had closed down and barricaded one of the main bridges connecting buda and pest .
as for me , i had to go to an eye clinic because i had developed an outrageous eye infection after being tear-gassed so much .
bildunterschrift : arpad szoczi feels right at home in his ancestral city the political climate remains vitriolic today .
fortunately , none of that can change what i love the most – the city .
for me , there is nothing in this world that equals being on the banks of the danube river between buda and pest on a boat-restaurant on a beautiful summer evening sipping a glass of tokaji and reveling in the surroundings .
and i can safely say that about the hungarian capital after having been to four continents … i still revel in the city 's amazing architecture that is especially apparent on classy andrassy street with its addictive coffee houses .
and you can get a quick history lesson of the country by simply going to heroes ' square .
as one romanian tourist surveying the area once told me , " you can see here that they used to rule an empire . "
getting around budapest via the subway is the best way to go to avoid the constant budapest traffic jams .
the joke in the hilly half of the capital – buda – is that the moment any drops of rain fall , traffic there grinds to a halt .
sometimes , if i want to escape the hustle-and-bustle , i go to the wonderful oasis right on the danube called margaret island .
i usually go for a swim in the huge public pool there , but sometimes just a nice walk will do the trick .
before i know it , it 's already nightfall .
and that 's when i can appreciate the unusual talent that hungarians have – they are incredibly musical .
that 's partly because music is a compulsory subject in schools for much longer than in other countries .
everyone seems to be able to play something .
so , i try whenever i can to check out a hungarian concert – be it pop or classical .
and now looking back on my own life , i understand why my father still pined half-a-century later for his homeland .

critics say it does not tackle the country 's soaring budget deficit . german president horst koehler swore in angela merkel on wednesday after she was formally elected chancellor by the lower house of parliament .
her new cabinet was also sworn in . " i accept the result and thank you for your trust , " merkel said as lawmakers applauded in the main chamber of the reichstag parliament building .
the majority of german mps voted for merkel , as she received 323 ' yes ' votes out of 622 .
while the vote is secret , calculations show that apparently nine parliamentarians from merkel 's own coalition withheld their support .
merkel , 55 , whose christian democrats emerged as the strongest party following the general election on september 27 , enters her second term with a new coalition between her conservatives and the pro-business free democrats .
tackling the economy as criticism mounts over merkel 's economic plan , president koehler warned the chancellor against " unrealistic growth hopes " and said germany must reduce its debt levels .
merkel 's coalition announced a policy program last week which includes 24 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- in tax cuts ; though it is not entirely clear how the government plans to finance them .
political opponents say she needs to do more to reduce germany 's enormous debt .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french president nicolas sarkozy supports merkel 's tax cuts luxembourg 's prime minister , jean-claude juncker , chairman of the 16-nation eurozone , said that germany 's debt level was " excessive and scarcely bearable for the next generation . "
so far , merkel has not committed herself to making any unpopular spending cuts , and has maintained that cutting taxes will help germany 's economy recover . french president nicolas sarkozy praised merkel 's tax-cutting plan as he hosted her in paris on wednesday evening .
" your choice of growth by lowering taxes is a very useful choice for europe , " sarkozy told reporters at his elysee palace before dinner with merkel .
" the composition and the program of your coalition government are good news for france . "
during the meeting , merkel also agreed to come to paris on november 11 for armistice day to commemorate those who lost their lives in the two world wars .
she is to be the first german leader to attend the ceremony. vj / jam / ap / reuters / epd / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the live in your living room project started in the netherlands and is now out to get top musicians performing in homes all over the world . a state-of the-art stereo system can make music lovers feel like they 've been transported to front-row seats at a concert , without leaving their own living room .
but even for those who can afford a system with surround-sound and crystal clear acoustics , no one has yet created a stereo that can reproduce the smell , the presence or the electricity of watching a live band .
which is why the " live in your living room " project is proving so popular .
" i first had the idea to organize house concerts on a regular basis back in the early 90s when i was a student , " founder kees jonkheer told deutsche welle .
" i organized a concert about once or twice a month , mailing people and sending out fliers because this was before the internet was really huge .
so this created a small network but it did n't really work out . "
it was n't until jonkheer relaunched the house concert project in 2002 - this time with the help of the internet - that it really took off .
two sets on a sunday bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the second coming of liylr has been aided by the internet anyone can host a living room concert as long as they live in one of the12 dutch and belgian cities currently on the live in your living room tour schedule .
mainly taking place on sunday evenings at around 8:00 pm , three diverse bands each play an initial set of 15 minutes to a gathered audience of friends and strangers .
the playing is broken up by intervals of 20 minutes , which allows the paying guests to socialize over drinks and snacks .
the bands then perform a second set , again of about 15 minutes each . while the internet can take some credit for making the promotion and organization of the living room concerts much easier , jonkheer believes that the uniqueness of the live event itself is responsible for the concept 's growing popularity .
" the idea was to have an intimate concert without people shouting for beers at the bar and people talking over the music , " jonkheer said .
" it 's a very intimate environment and the audience is very attentive - and the artists love this . "
' microscopic ' performances michel mulder of the band lee mason agrees .
his band signed up for live in your living room and have thoroughly enjoyed their experiences .
" imagine you are in a room with 30 , 40 people and at a certain point someone says , ' hey , this is michel and he is gonna sing you a song ' , " mulder said . " then everybody looks at you and there 's total silence .
and no stage .
and you do n't know anyone , but the other people all know one another . " " it 's a very microscopic way of performing , " he said .
" every breath you take will be heard , every drop of sweat will be seen and every mistake will be very , very apparent and might break the spell .
you have to adjust yourself to that , but when you do , and you really get into your music the audience will be able to follow you very closely .
and that 's just an amazing way of playing for people .
because it 's so intimate and literally close , the audience can really see what you are doing . " do n't expect led zeppelin the environment is so attractive to artists that the organization has been able to book well-known artists for small fees - just because they 're interested in playing in living rooms .
for their part , the audience members can get much closer to top musicians than they would be able to in a stadium or hall .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : singer-songwriters are keen to appear at living room shows it is unlikely that any megabands - say , the remaining beatles or led zeppelin - will choose a living room as the venue for their next comeback concert , but hosts may still get a well-known dutch or belgian artist turning up to entertain them .
or , more likely , an up-and-coming act taking their first steps to stardom could be sandwiched between their dvd collection and a house plant .
successful dutch singer-songwriter ane brun has graced a number of cosy apartments on the circuit while belgium 's up-and-coming troubadour the bony king of nowhere has been known to strum his stuff in the odd parlor .
" as a host , you are most welcome to express your preferences for which kind of music you want , but we do n't want the host to become responsible for creating a bill of artists so we mostly confer with the host and book the bands we think will work , " said jonkheer .
" we normally mix it up with well-known artists and newcomers , so the new guys can have the experience of appearing with established acts , and we continue to book acts as we 've always done , mainly from the alternative music scene . "
promoting artists , providing entertainment the living rooms concerts do n't only provide a service and entertainment in private houses for people who want an intimate musical experience , they also give singers and groups the chance to play live in an usual setting and bring their music to new audiences .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the success of liylr has music-industry listening " we had the idea from the start that we would balance the promotion of bands with the service aspect of the business , giving the promotion and entertainment sides equal importance in our plan , " said jonkheer .
" it seems to be a very popular model because , although there 's no data to support this , more venues are looking to the living room concerts as a model for how they present and promote bands .
he also noted that some bands now playing in large venues on the club circuit were completely unknown before they played in living rooms .
with the living room concept taking off in a big way , jonkheer and his regional organizers have had to come up with other ideas as to how they can serve the growing demand for house concerts .
from putting on one show a month in 2002 , the team now puts on about 90 shows a year .
expansion into tours and international festivals in an attempt to keep things fresh , the organizers have now branched out to provide the liylr tour , a ten-date tour schedule for artists and bands wanting to play in living rooms throughout the netherlands and belgium .
the liylr team plans the tour to the band 's specifications and arranges living rooms and dates tailored to their needs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : artists enjoy the alternative tour schedule " the live in your living room tour is based on the idea that the artist or the act is the client and they can come to us and say , ' we want a tour of about ten living rooms , playing in these cities , and we 're available on these dates . '
then we work it out , " jonkheer said .
the tour concept was started just this year and the fifth tour is already in the works .
in addition , the living room concept is spreading further afield - even to new york , where the team 's first festival took place in september .
the idea is to promote dutch and belgian bands in new york who would n't find it easy to set up a tour on their own .
barcelona is the next city on the list for a mini home-concert festival . " we had seven living room concerts in one week , and we hope to do that again in april , " jonkheer said of the new york project .
" we 're now planning for the next one and we 've already had 25 bands applying , including some quite well-known bands who are really looking to get spotted in the states . "
lee mason played in the new york festival and marcel mulder can attest to its success .
“ we did a series of 10 concerts and had a wonderful experience over there , " mulder said .
" doing house concerts , the new island festival , and playing living rooms ... i 'm still in contact with people who attended our concerts and liked the music and also with musicians we played with .
people were so enthusiastic that they are now arranging stuff with record-companies and so on .
i am quite sure that if we would have only done clubs , this would not have happened . ”
as the project goes from country to country , it seems ever more likely that you will soon be able to catch a band in a living room near you in the future - maybe even in your own .

"
the country remains deeply divided over the issue . the government has put forward two proposals to address the matter - the first would see assisted suicide banned altogether , while the second , and most likely to be approved , would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf argued in favor of an individual 's right to choose the moment of their death .
" we do n't want a total ban , " she said , " but we do want to limit the current practice .
we do n't want to be a country with a reputation for suicide tourism . "
she said that in order for an assisted suicide organization to avoid prosecution it would have to require that a patient obtained testimony from two doctors , and had expressed a wish to die over a long period of time .
schlumpf ruled out the practice of foreigners arriving in switzerland and dying within days .
quick deaths in recent years , dozens of people have travelled to switzerland to use the services of dignitas , a leading assisted suicide organization in the alpine nation .
many came from germany and britain , where assisted suicide remains illegal .
dignitas has now come under scrutiny in switzerland because of its policy of assisting those who are not terminally ill , and for the alleged speed with which the organization deals with its patients .
dignitas treats primarily foreign patients who typically arrive in switzerland , see one dignitas doctor and then die within hours .
the proposal that assisted suicide should be limited only to the terminally ill has angered another organization , exit , whose president , hans wehrli , said that denying assisted suicide to the chronically ill would be going too far .
" a third of our patients are not terminally ill , but they are really suffering , and they want to die , " he said .
" the government has put them in the position where they would have to shoot themselves or jump in front of a train .
" the government says these proposals safeguard dignity in death and the right to choose , but they do n't .
this is n't dignity , it 's cruelty , " wehrli added .
both proposals are now open for public debate before going to switzerland 's parliament next march .
exit and dignitas have said they would , if necessary , push for a nationwide vote on the issue of exactly how far the limits on assisted suicide should go .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 30.10.2009 halal food market on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany say it is still difficult to find halal products in most grocery stores muslims in europe have long struggled to find halal food products , which abide by islamic law .
but now businesses are realizing there 's a lot of money to be made catering to the growing muslim population . it is just after working hours , and customers are slowly rolling into the uemit turkish supermarket in bonn .
the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food chains in europe are increasingly serving up halal products to cater to muslims " i think the business will go on and it 's a big trend , " she says .
" we saw how many people came to the halal stands at the anuga food trade fair to get information about it . "
" they were not all muslims - there were people from all over the world , from pakistanis to chinese people .
so i think it 's a big market place . " author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
the country remains deeply divided over the issue . the government has put forward two proposals to address the matter - the first would see assisted suicide banned altogether , while the second , and most likely to be approved , would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf argued in favor of an individual 's right to choose the moment of their death .
" we do n't want a total ban , " she said , " but we do want to limit the current practice .
we do n't want to be a country with a reputation for suicide tourism . "
she said that in order for an assisted suicide organization to avoid prosecution it would have to require that a patient obtained testimony from two doctors , and had expressed a wish to die over a long period of time .
schlumpf ruled out the practice of foreigners arriving in switzerland and dying within days .
quick deaths in recent years , dozens of people have travelled to switzerland to use the services of dignitas , a leading assisted suicide organization in the alpine nation .
many came from germany and britain , where assisted suicide remains illegal .
dignitas has now come under scrutiny in switzerland because of its policy of assisting those who are not terminally ill , and for the alleged speed with which the organization deals with its patients .
dignitas treats primarily foreign patients who typically arrive in switzerland , see one dignitas doctor and then die within hours .
the proposal that assisted suicide should be limited only to the terminally ill has angered another organization , exit , whose president , hans wehrli , said that denying assisted suicide to the chronically ill would be going too far .
" a third of our patients are not terminally ill , but they are really suffering , and they want to die , " he said .
" the government has put them in the position where they would have to shoot themselves or jump in front of a train .
" the government says these proposals safeguard dignity in death and the right to choose , but they do n't .
this is n't dignity , it 's cruelty , " wehrli added .
both proposals are now open for public debate before going to switzerland 's parliament next march .
exit and dignitas have said they would , if necessary , push for a nationwide vote on the issue of exactly how far the limits on assisted suicide should go .

but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .
as the victory of the democratic opposition was being announced on june 4 , 1989 , it was like a dream come true for the 10 million solidarity members who had started the long march to freedom a decade before .
unlike in other countries of central and eastern europe , where anti-communist struggle was limited to narrow groups of dissidents , a mass grassroots movement had developed in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .

a nato report on the incident said the death toll is uncertain . general wolfgang schneiderhan , the general inspector of the german armed forces , or bundeswehr , told reporters on thursday that he had seen a classified nato report prepared on an airstrike on hijacked trucks and came to the conclusion that the controversial order was " appropriate . "
on september 4 , colonel georg klein summoned us air support to destroy two fuel tankers which had been hijacked by the taliban a few kilometers from a german base in northern afghanistan .
villagers said that the bombs also killed civilians who were stealing fuel from the trucks which had become stranded in a river bed .
" i see no grounds to doubt that they acted appropriately , " schneiderhan said of the officers involved .
casualty figures according to the nato report , it is no longer possible to determine an exact number of those killed .
different sources report widely different casualty numbers - between 17 and 142 people .
the report says there could have been between 30 and 40 civilians killed or wounded in the incident .

in the past , he said , stolen tankers and trucks had been used by the taliban in attacks that resulted in many casualties .
there were indications that similar attacks were planned on the german reconstruction team there .

at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .
both of these men are in their late 80s , which raises the question of why they were not brought to justice earlier .
boere lived openly in western germany for decades .
demjanjuk had us citizenship for years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk maintains his innocence the cases illustrate how difficult it can be to prosecute crimes from this era , as the accused and witnesses alike die and evidence becomes harder to come by .
legal statutes from different countries and periods can also gum up the wheels of justice .
to many , the fact that the two men are answering for their crimes more than 60 years after the fact is an example of a legal system that is not able , or perhaps even willing , to bring all the perpetrators to justice .
in the period from 1945 to 2005 , there have been 4,964 trials regarding nazi crimes .
in many people 's eyes , that number is too low .
is justice possible ?
in fact , political philosopher hannah arendt said the crimes committed by the nazis had shattered the very foundations of justice in the western world and it was necessary to rethink what it meant to judge crime and criminality .
but edith raim , a historian at the institute for contemporary history in munich , said despite the frustration felt by many at the slow , or inadequate , wheels of justice , the german judiciary has been fairly relentless in its pursuit of nazi perpetrators .
" it 's impressive that the german justice system has been so active in this area for such a long time , even sometimes against public opinion , " she said .
" while today the public is very interested in these trials , that was n't always the case .
in the 50s , people did n't want anything to do with them , but the judiciary went ahead with prosecutions . "
german prosecutors have conducted investigations of nazi crimes every year since 1945 , unlike in other countries .
austria 's last big nazi trial took place in the mid-70s .
the us stopped its trials in 1948 , britain one year later .
nuremberg 's legacy it was the trials just after world war two , however , which garnered the most international attention and left a mark that is still being felt in jurisprudence today .
the nuremberg trials of top nazi officials , including hermann goering , captivated the world , detailing as they did the unprecedented crimes of the nazi regime .
but legal experts agree that the trials also laid a new foundation for international law , allowing for the first time a court to directly charge and punish an individual based on international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg trials broke new ground in the field of international law " up to that point , people had believed a national penal law was needed .
nuremberg put an end to that , saying that some deeds were so horrible that the international community had to directly intervene , " said christian tomuschat , a law professor at berlin 's humboldt university .
the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .
" the many hundred thousands of victims who were n't able to have a life often are forgotten , " she said .

opposition and non-government circles have reacted with alarm . niebel told a german newspaper that economic powers like china and india , commonly referred to as " developing nations , " no longer met the criteria of that distinction .
" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .
niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .
the combination of the two ministries , the party said , would establish a german foreign policy with " one voice . "
meanwhile , the opposition has reacted with alarm to the fdp being at the head of the development ministry .
social democrat spokesman sascha rabbe called niebel 's appointment as development minister a " bad joke . "
" it 's nothing short of ridiculous that the people who were trying to dissolve the development ministry have now put one of their own at the head of it .
it looks now like niebel will turn the development ministry into a liquidation ministry , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are perplexed at the naming of niebel as development minister broken promises ?
criticism also come from development groups .
claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .
it says , on the contrary , that it is looking for ways to step up the fight against global poverty. glb / ips / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .
both of these men are in their late 80s , which raises the question of why they were not brought to justice earlier .
boere lived openly in western germany for decades .
demjanjuk had us citizenship for years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk maintains his innocence the cases illustrate how difficult it can be to prosecute crimes from this era , as the accused and witnesses alike die and evidence becomes harder to come by .
legal statutes from different countries and periods can also gum up the wheels of justice .
to many , the fact that the two men are answering for their crimes more than 60 years after the fact is an example of a legal system that is not able , or perhaps even willing , to bring all the perpetrators to justice .
in the period from 1945 to 2005 , there have been 4,964 trials regarding nazi crimes .
in many people 's eyes , that number is too low .
is justice possible ?
in fact , political philosopher hannah arendt said the crimes committed by the nazis had shattered the very foundations of justice in the western world and it was necessary to rethink what it meant to judge crime and criminality .
but edith raim , a historian at the institute for contemporary history in munich , said despite the frustration felt by many at the slow , or inadequate , wheels of justice , the german judiciary has been fairly relentless in its pursuit of nazi perpetrators .
" it 's impressive that the german justice system has been so active in this area for such a long time , even sometimes against public opinion , " she said .
" while today the public is very interested in these trials , that was n't always the case .
in the 50s , people did n't want anything to do with them , but the judiciary went ahead with prosecutions . "
german prosecutors have conducted investigations of nazi crimes every year since 1945 , unlike in other countries .
austria 's last big nazi trial took place in the mid-70s .
the us stopped its trials in 1948 , britain one year later .
nuremberg 's legacy it was the trials just after world war two , however , which garnered the most international attention and left a mark that is still being felt in jurisprudence today .
the nuremberg trials of top nazi officials , including hermann goering , captivated the world , detailing as they did the unprecedented crimes of the nazi regime .
but legal experts agree that the trials also laid a new foundation for international law , allowing for the first time a court to directly charge and punish an individual based on international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg trials broke new ground in the field of international law " up to that point , people had believed a national penal law was needed .
nuremberg put an end to that , saying that some deeds were so horrible that the international community had to directly intervene , " said christian tomuschat , a law professor at berlin 's humboldt university .
the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .
" the many hundred thousands of victims who were n't able to have a life often are forgotten , " she said .
" i think these trials can serve as a reminder of the immeasurable suffering these victims and their loved ones endured . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de medicine -pipe- 30.10.2009 switzerland considers limiting euthanasia to stop ' suicide tourism ' großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the swiss have voted overwhelmingly in favor of assisted suicide in the past the swiss government has unveiled proposals to tighten the country 's laws on assisted suicide in an effort to limit what has become known as " suicide tourism . "
the country remains deeply divided over the issue . the government has put forward two proposals to address the matter - the first would see assisted suicide banned altogether , while the second , and most likely to be approved , would limit the practice to the terminally ill .
swiss justice minister eveline widmer schlumpf argued in favor of an individual 's right to choose the moment of their death .
" we do n't want a total ban , " she said , " but we do want to limit the current practice .
we do n't want to be a country with a reputation for suicide tourism . "
she said that in order for an assisted suicide organization to avoid prosecution it would have to require that a patient obtained testimony from two doctors , and had expressed a wish to die over a long period of time .
schlumpf ruled out the practice of foreigners arriving in switzerland and dying within days .
quick deaths in recent years , dozens of people have travelled to switzerland to use the services of dignitas , a leading assisted suicide organization in the alpine nation .
many came from germany and britain , where assisted suicide remains illegal .
dignitas has now come under scrutiny in switzerland because of its policy of assisting those who are not terminally ill , and for the alleged speed with which the organization deals with its patients .
dignitas treats primarily foreign patients who typically arrive in switzerland , see one dignitas doctor and then die within hours .
the proposal that assisted suicide should be limited only to the terminally ill has angered another organization , exit , whose president , hans wehrli , said that denying assisted suicide to the chronically ill would be going too far .
" a third of our patients are not terminally ill , but they are really suffering , and they want to die , " he said .
" the government has put them in the position where they would have to shoot themselves or jump in front of a train .
" the government says these proposals safeguard dignity in death and the right to choose , but they do n't .
this is n't dignity , it 's cruelty , " wehrli added .
both proposals are now open for public debate before going to switzerland 's parliament next march .
exit and dignitas have said they would , if necessary , push for a nationwide vote on the issue of exactly how far the limits on assisted suicide should go .

on wednesday , the bundestag is to meet to re-elect merkel as chancellor . lammert used the first speech of his second term as bundestag president to call for a host of improvements to the parliament 's protocol , as well as a one-year extension to the legislative period .
lammert pointed to statistics suggesting that german voters felt they had too many elections , and suggested holding general elections every five years , rather than every four .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert called for reforms in his inaugural speech lammert , who was re-elected for this term with a slightly reduced majority of 84.6 percent , also called on representatives not to saddle the parliament with unnecessary work , and " self-critically check " the resolutions and initiatives they planned . he encouraged parliamentarians to be more self-confident .
" the bundestag is not a support-organ , but the heart of the formation of our country 's political will , " he told representatives .
spd relegated to the back the seating arrangements in the new parliament did offer a startling image of how german politics changed in the september 27 vote .
merkel 's grand coalition partners in the last government , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , were devastated by the election , seeing their representation in the bundestag drop from 221 deputies to 146 .
this has forced the spd to give up two of its highly-prized front row seats in the bundestag , and leading figures in the grand coalition government , like former finance minister peer steinbrueck , have now been relegated to the distant back rows .
on wednesday , lammert is to chair a meeting in which the bundestag is to re-elect chancellor merkel at the head of new coalition government made up of her christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . bk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on wednesday , the bundestag is to meet to re-elect merkel as chancellor . lammert used the first speech of his second term as bundestag president to call for a host of improvements to the parliament 's protocol , as well as a one-year extension to the legislative period .
lammert pointed to statistics suggesting that german voters felt they had too many elections , and suggested holding general elections every five years , rather than every four .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert called for reforms in his inaugural speech lammert , who was re-elected for this term with a slightly reduced majority of 84.6 percent , also called on representatives not to saddle the parliament with unnecessary work , and " self-critically check " the resolutions and initiatives they planned . he encouraged parliamentarians to be more self-confident .
" the bundestag is not a support-organ , but the heart of the formation of our country 's political will , " he told representatives .
spd relegated to the back the seating arrangements in the new parliament did offer a startling image of how german politics changed in the september 27 vote .
merkel 's grand coalition partners in the last government , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , were devastated by the election , seeing their representation in the bundestag drop from 221 deputies to 146 .
this has forced the spd to give up two of its highly-prized front row seats in the bundestag , and leading figures in the grand coalition government , like former finance minister peer steinbrueck , have now been relegated to the distant back rows .
on wednesday , lammert is to chair a meeting in which the bundestag is to re-elect chancellor merkel at the head of new coalition government made up of her christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . bk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 30.10.2009 halal food market on the rise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims in germany say it is still difficult to find halal products in most grocery stores muslims in europe have long struggled to find halal food products , which abide by islamic law .
but now businesses are realizing there 's a lot of money to be made catering to the growing muslim population . it is just after working hours , and customers are slowly rolling into the uemit turkish supermarket in bonn .
the shelves are packed full with turkish delicacies , and colorful fruit stands stretch across the front entrance .
a handful of shoppers have made their way to the halal meat counter at the back of the store .
rabia kasik , a young store clerk , says their customers like to shop there because it is one of the few places in bonn where muslims can buy halal food , including chicken patties , beef burgers - even gummi bears .
" people can find halal food here , and in a few other specialty markets - but not in many other places .
it is difficult for muslims in germany , because everything is mixed with pork , " kasik says .
halal is an arabic term that means " lawful " , and it refers to a way of life that adheres to islamic law .
any food or drink can be halal if it meets muslim standards .
for example , meat products can not contain pork , and food producers must clean their machines with alcohol-free detergents .
halal business booming experts say that halal food is the fastest growing food sectors in the world .
it already accounts for 17 percent of the global food market , according to the world halal forum .
in 2010 , halal food is expected to generate sales of more than 45 billion euros in europe alone .
with the muslim population in the eu growing due to immigration and higher birth rates , businesses are starting to realize the untapped potential of the halal food market .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : muslims have varying standards for halal certification in france and britain , which have the eu 's largest muslim populations , this trend has been gaining momentum for some time .
british supermarket chains , sainsbury 's and tesco sell halal products , as does the french chain casino .
even the american fast-food joint kentucky fried chicken serves food that abides by islamic standards at many of its european restaurants .
mustafa balikci is the head of anatolia foods , a company that specializes in halal products .
its headquarters is located in the small german town of rheinbreitbach , where he grew up , but the company is now represented in nine countries .
" the idea was to establish a market for halal products in europe , because it 's very difficult for muslims in europe to find halal products " balikci says .
" even if a product 's label says it 's halal , muslims have to be very careful because it may not be accurate .
it 's sometimes hard to know if something is really halal or not . "
germany still lagging in halal business mustafa balikci says germany has been slow to stock its store shelves with halal products compared to other european countries , due in part to the controversial process by which meat is certified " halal " .
muslims broadly agree that the animal must be alive and devoid of any drugs when it is slaughtered - something that goes against german law , which requires abattoirs to use sedatives .
as a result , most halal food producers in germany have to import their meat .
despite the legal barriers , however , hatice balikci - who 's also part of the family halal food business - says she is not worried .
in fact , she believes that germany 's four million muslims mean an expansion of the halal food market is inevitable .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fast food chains in europe are increasingly serving up halal products to cater to muslims " i think the business will go on and it 's a big trend , " she says .
" we saw how many people came to the halal stands at the anuga food trade fair to get information about it . "
" they were not all muslims - there were people from all over the world , from pakistanis to chinese people .
so i think it 's a big market place . " author : vanessa johnston editor : sam edmonds send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he was the only person that actually had money within the npd .
he owned a lot of property in the hamburg area , and he gave loans to the npd .
the question is whether his four children demand to get this money back , " sundermeyer said .
an inheritance of debt ?
the party has been plagued with financial problems in recent years .
the npd had to pay back 1.27 million euros -lrb- $ 1.89 million -rrb- in public campaign funds to the german government after a former treasurer was charged with embezzling over 700,000 euros in 2008 .
the head of the hamburg office for the protection of the constitution , heino vahldieck , called reiger 's death a significant blow for the npd and far-right organizations in germany .
" he was for a long time a beacon -as much for his biography as for his financial contributions , " vahldieck told the associated press .
according to dpa , rieger leaves behind an estimated fortune of 500,000 euros .
it 's not yet known if rieger left any money to the party in his will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger had many contacts within the militant neo-nazi wing of the npd who 's next ?
sundermeyer says that rieger 's death could set off a power-struggle within the npd , between the militant neo-nazis and those in the party who play down its connections to the hitler-era .
" now that he 's dead , the big question will be which of these wings will dominate the npd in the future , " sundermeyer said .
in recent years , rieger had been trying to buy derelict hotels , guest houses , and cinemas for use as " training centers " for the far-right .
his attempts set off a flurry of citizen protests and counter-offers from the municipal governments .
hans-werner schlitte , the mayor of a town where rieger was trying to buy an empty country hotel , said on friday that the community felt not so strongly under pressure since his death .

boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teun de groot , the son of one of boere 's victims , was at the court the judge ruled that the case can not continue until maass gives a clear response to the accusations .
maass did not have a response ready but said he would prepare one by monday when the case resumes .
sheltered from justice although wednesday 's decision is a setback for the prosecution , bringing boere to court at all represents a victory in itself .
in 2008 , several german courts ruled that boere could not stand trial in germany because of his advanced age .
maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

and more than 2,000 artists were indeed “ in the light ” , i.e. on the stage , in 75 concerts and 83 associated events on the last day of the four-week music festival , which had no lack of highlights , kent nagano and the mahler chamber orcestra were the ones in the -lrb- lime- -rrb- light . the program of the final concert consisted of the rarely played orchestral version of the “ grosse fuge ” -lrb- op. 133 -rrb- by beethoven , the metamorphoses by richard strauss and the 1st symphony -lrb- op. 68 -rrb- by johannes brahms . metamorphoses richard strauss wrote the “ metamorphoses ” in 1945 in just one month , finishing them less than four weeks before germany ’ s unconditional surrender in may of that year .
strauss composed the half-hour-long adagio under the direct impression of the bombed-out opera house and general destruction in munich , the city of his birth .
in the first drafts , he gave the piece the title “ sorrow over munich ” . for richard strauss , who had celebrated many successes in famous opera houses , their destruction marked the end of an era .
he called the “ metamorphoses ” a “ reflection of his entire past life ” .
a french critic said euphorically : “ perhaps strauss lived for 85 years just to create this splendid work . ” mahler chamber orchestra kent nagano conducted the mahler chamber orchestra -lrb- mco -rrb- , one of the finest chamber orchestras in the world .
a former youth orchestra , it was founded by claudio abbado .
its members , who come from around 20 different countries , travel in to meet up for project phases . in an interview with dw , kent nagano had this to say about the impressive performance of the “ metamorphoses ” : “ there is something destructive also to be heard in the harmonic structure of this work .
metamorphosis means change , transformation and , in the end , the creation of something new . ” and something new is created every year at the beethovenfest as well : old compositions are played in new interpretations , new ones are premiered , and the new joins with the old – a metamorphosis and a new beginning .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 30.10.2009 ss-hitman trial opens in aachen großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : heinrich boere the trial of former ss soldier heinrich boere was adjourned at its opening after the defense argued that the prosecutor was too emotionally involved .
boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teun de groot , the son of one of boere 's victims , was at the court the judge ruled that the case can not continue until maass gives a clear response to the accusations .
maass did not have a response ready but said he would prepare one by monday when the case resumes .
sheltered from justice although wednesday 's decision is a setback for the prosecution , bringing boere to court at all represents a victory in itself .
in 2008 , several german courts ruled that boere could not stand trial in germany because of his advanced age .
maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

in eight concerts , six interpreters played all 32 of beethoven 's piano sonatas the first concert in the series was given by andrea lucchesini in the beethoven-haus in bonn .
the italian pianist is not among the fortepiano specialists in the historical performance scene .
for his concert , he played both on a fortepiano - a copy of an instrument built in 1824 by the piano maker conrad graf - and a steinway grand .
the latter was not used for beethoven 's music , but for a piano sonata by the composer luciano berio , who died six years ago ; lucchesini premiered the piece in zurich in 2001 . with and without the fortepiano : historical and modern instruments in this concert , two different worlds of piano sound confronted each other to great effect .
in the sonata in f-sharp major , op. 78 , lucchesini made the fortepiano sing with his tender , expressive playing .
the conductor hans von buelow said once of the four-bar adagio introduction to this piece : " if beethoven had written nothing else but these four bars , he would be immortal . " the change to the steinway grand for berio 's piano sonata came almost as a shock .
new tone colors and sounds filled the room , and the volume and explosive dynamics of the modern grand piano seemed to overshadow the intimacy of the fortepiano .
but this intimacy returned with beethoven 's " hammerklavier " sonata , the most radical and innovative work of the sonata cycle at the time of its composition .
when beethoven , by this time almost completely deaf , composed it in 1817/18 , he told his pupil carl czerny : " i am writing a sonata that is to be my greatest . "

among the highlights of the cycle were the two concerts given by the dutch pianist ronald brautigam , who is currently working on a complete recording of the beethoven sonatas and is extremely conversant with the tonal possibilities offered by the fortepiano . even in the composer 's three early sonatas -lrb- op .
2 -rrb- , ronald brautigam made it extremely apparent how finely shaded and subtle beethoven 's music sounds on the fortepiano , quickly calling into question cherished listening habits : beethoven played with the richness of sound produced by a modern concert grand .
it was with these pieces that beethoven , who had initially created a sensation in vienna as a pianist and improviser , presented himself in 1795 for the first time as a composer of piano sonatas as well .
he dedicated them to joseph haydn , who had taught him in 1793 and was present at their first performance . even the dramatically forceful " pathetique " sounded unexpectedly transparent and intriguing on the seemingly fragile fortepiano .
listeners familiar with portraits of beethoven thought they saw a certain resemblance between the composer and his interpreter , ronald brautigam . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 1 in f minor op. 2/1 piano sonata no. 2 in a major op. 2/2 piano sonata no. 3 in c major op. 2/3 piano sonata no. 8 in c minor op. 13 , “ pathetique ” performed by : robert brautigam , fortepiano performed on september 23 , 2009 at the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . marita berg / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and more than 2,000 artists were indeed “ in the light ” , i.e. on the stage , in 75 concerts and 83 associated events on the last day of the four-week music festival , which had no lack of highlights , kent nagano and the mahler chamber orcestra were the ones in the -lrb- lime- -rrb- light . the program of the final concert consisted of the rarely played orchestral version of the “ grosse fuge ” -lrb- op. 133 -rrb- by beethoven , the metamorphoses by richard strauss and the 1st symphony -lrb- op. 68 -rrb- by johannes brahms . metamorphoses richard strauss wrote the “ metamorphoses ” in 1945 in just one month , finishing them less than four weeks before germany ’ s unconditional surrender in may of that year .
strauss composed the half-hour-long adagio under the direct impression of the bombed-out opera house and general destruction in munich , the city of his birth .
in the first drafts , he gave the piece the title “ sorrow over munich ” . for richard strauss , who had celebrated many successes in famous opera houses , their destruction marked the end of an era .
he called the “ metamorphoses ” a “ reflection of his entire past life ” .
a french critic said euphorically : “ perhaps strauss lived for 85 years just to create this splendid work . ” mahler chamber orchestra kent nagano conducted the mahler chamber orchestra -lrb- mco -rrb- , one of the finest chamber orchestras in the world .
a former youth orchestra , it was founded by claudio abbado .
its members , who come from around 20 different countries , travel in to meet up for project phases . in an interview with dw , kent nagano had this to say about the impressive performance of the “ metamorphoses ” : “ there is something destructive also to be heard in the harmonic structure of this work .
metamorphosis means change , transformation and , in the end , the creation of something new . ” and something new is created every year at the beethovenfest as well : old compositions are played in new interpretations , new ones are premiered , and the new joins with the old – a metamorphosis and a new beginning .

3 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eroica symphony is a revolutionary opus inspired by napoleon bonaparte .
listen to parts of the third symphony performed by the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi . much has been written and said about beethoven 's third symphony , a revolutionary work from a revolutionary era .
it was inspired by napoleon bonaparte , who ignited the dreams of a generation .
maestro jarvi , however , is skeptical about the value of words when it comes to understanding a musical masterpiece of this magnitude . dw asked him to find a few words of description for each beethoven symphony . " it doesn ’ t matter how musicologically advanced you might be and how much homework we have done and how much experimentation and how much reading we have done about it : the funeral march in ' eroica ' will mean something entirely different to a 15-year old than to somebody who went through the second world war .
it will mean something different for a person who has lost their child or for a person who is just conceptionally thinking of a military funeral which he or she has never seen , " said jarvi . whatever images may come to mind in this performance of the funeral march from the " eroica " -lrb- music from the year 1803 -rrb- , they will be just as real as any scholarly treatise . rf / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we didn ’ t quite expect that much .

listen to excerpts of the fifth symphony , with the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen . after having recently completed the cd set of the beethoven symphony cycle and given critically acclaimed performances in japan , the us and canada , paris , salzburg , and now in beethoven 's home town of bonn , have this conductor and these musicians reached a comfort zone with the music by now ? no , said jarvi : " one thing we have noticed with all those cycles and recordings , when we come back and start preparing for the cycle again , is : it does n't get easier .
sometimes you wish that it does .
sometimes you wish , ' oh my god , we 're going to spend another three hours rehearsing beethoven 's fifth symphony .
we recorded it , we played it a hundred times .
still , we have to start again and see how far we can get . " in this rendition of the final two movements from beethoven 's fifth , music from the year 1808 , " how far they get " can be measured perhaps not in inches or miles , but in light years . rf / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sometimes you wish that it does .
sometimes you wish , ' oh my god , we 're going to spend another three hours rehearsing beethoven 's fifth symphony .
we recorded it , we played it a hundred times .
still , we have to start again and see how far we can get .

4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beethoven symphony cycle requires not just virtuosity but also youth and energy .
the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi bring just that to their performance of the fourth symphony . recording and performing all nine beethoven symphonies requires some audacity , as the musicians have to come to terms not only with some of the supreme creations in the history of mankind , but also with the enormous weight of performance history .
these works entered the repertory immediately from the early 1800 's and never left it . can any new recording of the cycle make people stand up and listen ?
this one did , said paavo jarvi : " once the cd started appearing , we got a lot attention for it .
we didn ’ t quite expect that much .
because in the beginning the response was , ' what else are we going to say that hasn ’ t already been said ? '
but somehow we had enough confidence and maybe stupidity or youthful enthusiasm to go ahead with it .
and we ’ re not competing with anybody .
we just want to have ours . " thanks to the efforts of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and deutsche welle , this movement from beethoven ’ s fourth symphony , composed in 1806 , is not only theirs , but yours as well . rf / kb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining tradition and originality seems to be the recipe for success for the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi .
listen to the fourth movement of symphony no. 2 . estonian-american conductor paavo jarvi began his intensive collaboration with this group of musicians in 2004 .
roughly half the size of a traditional orchestra , it has an uncustomary seating arrangement , with first and second violins distributed equally to the left and the right , and cellos and other lower strings seated behind them .
as jarvi told dw , " this is an original seating of the orchestras of beethoven 's time . ' asked why he decided to record and perform the beethoven cycle with the musicians from bremen , he said , " i was immediately struck by the quality and energy of this orchestra .
it has an incredibly strong point of view about these symphonies , which happens to coincide with how i hear them .
i have a certain obsessive quest for details , obsessing about everything in order to try and find the truth . " this live-recorded performance of beethoven 's second symphony , composed in 1802 , is one valid version of the " truth .

3 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eroica symphony is a revolutionary opus inspired by napoleon bonaparte .
listen to parts of the third symphony performed by the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi . much has been written and said about beethoven 's third symphony , a revolutionary work from a revolutionary era .
it was inspired by napoleon bonaparte , who ignited the dreams of a generation .
maestro jarvi , however , is skeptical about the value of words when it comes to understanding a musical masterpiece of this magnitude . dw asked him to find a few words of description for each beethoven symphony . " it doesn ’ t matter how musicologically advanced you might be and how much homework we have done and how much experimentation and how much reading we have done about it : the funeral march in ' eroica ' will mean something entirely different to a 15-year old than to somebody who went through the second world war .
it will mean something different for a person who has lost their child or for a person who is just conceptionally thinking of a military funeral which he or she has never seen , " said jarvi . whatever images may come to mind in this performance of the funeral march from the " eroica " -lrb- music from the year 1803 -rrb- , they will be just as real as any scholarly treatise . rf / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .
as the victory of the democratic opposition was being announced on june 4 , 1989 , it was like a dream come true for the 10 million solidarity members who had started the long march to freedom a decade before .
unlike in other countries of central and eastern europe , where anti-communist struggle was limited to narrow groups of dissidents , a mass grassroots movement had developed in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .
it was given its first performance in 1985 in the bolshoi theater in moscow . the 36-year-old tran manh hung is among the most successful composers of his generation .
as a commission for deutsche welle , he wrote the work " le chi vien " for violin and orchestra , a " poem symphony . " the work tells the tragic story of the national hero nguyen trai , who , though innocent , was executed for regicide in 1442 together with his family .
twenty years later , nguyen was rehabilitated - but not his wife , nguyen thi lo .
violinist bui cong duy drew a picture of the beautiful thi lo with a tender , lyrical tone - perhaps a belated musical homage after nearly 600 years . program : ludwig van beethoven overture to heinrich joseph von collin ´ s “ coriolanus ” tragedy in c minor op .

3 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eroica symphony is a revolutionary opus inspired by napoleon bonaparte .
listen to parts of the third symphony performed by the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi . much has been written and said about beethoven 's third symphony , a revolutionary work from a revolutionary era .
it was inspired by napoleon bonaparte , who ignited the dreams of a generation .
maestro jarvi , however , is skeptical about the value of words when it comes to understanding a musical masterpiece of this magnitude . dw asked him to find a few words of description for each beethoven symphony . " it doesn ’ t matter how musicologically advanced you might be and how much homework we have done and how much experimentation and how much reading we have done about it : the funeral march in ' eroica ' will mean something entirely different to a 15-year old than to somebody who went through the second world war .
it will mean something different for a person who has lost their child or for a person who is just conceptionally thinking of a military funeral which he or she has never seen , " said jarvi . whatever images may come to mind in this performance of the funeral march from the " eroica " -lrb- music from the year 1803 -rrb- , they will be just as real as any scholarly treatise . rf / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : enter the world beethoven 's in the 1800s and listen to the live recording of his first symphony , performed by the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi . for the musician , performing all of beethoven 's nine symphonies in four days is an endurance test , and for the listener , a revelation .
as conductor paavo jarvi revealed to dw in an exclusive interview , " the aspect that the audience takes away from the experience is suddenly seeing a bigger picture of how the symphonies relate to one another .
hearing everything in a very concentrated , short period of time very intensely , even hearing the first three symphonies in one concert , there is a noticeable difference from the first symphony to the ' eroica . '
and for the players , one simply can not underestimate the degree of understanding and the familiarity with the text thus achieved .
you start to inhabit that world in a way that you could never do otherwise . "
we invite you to co-inhabit the world of beethoven in this nine-part podcast series , each installment with a single movement from the respective symphony , beginning with the third movement from the first symphony , dating from 1800 . rf / kb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

2 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : combining tradition and originality seems to be the recipe for success for the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi .
listen to the fourth movement of symphony no. 2 . estonian-american conductor paavo jarvi began his intensive collaboration with this group of musicians in 2004 .
roughly half the size of a traditional orchestra , it has an uncustomary seating arrangement , with first and second violins distributed equally to the left and the right , and cellos and other lower strings seated behind them .
as jarvi told dw , " this is an original seating of the orchestras of beethoven 's time . ' asked why he decided to record and perform the beethoven cycle with the musicians from bremen , he said , " i was immediately struck by the quality and energy of this orchestra .
it has an incredibly strong point of view about these symphonies , which happens to coincide with how i hear them .
i have a certain obsessive quest for details , obsessing about everything in order to try and find the truth . " this live-recorded performance of beethoven 's second symphony , composed in 1802 , is one valid version of the " truth .

4 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the beethoven symphony cycle requires not just virtuosity but also youth and energy .
the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi bring just that to their performance of the fourth symphony . recording and performing all nine beethoven symphonies requires some audacity , as the musicians have to come to terms not only with some of the supreme creations in the history of mankind , but also with the enormous weight of performance history .
these works entered the repertory immediately from the early 1800 's and never left it . can any new recording of the cycle make people stand up and listen ?
this one did , said paavo jarvi : " once the cd started appearing , we got a lot attention for it .
we didn ’ t quite expect that much .
because in the beginning the response was , ' what else are we going to say that hasn ’ t already been said ? '
but somehow we had enough confidence and maybe stupidity or youthful enthusiasm to go ahead with it .
and we ’ re not competing with anybody .
we just want to have ours . " thanks to the efforts of the deutsche kammerphilharmonie and deutsche welle , this movement from beethoven ’ s fourth symphony , composed in 1806 , is not only theirs , but yours as well . rf / kb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sometimes you wish that it does .
sometimes you wish , ' oh my god , we 're going to spend another three hours rehearsing beethoven 's fifth symphony .
we recorded it , we played it a hundred times .
still , we have to start again and see how far we can get .

6 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beethoven revolutionized the classical music of his day by adding narrative .
listen to an excerpt from symphony no .
6 , performed by the deutsche kammerphilharmonie bremen and paavo jarvi . in the " pastoral " - written in 1808 , around the time of the fifth symphony - beethoven introduced program music to the genre .
with movement headings like " scene by the brook " and " storm , " it would seem to tell a story . the composer himself , however , made a point of saying that this is music to convey a mood , not a particular situation .
our featured conductor concurs , telling dw that a specific description of the work would be too limiting : " the pastoral symphony can be taken completely as a piece of nature .
but it can also be taken completely philosophically .
this whole thing could easily be a year , or a life-cycle .
it could be about a person .
it could be a description of a day .
it could be a description of whatever .
it is my belief that it is not useful to describe music with words . " nonetheless , the listener may well be advised to seek shelter for this rendition of the " storm " movement , with an amazingly big sound from a rather small orchestra . rf / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

at the end of november , an alleged death camp guard will face the judges .
justice for nazi perpetrators is often slow , but has led to new thinking about the law . on july 14 , 1944 , 22-year-old heinrich boere and another man walked into the pharmacy owned by fritz bicknese in the southern dutch town of breda .
boere asked the pharmacist if he was bicknese .
then the ss-man is thought to have pulled out a revolver and shot the man several times . today boere lives in a nursing home in germany , but from wednesday until december 18 , the now 88-year-old will be sitting in a courtroom , answering to charges that he killed bicknese and two others .
the other of the so-called " last nazi trials " beginning this fall is that of john demjanjuk , whose alleged crimes reach another dimension entirely .
the 89-year-old retired car worker will face accusations of being a guard at the sobibor death camp in poland and helping kill almost 28,000 jews .
the simon wiesenthal center says he pushed men , women and children into the gas chambers .
both of these men are in their late 80s , which raises the question of why they were not brought to justice earlier .
boere lived openly in western germany for decades .
demjanjuk had us citizenship for years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : john demjanjuk maintains his innocence the cases illustrate how difficult it can be to prosecute crimes from this era , as the accused and witnesses alike die and evidence becomes harder to come by .
legal statutes from different countries and periods can also gum up the wheels of justice .
to many , the fact that the two men are answering for their crimes more than 60 years after the fact is an example of a legal system that is not able , or perhaps even willing , to bring all the perpetrators to justice .
in the period from 1945 to 2005 , there have been 4,964 trials regarding nazi crimes .
in many people 's eyes , that number is too low .
is justice possible ?
in fact , political philosopher hannah arendt said the crimes committed by the nazis had shattered the very foundations of justice in the western world and it was necessary to rethink what it meant to judge crime and criminality .
but edith raim , a historian at the institute for contemporary history in munich , said despite the frustration felt by many at the slow , or inadequate , wheels of justice , the german judiciary has been fairly relentless in its pursuit of nazi perpetrators .
" it 's impressive that the german justice system has been so active in this area for such a long time , even sometimes against public opinion , " she said .
" while today the public is very interested in these trials , that was n't always the case .
in the 50s , people did n't want anything to do with them , but the judiciary went ahead with prosecutions . "
german prosecutors have conducted investigations of nazi crimes every year since 1945 , unlike in other countries .
austria 's last big nazi trial took place in the mid-70s .
the us stopped its trials in 1948 , britain one year later .
nuremberg 's legacy it was the trials just after world war two , however , which garnered the most international attention and left a mark that is still being felt in jurisprudence today .
the nuremberg trials of top nazi officials , including hermann goering , captivated the world , detailing as they did the unprecedented crimes of the nazi regime .
but legal experts agree that the trials also laid a new foundation for international law , allowing for the first time a court to directly charge and punish an individual based on international law .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nuremberg trials broke new ground in the field of international law " up to that point , people had believed a national penal law was needed .
nuremberg put an end to that , saying that some deeds were so horrible that the international community had to directly intervene , " said christian tomuschat , a law professor at berlin 's humboldt university .
the trials established that humankind is , in essence , guarded by an international legal shield .
even a head of state could be held criminally responsible and punished for aggression or crimes against humanity .
however , the law limped along while atrocities in the 20th century continued - in cambodia , chile , uganda and many other places .
but the war in yugoslavia in the 1990s put new moral pressure on the international community .
it led to the establishment of international courts for that war , for the rwandan genocide , and the international criminal court .
high level of interest the trials this fall in germany also stem from still-evolving thinking about international law .
they have generated a good deal of interest in the media and among the public .
in 1969 , 70 percent of germans wanted an end to criminal prosecutions for nazi crimes .
today , calls for pulling down the curtain on this dark period of the past are scarcely heard .
the men charged , boere and demjanjuk , are elderly , so it is unclear how much time they would spend in prison if convicted .
but that does not lessen the importance of holding the trials , according to historian edith raim , who added that criminal justice has always suffered from the fact that it puts the spotlight on the perpetrator .
" the many hundred thousands of victims who were n't able to have a life often are forgotten , " she said .
" i think these trials can serve as a reminder of the immeasurable suffering these victims and their loved ones endured . "

once a pastor 's daughter from rural east germany , she learned that she had soundly defeated her rival , was now on her way to a second-term as german chancellor , and was going to build the conservative / free-market liberal governing coalition she had always wanted . " we are happy , and i am too .
we 've done something great , " she said amid raucous applause .
" we 've reached our election goal to form a stable majority in germany with a new government with the cdu , csu and fdp , and that 's a good thing . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel celebrating on election night merkel 's smile was surely one of relief at being able to jettison the uncomfortable alliance with her traditional rivals , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , and replace them with a new governing partner , the liberal free democrats , or fdp .
the business-friendly party of tax cuts and less regulation fits more closely with merkel 's own ideology than that of the left-of-center spd . and as merkel is sworn is this week for her second term , her coalition has released its plans for the next four years : large tax cuts , increases in education spending , and a bet that the german economy will rebound from its postwar-record doldrums , obviating the need for unpopular cuts in state spending . stateswoman merkel , 55 , can start her second term with considerably more confidence than she did her first .
the one-time physicist from the former east germany who , even when she became a cabinet minister in 1991 , looked distinctly uncomfortable in interviews , now seems quite at home on the world stage , hosting major gatherings such as g-8 or european union summits . while she now commands the respect of many world leaders , her high profile has also earned her the respect of many germans . " she is perceived as an almost presidential figure , " said peter matuschek of the forsa polling group . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has proved to be a competent stateswoman " she has always relied heavily on her performance on the international stage .
she has given a very statesman-like impression . " her success might seem strange to those in countries where politicians need to be bigger than life to be elected , or should have the soaring rhetoric of barack obama to motivate , the hyperactive energy of france 's nicolas sarkozy to energize , or the inspiring back story of someone like nelson mandela to inspire .
those qualities are not merkel 's strong suits . " she definitely lacks the traditional kind of charisma or she lacks some qualities of good speakers , " matuschek said .
" however , people rather seem to appreciate her coolness . " problem solver merkel is often derided as a less-than-inspiring public speaker , and it is true that her speeches contain no high-flying rhetoric or emotive outbursts to work up the crowd .
she simply lays out in calm , measured , perhaps even dull terms , her party 's platform .
her secret is meticulous preparation spiced with a dash of gentle humor .
but there is little to be heard of a grand plan for a shining future – this is pragmatic stuff , which is always what merkel has been concerned with . " she is not a big visionary .
she likes to solve the problems of today and not think about visions of the future , " said gerd langguth , a political scientist at the university of bonn who wrote a well-received biography of merkel published in 2005 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel , née kasner , grew up in the gdr merkel was born angela kasner in hamburg in 1954 to a protestant pastor and a teacher .
just weeks after her birth , her father moved the family to east germany , where he took a job .
while it is thought that her family had friendly enough relations with the communist regime , her father 's profession did raise suspicions . merkel learned to be careful , langguth said , and to think before she spoke .
she knew that to get ahead , she had to excel . " because for political reasons , she was only able to study and go to high school because she was best in her class .
this was her goal to always be the best she could be .
i would say this is the same today , " he said . too timid ? the twice-married , childless woman from the east has held her own in a party dominated by powerful family men from western germany .
but there are those who think merkel has fallen short of her best , and that the caution she learned early in life has made her too timid to make big policy decisions .
especially when it comes to reforming germany 's welfare state . michael eilfort of the market economic foundation in berlin says merkel " lacks courage " when it comes to her domestic agenda . during the last four years , her ambitions were checked by the " grand coalition " government she presided over , an uneasy partnership between merkel 's conservative union bloc and the left-of-center spd .
but eilfort and others who want to see more market-friendly reforms have complained that merkel is risk averse when it comes to unpopular moves that could alienate her domestic audience . " my impression is that ms. merkel does n't dare take needed reform steps if they are painful in the short term " he said .
" the price for that down the road will be very high . " on the other hand , it is precisely her penchant for steering a path around potential minefields – such as deeper tax reform , further labor-market or health-care reforms – that has kept her poll numbers far above those of the spd .
as the world staggers through a severe recession , there is a sense of merkel being the mother to the nation in troubled times . able to act but now that merkel has the coalition she wants , she can be somewhat more daring .
she has already agreed to slash taxes , something that her fdp coalition partners had campaigned hard on .
business leaders have praised the planned 24-billion-euro -lrb- $ 36-billion -rrb- tax cut . " growth and a republic that emphasizes education are the ideas that are foremost in our minds , as well as the solidarity of our society , " merkel said at a press conference in berlin as her coalition laid out its priorities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tax cuts and education are two priorities of the new coalition " this new government is keeping its word .
we are not going to increase taxes or paycheck deductions , instead we are focusing on growth and providing relief to our citizens . " that will appeal to many , especially those who are worried about the current financial crisis .
many seem to have faith in merkel and her business-friendly coalition partners to keep germany from being hit too hard by the global financial upheaval . " the chancellor is leading the poor and anxious germans out of the crisis like moses through the red sea , " said gero neugebauer , a political scientist at berlin 's free university . but she 's got her work cut out of her .
the tax cut comes at a time when germany 's finances are not in great shape , and she has come under criticism from some in her own party .
spiraling debt levels might force her to cut state spending , which could anger voters .
and she 's expected to start a health care reform drive which has always proven to be a minefield in germany . but on election night , she had words of comfort , not confrontation . " i 'd like to tell the people in this country , i have always wanted to be and continue to want to be the chancellor for all germans , " she told the crowd .
" so that our country does better , especially in a crisis such as we are experiencing now . " it was certainly a sweet moment for the woman who was once patronizingly called " the girl " by her political mentor .
this " girl " has become , according to forbes magazine , the most powerful woman on the planet . author : kyle james editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a captivating city as dw correspondent arpad szoczi knows very well . i first got to know hungary and hungarians from thousands of kilometers away , growing up in toronto , canada .
i was listening to the stories of my father , a hungarian political refugee who escaped from his home country in 1952 .
then later in life i became a hungarian and eventually bought a home in budapest .
living part of my life now in the hungarian capital , i see that some of the tumultuous times my father described to me still exist .
fortunately , other things make up for it .
i 'll never forget covering a wild anti-government demonstration as a reporter in budapest in october of 2006 .
hundreds of rioters had stormed the main public broadcaster 's tv building , and then later had closed down and barricaded one of the main bridges connecting buda and pest .
as for me , i had to go to an eye clinic because i had developed an outrageous eye infection after being tear-gassed so much .
bildunterschrift : arpad szoczi feels right at home in his ancestral city the political climate remains vitriolic today .
fortunately , none of that can change what i love the most – the city .
for me , there is nothing in this world that equals being on the banks of the danube river between buda and pest on a boat-restaurant on a beautiful summer evening sipping a glass of tokaji and reveling in the surroundings .
and i can safely say that about the hungarian capital after having been to four continents … i still revel in the city 's amazing architecture that is especially apparent on classy andrassy street with its addictive coffee houses .
and you can get a quick history lesson of the country by simply going to heroes ' square .
as one romanian tourist surveying the area once told me , " you can see here that they used to rule an empire . "
getting around budapest via the subway is the best way to go to avoid the constant budapest traffic jams .
the joke in the hilly half of the capital – buda – is that the moment any drops of rain fall , traffic there grinds to a halt .
sometimes , if i want to escape the hustle-and-bustle , i go to the wonderful oasis right on the danube called margaret island .
i usually go for a swim in the huge public pool there , but sometimes just a nice walk will do the trick .
before i know it , it 's already nightfall .
and that 's when i can appreciate the unusual talent that hungarians have – they are incredibly musical .
that 's partly because music is a compulsory subject in schools for much longer than in other countries .
everyone seems to be able to play something .
so , i try whenever i can to check out a hungarian concert – be it pop or classical .
and now looking back on my own life , i understand why my father still pined half-a-century later for his homeland .

but in fact , the dismantling of the system started in poland some 10 years before with the founding of solidarity . in 1979 , the first visit home by polish-born pope john paul ii gave ordinary poles the courage to face up to their rulers .
a year later , eastern europe 's first free trade union solidarity was born .
the communists soon clamped down by imposing martial law , but the spirit of solidarity lived on .
in june 1989 , poles overwhelmingly voted for democracy in the first partly free elections .
as the victory of the democratic opposition was being announced on june 4 , 1989 , it was like a dream come true for the 10 million solidarity members who had started the long march to freedom a decade before .
unlike in other countries of central and eastern europe , where anti-communist struggle was limited to narrow groups of dissidents , a mass grassroots movement had developed in poland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers at the gdansk shipyards formed the eastern bloc 's first independent trade union " it was a movement which came from below , " said solidarity sociologist marek garztecki .
" obviously , there were intellectuals who were helping to formulate programs , especially in later stages .
but i believe that solidarity was the first true embodiment of the concept of civil society . "
the speed of change took everyone by surprise , including ryszard bugaj , one of the key opposition figures .
" in mid-1988 , i was still convinced that i would forever remain a dissident , " said bugaj , now an advisor to the polish president .
" to me , it was amazing that the elections were allowed to take place .
it was plain and simple : there was no turning back . "
the policy of a " thick line " but as the country blazed the trail for others in the region , solidarity had to tread carefully .
the communists were still in power in the kremlin , with 50,000 soviet troops stationed in poland .
at a historic round table meeting in warsaw in the spring of 1989 , solidarity and the communists struck a power-sharing deal that paved the way for the elections .
a third of the seats in the lower house of parliament were freely contested , plus all the seats in the senate .
the communists and their allies were to automatically fill the rest of the seats .
one of the solidarity leaders bronislaw geremek made it clear that the movement was prepared to honor the deal in the election results .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bronislaw geremek went on to become polish foreign minister before his death in 2008 .
" solidarity is ready to support policies geared toward reform and changes of the political system , " geremek said at the time .
" this marks the beginning of a political process , which we have long been working for . "
but to some poles , the deal seemed controversial .
in a recently released documentary , solidarity leaders including geremek can be heard pledging not to prosecute former communists , no matter what evidence of their past wrongdoings came up .
this later came to be known as the policy of a " thick line " to make a clean break with the past .
those who negotiated the deal said this was to allow everyone a fresh start in a new poland .
however , critics like nationalist christian democratic politician wieslaw chrzanowski maintain that it was a sell-out .
" to all intents and purposes solidarity allowed the communists to keep much of their influence , " chrzanowski said .
" to me , the deal was unhealthy .
either you have completely free elections or you do n't .
solidarity agreed to take all the responsibility , while the former communist bosses were free to pursue their business interests . "
was polish democracy distorted ?
as poland 's first non-communist prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki was being sworn in on september 10 , 1989 , he told parliament his cabinet would represent all poles - irrespective of their political views .
mazowiecki 's government was enthusiastically received .
even though it had to quickly introduce a set of painful market reforms to stop the economy from collapsing , it still enjoyed strong popular support .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tadeusz mazowiecki 's government helped open poland to the west .
" tadeusz mazowiecki did a very difficult job very well and one has to give his government credit for a great deal , " historian adam zamojski said .
" the economic reforms were extraordinary .
the amazing energy kept the country cohesive and prevented anarchy from breaking out , or what could turn into a nasty lot of arguments . "
on the 20th anniversary of solidarity 's victory , there were those who said that mazowiecki should have done more to bring the former communists to account .
critics said that the power-sharing deal with the communists distorted polish democracy .
but most commentators agree that the critics largely ignore the european realities of the day .
after all , when the first democratic polish government was being inaugurated , the berlin wall was still standing .

metamorphosis means change , transformation and , in the end , the creation of something new . ” and something new is created every year at the beethovenfest as well : old compositions are played in new interpretations , new ones are premiered , and the new joins with the old – a metamorphosis and a new beginning .

boere has admitted to killing three dutch resistance fighters . at the opening of the trial in the western german town of aachen on wednesday , boere 's lawyers , gordon christiansen and matthias rahmlow , filed a motion demanding that the state prosecutor , ulrich maass , be replaced .
the defense accused maass of showing emotional bias in media interviews he has given since he re-opened the boere case in 2008 .
speaking to dutch broadcaster nl1 in september , maass said , “ there must be a conviction , whether he shows regret or not .
that will not change the severity of the punishment . ”
he was also accused of divulging confidential information about the accused to the media .
german law requires that prosecutors strive to be objective and discreet when a trial is pending .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : teun de groot , the son of one of boere 's victims , was at the court the judge ruled that the case can not continue until maass gives a clear response to the accusations .
maass did not have a response ready but said he would prepare one by monday when the case resumes .
sheltered from justice although wednesday 's decision is a setback for the prosecution , bringing boere to court at all represents a victory in itself .
in 2008 , several german courts ruled that boere could not stand trial in germany because of his advanced age .
maass subsequently appealed those rulings and won .
relatives of boere 's victims were present in court .
boere -lrb- 88 -rrb- is on trial in connection with the killings of three dutch resistance fighters during world war ii while a member of a special ss unit named ‘ silver pine ' , tasked with hunting down the resistance in holland .
boere confessed to his crimes while in allied custody after the war but escaped to germany before a dutch court could try him .
that court eventually convicted him in his absence .
years of legal wrangling between germany and the netherlands left boere living his life a free man in germany .
in april 2008 , he admitted to the german news magazine focus that he had committed the shootings .
in a later interview with another publication , der spiegel , he said he had been following orders which he had sworn to obey .
bildunterschrift : boere joined the waffen-ss shortly after holland 's capitulation the dutch-born boere was 18 when he joined the waffen ss in 1940 , just months after holland fell to germany .
he served on the eastern front for two years before returning to holland and being assigned to the 15-man ss hit squad in 1942 .
long wait martin bicknese , the grandson of one of boere 's victims , told deutsche welle this week that he was happy the former ss man would finally stand trial after living free for so many years .
“ he was at home and he lived a good life , and now , finally , he will come before a judge .
for my family , this is a good thing , ” bicknese said .
if on monday the judge decides that maass is not objective enough , one of maass ' colleagues is to take over the prosecution . the case is set to last two months .
maass is expected to do whatever he can to stay in charge , as his key witness , an accomplice in one of the 1944 murders , is scheduled to testify that morning .

on wednesday , the bundestag is to meet to re-elect merkel as chancellor . lammert used the first speech of his second term as bundestag president to call for a host of improvements to the parliament 's protocol , as well as a one-year extension to the legislative period .
lammert pointed to statistics suggesting that german voters felt they had too many elections , and suggested holding general elections every five years , rather than every four .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lammert called for reforms in his inaugural speech lammert , who was re-elected for this term with a slightly reduced majority of 84.6 percent , also called on representatives not to saddle the parliament with unnecessary work , and " self-critically check " the resolutions and initiatives they planned . he encouraged parliamentarians to be more self-confident .
" the bundestag is not a support-organ , but the heart of the formation of our country 's political will , " he told representatives .
spd relegated to the back the seating arrangements in the new parliament did offer a startling image of how german politics changed in the september 27 vote .
merkel 's grand coalition partners in the last government , the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , were devastated by the election , seeing their representation in the bundestag drop from 221 deputies to 146 .
this has forced the spd to give up two of its highly-prized front row seats in the bundestag , and leading figures in the grand coalition government , like former finance minister peer steinbrueck , have now been relegated to the distant back rows .
on wednesday , lammert is to chair a meeting in which the bundestag is to re-elect chancellor merkel at the head of new coalition government made up of her christian democrats and the liberal free democrats . bk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the past , there have been orchestras from ukraine , turkey , georgia , china , poland , south africa , egypt and russia .
this year , vietnam was chosen - a selection anticipating the german-vietnamese year of culture that the two governments will celebrate in 2010 to mark 35 years of diplomatic relations . a campus concert always includes a symphony by beethoven , a work from the musicians ' homeland and the first performance of a work by a young composer from the selected country , commissioned by deutsche welle . the concert opened with the coriolan overture , which ludwig van beethoven wrote in 1807 for the tragedy " coriolan " by the austrian dramatist heinrich joseph von collin .
the play has long since been forgotten , but the overture is part of the standard concert repertoire . musical impressions from vietnam do hong quan , an established composer who is currently chairman of the vietnamese composers ' association , wrote the " rhapsody of vietnam , " a luxuriant tone picture of landscapes , dances and festivities in four movements .

as a commission for deutsche welle , he wrote the work " le chi vien " for violin and orchestra , a " poem symphony . " the work tells the tragic story of the national hero nguyen trai , who , though innocent , was executed for regicide in 1442 together with his family .

european commission president jose manuel barroso said the eu is prepared to offer up to 50 billion euros -lrb- $ 74 billion -rrb- in public funds to aid developing nations in reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
" we can now look the rest of the world in the eyes and say we europeans have done our job , " said barroso at the summit 's closing press conference .
" it was essential that the european union kept its leadership role , and we have done that . "
anticipation is building around the world ahead of the copenhagen summit , which is to seek to find a successor to the kyoto protocol , the anti-climate change treaty that expires in 2012 .
particular attention is on the united states , a heavy polluter that did not participate in the kyoto agreement , and rapidly industrializing nations like china and india .
who will foot the bill ?
the details of which countries would pay for the aid were not immediately available .
earlier reports said a split between western and eastern european nations on who would pay for the aid could threaten the bloc 's ability to reach a compromise .
developing nations will need about 100 billion euros a year by 2020 in order to effectively tackle climate change , said prime minister fredrik reinfeldt of sweden , which currently holds the eu 's rotating presidency .
he also said eu member states would not be required to contribute to the aid before 2013 , in an apparent concession to the bloc 's less affluent countries .
poland joined eight other eastern eu states in opposing the idea of linking each country 's contribution to its own level of greenhouse gas emissions .
instead it suggested sharing the cost according to gross national income .
the dispute has not yet been resolved .
" we do n't think you can make an assumption that bulgaria or romania will pay more thank denmark or the netherlands because it would be purely absurd , " said polish eu affairs minister mikolaj dowgielewicz .
lisbon treaty gets a boost bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opposition to the lisbon treaty remains in the czech republic the brussels summit also bore good news for the lisbon reform treaty when members agreed to an opt-out for the czech republic on a human rights charter .
czech president vaclav klaus had withheld support for the treaty until he secured the exemption .
the czech government had voiced concerns over the possibility that the charter would allow ethnic germans expelled after world war ii to sue prague for lost property .
klaus said in a statement that he accepted the summit 's decision " with satisfaction , " and that he would not further block the treaty 's ratification .
the czech republic is the only country that has not yet ratified the treaty , which would create a high-profile eu presidency to increase the bloc 's global influence and streamline decision making .
a decision on who will get the new post was put off until another meeting .
the last remaining hurdle lies with the czech constitutional court , which is scheduled to rule on a legal challenge to the treaty next tuesday. acb / dpa / ap / reuters / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in eight concerts , six interpreters played all 32 of beethoven 's piano sonatas the first concert in the series was given by andrea lucchesini in the beethoven-haus in bonn .
the italian pianist is not among the fortepiano specialists in the historical performance scene .
for his concert , he played both on a fortepiano - a copy of an instrument built in 1824 by the piano maker conrad graf - and a steinway grand .
the latter was not used for beethoven 's music , but for a piano sonata by the composer luciano berio , who died six years ago ; lucchesini premiered the piece in zurich in 2001 . with and without the fortepiano : historical and modern instruments in this concert , two different worlds of piano sound confronted each other to great effect .
in the sonata in f-sharp major , op. 78 , lucchesini made the fortepiano sing with his tender , expressive playing .
the conductor hans von buelow said once of the four-bar adagio introduction to this piece : " if beethoven had written nothing else but these four bars , he would be immortal . " the change to the steinway grand for berio 's piano sonata came almost as a shock .
new tone colors and sounds filled the room , and the volume and explosive dynamics of the modern grand piano seemed to overshadow the intimacy of the fortepiano .
but this intimacy returned with beethoven 's " hammerklavier " sonata , the most radical and innovative work of the sonata cycle at the time of its composition .
when beethoven , by this time almost completely deaf , composed it in 1817/18 , he told his pupil carl czerny : " i am writing a sonata that is to be my greatest . "
many pianists still stand in fear of the final movement , in which beethoven shows no consideration for the fact that a pianist has only two hands to cope with its technical demands . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 24 in f-sharp minor op. 78 piano sonata no. 29 in b-flat major op. 106 -lrb- " hammerklavier sonata " -rrb- luciano berio piano sonata performed by : andrea lucchesini -lrb- piano , fortepiano -rrb- performed on september 14 , 2009 in the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . norbert hornig / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

for the first time , a keyboard instrument became capable of being played not just loudly or softly , but with a wide range of dynamic nuances .
beethoven used this as an opportunity to experiment with new expressive possibilities on the piano . " in his music , beethoven always tried to take things to the limit : not just the formal limit , but also the limit of the instruments available to him , " ronald brautigam said in an interview with dw . like beethoven , brautigam - the " king of that strange period beast , the fortepiano , " as the times once called him - went to the limits of what the fortepiano has to offer .
he gave a spirited , fearless account of the " waldstein " sonata , with glistening , seemingly endless chains of trills and glissandi .

among the highlights of the cycle were the two concerts given by the dutch pianist ronald brautigam , who is currently working on a complete recording of the beethoven sonatas and is extremely conversant with the tonal possibilities offered by the fortepiano . even in the composer 's three early sonatas -lrb- op .
2 -rrb- , ronald brautigam made it extremely apparent how finely shaded and subtle beethoven 's music sounds on the fortepiano , quickly calling into question cherished listening habits : beethoven played with the richness of sound produced by a modern concert grand .
it was with these pieces that beethoven , who had initially created a sensation in vienna as a pianist and improviser , presented himself in 1795 for the first time as a composer of piano sonatas as well .
he dedicated them to joseph haydn , who had taught him in 1793 and was present at their first performance . even the dramatically forceful " pathetique " sounded unexpectedly transparent and intriguing on the seemingly fragile fortepiano .
listeners familiar with portraits of beethoven thought they saw a certain resemblance between the composer and his interpreter , ronald brautigam . program : ludwig van beethoven piano sonata no. 1 in f minor op. 2/1 piano sonata no. 2 in a major op. 2/2 piano sonata no. 3 in c major op. 2/3 piano sonata no. 8 in c minor op. 13 , “ pathetique ” performed by : robert brautigam , fortepiano performed on september 23 , 2009 at the beethoven-haus bonn and recorded by deutsche welle . marita berg / gz / kjb send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

opposition and non-government circles have reacted with alarm . niebel told a german newspaper that economic powers like china and india , commonly referred to as " developing nations , " no longer met the criteria of that distinction .
" battling poverty is more important than ever .
that means we have to concentrate our resources effectively in the most needy areas .
economic giants like china and india do n't belong to these , " he told the mass-circulation daily bild zeitung .
niebel , meanwhile , did not provide any details on when the 70 million euros -lrb- $ 103 million -rrb- of annual aid to china would be discontinued .
change in policy the push to discontinue the economic assistance reflects a change in the germany 's general development aid policy .
niebel 's party , the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- went into coalition talks with angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- with the explicit wish of merging the development ministry with the foreign ministry .
the combination of the two ministries , the party said , would establish a german foreign policy with " one voice . "
meanwhile , the opposition has reacted with alarm to the fdp being at the head of the development ministry .
social democrat spokesman sascha rabbe called niebel 's appointment as development minister a " bad joke . "
" it 's nothing short of ridiculous that the people who were trying to dissolve the development ministry have now put one of their own at the head of it .
it looks now like niebel will turn the development ministry into a liquidation ministry , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are perplexed at the naming of niebel as development minister broken promises ?
criticism also come from development groups .
claudia warning , head of the german federation of non-governmental organizations active in development cooperation , venro , has said the new government 's international policy disregards commitments germany has already made regarding development aid .
" the government is simply not recognizing all international agreements and time frameworks it has ratified in the past on increasing its official development aid , " ips news agency quoted her as saying .
warning said the new government 's program put too much emphasis on " promoting german economic interests abroad . "
the ministry 's task was to " contribute to the international fight against poverty , and not the promotion of german business interests , " she said .
germany 's previous government had pledged to raise its official development aid to over 0.5 percent of gdp by 2010 and 0.7 percent by 2015 .
the fdp , meanwhile , has rejected claims that the new government will decrease its contributions to developing nations .
it says , on the contrary , that it is looking for ways to step up the fight against global poverty. glb / ips / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a nato report on the incident said the death toll is uncertain . general wolfgang schneiderhan , the general inspector of the german armed forces , or bundeswehr , told reporters on thursday that he had seen a classified nato report prepared on an airstrike on hijacked trucks and came to the conclusion that the controversial order was " appropriate . "
on september 4 , colonel georg klein summoned us air support to destroy two fuel tankers which had been hijacked by the taliban a few kilometers from a german base in northern afghanistan .
villagers said that the bombs also killed civilians who were stealing fuel from the trucks which had become stranded in a river bed .
" i see no grounds to doubt that they acted appropriately , " schneiderhan said of the officers involved .
casualty figures according to the nato report , it is no longer possible to determine an exact number of those killed .
different sources report widely different casualty numbers - between 17 and 142 people .
the report says there could have been between 30 and 40 civilians killed or wounded in the incident .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : colonel georg klein the report was compiled by officers of the international security assistance force -lrb- isaf -rrb- in afghanistan and flown to germany on wednesday .
schneiderhan warned against seeing the incident in isolation , but as one of numerous taliban attacks on isaf forces in northern afghanistan , klein 's area of responsibility .

the moves ordered by prime minister yulia tymoshenko came after the country confirmed at least four swine flu-related deaths , ukraine 's first since the outbreak started in mexico and the united states last april .
the government is also to implement a " special system " to limit unnecessary travel .

he had loaned the party hundreds of thousands of euros over the last few years . rieger suffered a stroke last weekend , and died on thursday at a berlin hospital .
he was 63 .
the hamburg lawyer was vice president of the far-right , anti-immigrant national democratic party of germany -lrb- npd -rrb- and the chairman of its hamburg branch .
rieger 's family , which did not share his views , told germany 's dpa news agency that they were considering burial at sea or cremation and then scattering the ashes to prevent his grave from becoming a pilgrimage site for the extreme right .
rieger 's son harald said they were planning a private funeral .
rieger was known for having many contacts within the neo-nazi scene and with leading extreme rightists in scandinavia .
he also defended several high-ranking extremists in court .
" he was a neo-nazi without any question , " olaf sundermeyer , a journalist and npd expert , told deutsche welle .
" juergen rieger was one of the best known representatives of this hooligan front , this neo-nazi front of the national democratic party of germany . "
sundermeyer said his death would have a serious impact on the day-to-day operations of the party .
" he was the only person that actually had money within the npd .
he owned a lot of property in the hamburg area , and he gave loans to the npd .
the question is whether his four children demand to get this money back , " sundermeyer said .
an inheritance of debt ?
the party has been plagued with financial problems in recent years .
the npd had to pay back 1.27 million euros -lrb- $ 1.89 million -rrb- in public campaign funds to the german government after a former treasurer was charged with embezzling over 700,000 euros in 2008 .
the head of the hamburg office for the protection of the constitution , heino vahldieck , called reiger 's death a significant blow for the npd and far-right organizations in germany .
" he was for a long time a beacon -as much for his biography as for his financial contributions , " vahldieck told the associated press .
according to dpa , rieger leaves behind an estimated fortune of 500,000 euros .
it 's not yet known if rieger left any money to the party in his will .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rieger had many contacts within the militant neo-nazi wing of the npd who 's next ?
sundermeyer says that rieger 's death could set off a power-struggle within the npd , between the militant neo-nazis and those in the party who play down its connections to the hitler-era .
" now that he 's dead , the big question will be which of these wings will dominate the npd in the future , " sundermeyer said .
in recent years , rieger had been trying to buy derelict hotels , guest houses , and cinemas for use as " training centers " for the far-right .
his attempts set off a flurry of citizen protests and counter-offers from the municipal governments .
hans-werner schlitte , the mayor of a town where rieger was trying to buy an empty country hotel , said on friday that the community felt not so strongly under pressure since his death .

for the first time in its history , users will be allowed to create full web and e-mail-addresses using non-latin characters .
the change has been announced by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- at its board meeting taking place in seoul , south korea .
according to supporters of the change , it marks a huge technological shift in the way the web works with the potential to open up access to millions of new users .
until now , anyone wanting to set up a website has been forced to include a few characters of latin script in the address , or domain name , that they choose .
born in the usa other scripts , arabic or japanese for example , can be used in the first part , but whatever language is used , the address must end with a small but very important collection of latin alphabet characters , .com , .gov , .co.uk , .cn and so on .
without those latin letters on the end , the website simply will not work .
the reason for the system is simple - the internet was born in the united states .
not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language rod beckstrom , icann president and the latin-script suffixes used in web-addresses have now become so internationally familiar that some internet users question the need for change .
but imagine the situation in reverse .
what if every european or north american website was forced to include a few letters of chinese in its domain name ?
wide world icann 's president , rod beckstrom , believes the change will help remove an inbuilt cultural bias at the heart of the internet 's infrastructure .
" it may not be that important to you and me because we grew up in latin-based languages , " he tells me .
" but for other people who grew up in china , india or korea , or many other places using different scripts , not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language . "
just down the road from where the icann board is meeting here in central seoul , i caught up with a group of korean pensioners , learning how to use the internet at an adult education centre .
sixty-four-year-old park seung-ja is struggling .
" it 's so inconvenient and cumbersome having to keep switching to the western keyboard , " she tells me .
" i 'm having to go back decades to remember the english i learnt at school . "
there are already some workarounds in countries like korea with high internet use .
language ghetto ?
using search engines in the local script allows users to find web-addresses without typing the name , and there are programs that allow users to enter addresses in their own language .
the technology is recognisable around the world , but not all the words but it does not work on all computers , or for all websites , and many people believe there is an important principle at stake .
lee dong-bum , chief executive of a small korean consulting firm , says he thinks he might be losing some customers who are unable to find him online .
" my customers should be able to find my company in their own language , " he says .
" this is the only fair way for access to the internet to be arranged . "
the change to multiple-language scripts though has not been without its critics .
there are those who worry that it might lead to a kind of ghettoisation of the internet , with language communities operating entirely within their own languages cut off from the rest of the web .
there are worries too that it will make the protection of intellectual property rights that much harder .
but the first step along the road will be a relatively small one .
at first , the change will only apply to the lesser-used group of domains known as the country codes .
these are the web addresses with endings like .uk , .cn , or .kr , for the united kingdom , china , and south korea for example , and their assignment is guided by government rules in each country .
icann says it will begin accepting the first applications for these addresses , in a number of different scripts other than latin , from 16 november .
eventually , all domain names should be available in multi-languages .
when that happens , supporters say , the world wide web , will finally live up to its name .

for the first time in its history , users will be allowed to create full web and e-mail-addresses using non-latin characters .
the change has been announced by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- at its board meeting taking place in seoul , south korea .
according to supporters of the change , it marks a huge technological shift in the way the web works with the potential to open up access to millions of new users .
until now , anyone wanting to set up a website has been forced to include a few characters of latin script in the address , or domain name , that they choose .
born in the usa other scripts , arabic or japanese for example , can be used in the first part , but whatever language is used , the address must end with a small but very important collection of latin alphabet characters , .com , .gov , .co.uk , .cn and so on .
without those latin letters on the end , the website simply will not work .
the reason for the system is simple - the internet was born in the united states .
not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language rod beckstrom , icann president and the latin-script suffixes used in web-addresses have now become so internationally familiar that some internet users question the need for change .
but imagine the situation in reverse .
what if every european or north american website was forced to include a few letters of chinese in its domain name ?
wide world icann 's president , rod beckstrom , believes the change will help remove an inbuilt cultural bias at the heart of the internet 's infrastructure .
" it may not be that important to you and me because we grew up in latin-based languages , " he tells me .
" but for other people who grew up in china , india or korea , or many other places using different scripts , not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language . "
just down the road from where the icann board is meeting here in central seoul , i caught up with a group of korean pensioners , learning how to use the internet at an adult education centre .
sixty-four-year-old park seung-ja is struggling .
" it 's so inconvenient and cumbersome having to keep switching to the western keyboard , " she tells me .
" i 'm having to go back decades to remember the english i learnt at school . "
there are already some workarounds in countries like korea with high internet use .
language ghetto ?
using search engines in the local script allows users to find web-addresses without typing the name , and there are programs that allow users to enter addresses in their own language .
the technology is recognisable around the world , but not all the words but it does not work on all computers , or for all websites , and many people believe there is an important principle at stake .
lee dong-bum , chief executive of a small korean consulting firm , says he thinks he might be losing some customers who are unable to find him online .
" my customers should be able to find my company in their own language , " he says .
" this is the only fair way for access to the internet to be arranged . "
the change to multiple-language scripts though has not been without its critics .
there are those who worry that it might lead to a kind of ghettoisation of the internet , with language communities operating entirely within their own languages cut off from the rest of the web .
there are worries too that it will make the protection of intellectual property rights that much harder .
but the first step along the road will be a relatively small one .
at first , the change will only apply to the lesser-used group of domains known as the country codes .
these are the web addresses with endings like .uk , .cn , or .kr , for the united kingdom , china , and south korea for example , and their assignment is guided by government rules in each country .
icann says it will begin accepting the first applications for these addresses , in a number of different scripts other than latin , from 16 november .
eventually , all domain names should be available in multi-languages .
when that happens , supporters say , the world wide web , will finally live up to its name .

what if every european or north american website was forced to include a few letters of chinese in its domain name ?
wide world icann 's president , rod beckstrom , believes the change will help remove an inbuilt cultural bias at the heart of the internet 's infrastructure .
" it may not be that important to you and me because we grew up in latin-based languages , " he tells me .
" but for other people who grew up in china , india or korea , or many other places using different scripts , not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language . "
just down the road from where the icann board is meeting here in central seoul , i caught up with a group of korean pensioners , learning how to use the internet at an adult education centre .
sixty-four-year-old park seung-ja is struggling .
" it 's so inconvenient and cumbersome having to keep switching to the western keyboard , " she tells me .
" i 'm having to go back decades to remember the english i learnt at school . "
there are already some workarounds in countries like korea with high internet use .
language ghetto ?
using search engines in the local script allows users to find web-addresses without typing the name , and there are programs that allow users to enter addresses in their own language .
the technology is recognisable around the world , but not all the words but it does not work on all computers , or for all websites , and many people believe there is an important principle at stake .
lee dong-bum , chief executive of a small korean consulting firm , says he thinks he might be losing some customers who are unable to find him online .
" my customers should be able to find my company in their own language , " he says .
" this is the only fair way for access to the internet to be arranged . "
the change to multiple-language scripts though has not been without its critics .
there are those who worry that it might lead to a kind of ghettoisation of the internet , with language communities operating entirely within their own languages cut off from the rest of the web .
there are worries too that it will make the protection of intellectual property rights that much harder .
but the first step along the road will be a relatively small one .
at first , the change will only apply to the lesser-used group of domains known as the country codes .
these are the web addresses with endings like .uk , .cn , or .kr , for the united kingdom , china , and south korea for example , and their assignment is guided by government rules in each country .
icann says it will begin accepting the first applications for these addresses , in a number of different scripts other than latin , from 16 november .
eventually , all domain names should be available in multi-languages .
when that happens , supporters say , the world wide web , will finally live up to its name .

for the first time in its history , users will be allowed to create full web and e-mail-addresses using non-latin characters .
the change has been announced by the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- at its board meeting taking place in seoul , south korea .
according to supporters of the change , it marks a huge technological shift in the way the web works with the potential to open up access to millions of new users .
until now , anyone wanting to set up a website has been forced to include a few characters of latin script in the address , or domain name , that they choose .
born in the usa other scripts , arabic or japanese for example , can be used in the first part , but whatever language is used , the address must end with a small but very important collection of latin alphabet characters , .com , .gov , .co.uk , .cn and so on .
without those latin letters on the end , the website simply will not work .
the reason for the system is simple - the internet was born in the united states . "
not only is it an issue of convenience , but it 's an issue of what 's right , the right to express their names in their own cultural language " rod beckstrom , icann president and the latin-script suffixes used in web-addresses have now become so internationally familiar that some internet users question the need for change .

more than half of the 1.6 billion people who use the internet speak languages with non-latin scripts .
it is being described as the biggest change to the way the internet works since it was created 40 years ago .
the first internationalised domain names -lrb- idns -rrb- could be in use next year .
plans for idns were first approved at a meeting in june 2008 , but testing of the system has been going on for two years .
technical upheaval the move paves the way for the internet 's domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- to be changed so it can recognise and translate non-latin characters .
the dns acts like a phonebook , turning easily understood domain names into strings of computer-readable numbers , known as internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses . "

icann said it would accept the first applications for idns by 16 november , with the first up and running by " mid-2010 " .
it is likely the majority of early non-latin net addresses to be approved will be in chinese and arabic script , followed by russian .
some countries , such as china and thailand , have already introduced workarounds that allow computer users to enter web addresses in their own language .
however , these were not internationally approved and do not work on all computers .
autonomy our correspondent says the point of the icann vote was to create a universal internet address code that will work in any language and every place so all the world 's computers can connect with each other .

" so this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread . "
icann , set up by the us government , was founded in 1998 to oversee the development of the net .
last month , after years of criticism , the us government eased its control over the non-profit body .
it signed a new agreement that gave icann autonomy for the first time .
the agreement came into effect on 1 october and puts it under the scrutiny of the global " internet community " .

icann president rod beckstrom : " it 's really momentous " the internet regulator has approved plans to allow non-latin-script web addresses , in a move that is set to transform the online world .
the board of icann voted at its annual meeting in seoul to allow domain names in arabic , chinese and other scripts .
more than half of the 1.6 billion people who use the internet speak languages with non-latin scripts .
it is being described as the biggest change to the way the internet works since it was created 40 years ago .
the first internationalised domain names -lrb- idns -rrb- could be in use next year .
plans for idns were first approved at a meeting in june 2008 , but testing of the system has been going on for two years .
technical upheaval the move paves the way for the internet 's domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- to be changed so it can recognise and translate non-latin characters .
the dns acts like a phonebook , turning easily understood domain names into strings of computer-readable numbers , known as internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses .
this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread rod beckstrom president of icann a truly world wide web at last read your comments the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- said the " fantastically complicated technical feature " allowing idns would represent the " biggest change " to the coding that underlies the internet since it was invented four decades ago .
bbc technology correspondent mark gregory says in the early days of the internet , language posed no problem , as most web-surfers spoke english and those that did not usually wrote in languages based on the latin alphabet .
but this is no longer true , adds our correspondent .
icann said it would accept the first applications for idns by 16 november , with the first up and running by " mid-2010 " .
it is likely the majority of early non-latin net addresses to be approved will be in chinese and arabic script , followed by russian .
some countries , such as china and thailand , have already introduced workarounds that allow computer users to enter web addresses in their own language .
however , these were not internationally approved and do not work on all computers .
autonomy our correspondent says the point of the icann vote was to create a universal internet address code that will work in any language and every place so all the world 's computers can connect with each other .
have your say there is a danger that the internet - a tool for culture , information - sharing and dialog on a non-national level , may become irreversibly fragmented stefanos likkas , athens , greece send us your comments " of the 1.6 billion internet users today worldwide , more than half use languages that have scripts that are not latin-based , " said icann president and ceo rod beckstrom earlier this week .
" so this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread . "
icann , set up by the us government , was founded in 1998 to oversee the development of the net .
last month , after years of criticism , the us government eased its control over the non-profit body .
it signed a new agreement that gave icann autonomy for the first time .
the agreement came into effect on 1 october and puts it under the scrutiny of the global " internet community " .

icann president rod beckstrom : " it 's really momentous " the internet regulator has approved plans to allow non-latin-script web addresses , in a move that is set to transform the online world .
the board of icann voted at its annual meeting in seoul to allow domain names in arabic , chinese and other scripts .
more than half of the 1.6 billion people who use the internet speak languages with non-latin scripts .
it is being described as the biggest change to the way the internet works since it was created 40 years ago .
the first internationalised domain names -lrb- idns -rrb- could be in use next year .
plans for idns were first approved at a meeting in june 2008 , but testing of the system has been going on for two years .
technical upheaval the move paves the way for the internet 's domain name system -lrb- dns -rrb- to be changed so it can recognise and translate non-latin characters .
the dns acts like a phonebook , turning easily understood domain names into strings of computer-readable numbers , known as internet protocol -lrb- ip -rrb- addresses .
this change is very much necessary for not only half the world 's internet users today but more than half , probably , of the future users as the internet continues to spread rod beckstrom president of icann a truly world wide web at last read your comments the internet corporation for assigned names and numbers -lrb- icann -rrb- said the " fantastically complicated technical feature " allowing idns would represent the " biggest change " to the coding that underlies the internet since it was invented four decades ago .
bbc technology correspondent mark gregory says in the early days of the internet , language posed no problem , as most web-surfers spoke english and those that did not usually wrote in languages based on the latin alphabet .
but this is no longer true , adds our correspondent .
icann said it would accept the first applications for idns by 16 november , with the first up and running by " mid-2010 " .
it is likely the majority of early non-latin net addresses to be approved will be in chinese and arabic script , followed by russian .
some countries , such as china and thailand , have already introduced workarounds that allow computer users to enter web addresses in their own language .
however , these were not internationally approved and do not work on all computers .
autonomy our correspondent says the point of the icann vote was to create a universal internet address code that will work in any language and every place so all the world 's computers can connect with each other .
have your say there is a danger that the internet - a tool for culture , information - sharing and dialog on a non-national level , may become irreversibly fragmented stefanos likkas , athens , greece send us your comments " of the 1.6 billion internet users today worldwide , more than half use languages that have scripts that are not latin-based , " said icann president and ceo rod beckstrom earlier this week .

bbc london marks 1,000 days to go until the 2012 games with a series of personal films by some those who believe they will gain or lose out .
winner kieran shekoni is a talented 19-year old from clapham who enjoys producing music .
as a former fulham junior player , he also likes a kick about with his friends .
after leaving college with a keen interest in sport , his friends suggested he apply to the school leaver program at locog -lrb- london 2012 organising committee of the olympic games and paralympic games -rrb- .
after several interviews and training days , kieran and nine other leavers were given full-time jobs working in locog 's canary wharf office to help organise the 2012 games .
video : kieran 's story loser michael jones is a greenwich entrepreneur and family man who owns a butcher 's and cheese shop a stone 's throw from the historic park .
he fears that the olympic plans for his area will have an adverse effect on his business .
he reckons that the traffic increases will cause major disruption , and is unhappy about proposals to transform the park into the olympic equestrian centre .
london 2012 say the entire park will only be closed for four weeks and there are no planned residential road closures .
a spokeswoman added : " there will be huge benefits to local shops and businesses with the additional visitors coming to greenwich . "
video : michael 's story winner dalawar chaudhary is a southall entrepreneur and restaurateur who already caters for the pakistan cricket team , and now aims to extend his hospitality to the pakistan olympic team .
dalawar believes that southall is the best home for the pakistan olympian families during 2012 , and has played a key part in the bid for the team to train , live and dine in southall .
video : dalawar 's story winner dartford resident paul horden sees the arrival of the olympics in london as a fantastic business opportunity .
by buying several web domain names , he intends to run a site where he can rent the ex-council homes belonging to himself and his friends and family to olympic visitors .
paul believes that dartford 's fast-track bus system and bluewater shopping centre make it an ideal place to be based for the olympics .

bbc - london - london 2012 : winners or losers ? / 2012 bbc local -pipe- london -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 05:51 gmt , friday , 30 october 2009 london 2012 : winners or losers ?
bbc london marks 1,000 days to go until the 2012 games with a series of personal films by some those who believe they will gain or lose out .
winner kieran shekoni is a talented 19-year old from clapham who enjoys producing music .
as a former fulham junior player , he also likes a kick about with his friends .
after leaving college with a keen interest in sport , his friends suggested he apply to the school leaver program at locog -lrb- london 2012 organising committee of the olympic games and paralympic games -rrb- .
after several interviews and training days , kieran and nine other leavers were given full-time jobs working in locog 's canary wharf office to help organise the 2012 games .
video : kieran 's story loser michael jones is a greenwich entrepreneur and family man who owns a butcher 's and cheese shop a stone 's throw from the historic park .
he fears that the olympic plans for his area will have an adverse effect on his business .
he reckons that the traffic increases will cause major disruption , and is unhappy about proposals to transform the park into the olympic equestrian centre .
london 2012 say the entire park will only be closed for four weeks and there are no planned residential road closures .
a spokeswoman added : " there will be huge benefits to local shops and businesses with the additional visitors coming to greenwich . "
video : michael 's story winner dalawar chaudhary is a southall entrepreneur and restaurateur who already caters for the pakistan cricket team , and now aims to extend his hospitality to the pakistan olympic team .
dalawar believes that southall is the best home for the pakistan olympian families during 2012 , and has played a key part in the bid for the team to train , live and dine in southall .
video : dalawar 's story winner dartford resident paul horden sees the arrival of the olympics in london as a fantastic business opportunity .
by buying several web domain names , he intends to run a site where he can rent the ex-council homes belonging to himself and his friends and family to olympic visitors .
paul believes that dartford 's fast-track bus system and bluewater shopping centre make it an ideal place to be based for the olympics .

bbc - wiltshire - a modern bargain : pig 's trotters / people & places bbc local -pipe- wiltshire -pipe- things to do -pipe- people & places -pipe- tv & radio -pipe- 06:14 gmt , friday , 30 october 2009 a modern bargain : pig 's trotters by ashley heath bbc wiltshire cheaper cuts of meat are making a comeback at wiltshire 's meal times .
pig 's cheeks , chitterlings and oxtail are being looked on as a bargain worth buying by cooks working to a budget .
once seen as ' not good enough ' , these cheap cuts are seeing increasing demand at the county 's butchers .
i looked more closely at the phenomenon and challenged a salisbury bistro to come up with a recipe that even the most nervous home cook might attempt in their own kitchen .
pritchett butchers are in fish row in salisbury .
the window is full of the usual fare you might expect , as well as some you might not .
100 a week mark aldridge is the owner .
" when we put pigs trotters in the window , tourists sometimes stop and take photographs .
they think it 's really novel ! "
what 's also novel is how the humble pigs trotter , and other cheaper cuts of meat , are making a comeback .
mark said " they 're getting more and more popular , increasing every day .
we 're selling 50 to 100 trotters a week now , on average , 25p each , so they 're not expensive to buy .
" and you get a lovely flavour out of ' em . "
that may be so but riding high in my mind was the question of how you can be sure that the pigs foot , in contact with all that comes with a farm yard , is actually clean enough to buy once it 's in the butchers shop .
" they 're clean " , said mark .
" when they 're at the abattoir , the trotters go into a hot tank , and beaters to remove the hairs and then they get washed again , so they come up really clean . "
bistro challenge buying trotters is n't a problem then but what can you do with them ?
to help us answer that question , bbc wiltshire enlisted the help of the lxix bistro in salisbury 's castle street .
andy griggs is the owner , and josh colman is his head chef .
together , they came up with a recipe that we can all try , to see if we like pigs trotters .
andy thinks that this rediscovery of pigs trotters is purely generational .
" the modern generation , only familiar with supermarket cuts , are n't being exposed to more traditional cuts , which very often go to waste " , said andy .
josh is the head chef and believes that pigs trotters are an essential part of cooking .
" if i did n't have pigs trotters , i could n't make the stocks that i do , " said josh .
" i always have to have them ; that 's what i mainly use trotters for .
they 're just brilliant , they give a jellified thickness to your gravy . "
" but have you tried trotters as a dish yet ? "
i asked .
" no " was josh 's answer , which made the tastiness of his own recipe all the more interesting !
once he 'd eaten his own recipe , josh seemed impressed .
" very nice , very tender " , he said .
as for the future of pig 's trotters , it seems their popularity is assured .
it 's now a case of whether that will drive up prices .
andy thinks it will .
" we tend to see a hike in price , as we did in the last recession with pig 's cheeks for example , especially when celebrity chefs get hold of something , " he said .
so , not so much a case of ' get them while they 're hot , but cheap ! "

to help us answer that question , bbc wiltshire enlisted the help of the lxix bistro in salisbury 's castle street .
lxix : andy griggs and josh colman andy griggs is the owner , and josh colman is his head chef .
together , they came up with a recipe that we can all try , to see if we like pigs trotters .
andy thinks that this rediscovery of pigs trotters is purely generational .
" the modern generation , only familiar with supermarket cuts , are n't being exposed to more traditional cuts , which very often go to waste " , said andy .
josh is the head chef and believes that pigs trotters are an essential part of cooking .
" if i did n't have pigs trotters , i could n't make the stocks that i do , " said josh .
" i always have to have them ; that 's what i mainly use trotters for .
they 're just brilliant , they give a jellified thickness to your gravy . "
first time trotter : josh tries his own recipe " but have you tried trotters as a dish yet ? "
i asked .
" no " was josh 's answer , which made the tastiness of his own recipe all the more interesting !
once he 'd eaten his own recipe , josh seemed impressed .
" very nice , very tender " , he said .
as for the future of pig 's trotters , it seems their popularity is assured .
it 's now a case of whether that will drive up prices .
andy thinks it will .
" we tend to see a hike in price , as we did in the last recession with pig 's cheeks for example , especially when celebrity chefs get hold of something , " he said .
so , not so much a case of ' get them while they 're hot , but cheap ! "

the company suffered an operating loss of 32.6bn yen -lrb- $ 357.5m ; £ 216.9m -rrb- in the three months to september , from a profit of 11.05bn yen a year earlier .
however it has now cut its operating loss forecast to 60bn yen from 110bn yen for the year ending march 2010 .
meanwhile panasonic and toshiba both reported quarterly profits .
operating profit at panasonic , the world 's largest plasma tv maker , was 49.1bn yen in the three months to september , against 118.6bn yen a year earlier .
the company posted a 72.9bn yen profit last year .
and toshiba said its microchip operations had earned it an operating profit of 5.2bn yen in the three months to september , up from a 29.3bn yen loss the previous year , helped by cost cutting and steadier prices .
sony , the world 's second largest lcd tv maker , recently cut the sales price of its playstation 3 games console .
" the outlook looks a bit brighter , but we need to watch whether its semiconductor business will pick up , " said kazutaka oshima , of ratuken investment management in tokyo .
" i also feel positive about its outlook as sony managed to narrow down its losses despite the yen 's strength . "
however , sony 's mobile phone joint venture with sweden 's ericsson has seen a recent decline in sales , which some analysts put down to its lack of a strong smartphone handset to rival apple 's iphone and research in motion 's blackberry .

and toshiba said its microchip operations had earned it an operating profit of 5.2bn yen in the three months to september , up from a 29.3bn yen loss the previous year , helped by cost cutting and steadier prices .
sony , the world 's second largest lcd tv maker , recently cut the sales price of its playstation 3 games console .
" the outlook looks a bit brighter , but we need to watch whether its semiconductor business will pick up , " said kazutaka oshima , of ratuken investment management in tokyo .
" i also feel positive about its outlook as sony managed to narrow down its losses despite the yen 's strength . "
however , sony 's mobile phone joint venture with sweden 's ericsson has seen a recent decline in sales , which some analysts put down to its lack of a strong smartphone handset to rival apple 's iphone and research in motion 's blackberry .

duncan 's show will be coming live from the phoenix cinema in falmouth .
a special screening of two films have been secured with all the proceeds going to cin .
mamma mia is one of the featured movies on the night and duncan hopes everyone attending will wear their brightest ' 70s gear .
it takes place on friday 20 november .
there will be two films on the silver screen on bbc children in need night in falmouth .
' radio wonderful ' this was made back in 1974 in association with the bbc and looks back at the re-organisation of the bbc 's domestic radio services with the introduction of radio 1,2,3 & 4 , and the first of the bbc local radio stations .
there are only two copies of this film left in the world , and we are very privileged that the owners have agreed to release one for this special evening .
the film features many household names , tony blackburn , jimmy saville , johnnie walker , and some great broadcasters who are no longer with us like john peel and alan ' fluff ' freeman .
the film runs for just 30 minutes , and without doubt it will be the only time you will ever be able to watch it in a cinema .
the main attraction of the evening is ' mama mia ! '
this film was an enormous success when first released last year .
it has now been withdrawn from the cinema so this again will be a one-off showing and most likely to be the last time you will catch it on the big screen .
it 's a great chance to join in with a sing-song and duncan warren wants to encourage people to come along dressed as ' abba ' .
ticket prices : adults £ 6.00 children / seniors £ 4.50 these can be purchased by phone on 01326 313072 from 11.00am - 10.00pm thursday to sunday , and from monday to wednesday 4.00pm - 10.00pm.
a 50p booking fee is applied to all telephone bookings .
tickets can also be purchased direct from the phoenix cinema , and advanced bookings or ticket purchase is advised as there is a limit to how many the cinema can hold .
' radio wonderful ' will be the first of the two films to be shown starting at 7.30pm.
duncan warren 's radio programme will be live at the cinema from 7.00pm - 10.00pm with guests dropping in throughout the evening .
duncan and his assistant joy robinson also encourage anyone who has raised money throughout the day or during the evening to come along and hand it in live on-air .
the annual trelawney challenge will also feature within the programme .

duncan 's show will be coming live from the phoenix cinema in falmouth .
a special screening of two films have been secured with all the proceeds going to cin .
mamma mia is one of the featured movies on the night and duncan hopes everyone attending will wear their brightest ' 70s gear .
it takes place on friday 20 november .
there will be two films on the silver screen on bbc children in need night in falmouth .
duncan warren will host his evening programme from falmouth ' radio wonderful ' this was made back in 1974 in association with the bbc and looks back at the re-organisation of the bbc 's domestic radio services with the introduction of radio 1,2,3 & 4 , and the first of the bbc local radio stations .
there are only two copies of this film left in the world , and we are very privileged that the owners have agreed to release one for this special evening .
the film features many household names , tony blackburn , jimmy saville , johnnie walker , and some great broadcasters who are no longer with us like john peel and alan ' fluff ' freeman .
the film runs for just 30 minutes , and without doubt it will be the only time you will ever be able to watch it in a cinema .
the main attraction of the evening is ' mama mia ! '
this film was an enormous success when first released last year .
it has now been withdrawn from the cinema so this again will be a one-off showing and most likely to be the last time you will catch it on the big screen .
it 's a great chance to join in with a sing-song and duncan warren wants to encourage people to come along dressed as ' abba ' .
pudsey is a busy bear raising money for bbc children in need ticket prices : adults £ 6.00 children / seniors £ 4.50 these can be purchased by phone on 01326 313072 from 11.00am - 10.00pm thursday to sunday , and from monday to wednesday 4.00pm - 10.00pm.

now , it 's almost all free , instant and infinite .
and our relationship with music has changed forever .
we all know what the alleged future of music will look like .
the record industry will be reduced to a smouldering ruin , the album replaced by endless individual songs and music rendered pretty much worthless by the fact that it 's universally free .
empty record shops will be overrun with weeds and old cds will be used as coasters .
your madonnas , u2s and coldplays will prosper , but for anyone further down the hierarchy , the idea of making much of a living will be a non-starter .
that 's the accepted wisdom , at least .
some of it will probably prove to be true .
but that grisly picture ignores subtler and more fascinating changes in our relationship with music that people have barely begun to understand .
now , just to make this clear from the off : i 'm nearly 40 .
having recently moved house and consigned my cd collection to cardboard boxes , i 've been surprised to find that i do n't miss it at all .
i use the free version of the music streaming application spotify almost every day - and i now understand that it represents a genuine revolution in music consumption -lrb- and makes itunes look pathetically old-fashioned -rrb- .
should the music industry finally get its act together and insist on some kind of subscription model , i 'll pay for the same kind of service .
but i would n't imagine that will alter my new listening habits .
all that said , my musical mindset is still rooted in an increasingly far-off past , where to be a true fan of a band took real dedication , access to obscure information - and , frankly , money .
i 've just poured the music-related contents of my brain into a book , and i would imagine that 30-ish year 's worth of knowledge about everyone from funkadelic to the smiths has probably cost me a five-figure sum , a stupid amount spent on music publications , and endless embarrassed moments spent trying to have a conversation with those arrogant blokes who tend to work in record shops .
last weekend , by contrast , i had a long chat about music with the 16-year-old son of a friend , and my mind boggled .
at virtually no cost , in precious little time and with zero embarrassment , he had become an expert on all kinds of artists , from english singer-songwriters like nick drake and john martyn to such american indie-rock titans as pavement and dinosaur jr .
though only a sixth-former , he seemingly knew as much about most of these people as any music writer .
like any rock-oriented youth , his appetite for music is endless , and so is the opportunity - whether illegally or not - to indulge it .
he is a paid-up fan of bands it took me until i was 30 to even discover - and at this rate , by the time he hits his 20s , he 'll have reached the true musical outer limits .
what does all this tell us ?
clearly , for anyone raised in the old world , the modern way of music consumption has all kinds of unforeseen benefits .
a good example : though i 've always heard plenty of talk about the utter awfulness of such infamous albums as lou reed 's metal machine music -lrb- a double album of guitar feedback and white noise -rrb- or deep purple 's concerto for group and orchestra -lrb- do n't ask -rrb- , i can now listen to them for nothing , and have an opinion of my own . "
as one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present " they 're both terrible , incidentally , but that is n't the point .
what really matters is the fact that i can so easily tune in - and what that says about a new world of completely risk-free listening .
most importantly , as the great digital revolution rolls on , bands are no longer having to compete for people 's money .
instead , they 're jockeying for our time .
and the field is huge , crossing not just genres , but eras .
who do you want to investigate today : tv on the radio or crosby , stills and nash ?
do you fancy losing yourself in the brilliant first album by florence and the machine , or deriving no end of entertainment from how awful the rolling stones got in the 1980s ?
little richard or la roux ?
white lies or black sabbath ?
as one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present .
for musicians , it 's self-evident that there are all kinds of new openings for their music , but even if they break through , much less concerted attention will be paid to it .
they may get an audience , but it will be very easily distracted .
after all , endlessly playing the same album so as to extract your " money 's worth " is behaviour that will soon seem like something from the dark ages .
woe betide the act that decides to make the kind of record that tends to be charitably described as a " grower " - something that may account for , say , the scant interest paid to the last u2 album .
certainly , as a record company md told me a couple of weeks ago , stuffing your albums with mere filler is no longer a sensible option .
so , yes , the record industry may yet have to comprehensively reinvent itself , or implode .
sooner or later , given that the need to read reviews before deciding what to listen to is fading fast , i rather fear that even music journalists may be rendered irrelevant .
but for now , this is a truly golden age - the era of the teenage expert , albums that will soon have to be full of finely-honed hits and the completely infinite online jukebox .
even if the music business manages to somehow crack down on illicit downloading and claws back a few quid via annual subscriptions in return for that self-same endless supply of music , the same essential rules will apply .
really : what 's not to like ?

now , it 's almost all free , instant and infinite .
and our relationship with music has changed forever .
we all know what the alleged future of music will look like .
the record industry will be reduced to a smouldering ruin , the album replaced by endless individual songs and music rendered pretty much worthless by the fact that it 's universally free .
empty record shops will be overrun with weeds and old cds will be used as coasters .
your madonnas , u2s and coldplays will prosper , but for anyone further down the hierarchy , the idea of making much of a living will be a non-starter .
that 's the accepted wisdom , at least .
some of it will probably prove to be true .
but that grisly picture ignores subtler and more fascinating changes in our relationship with music that people have barely begun to understand .
fans can instantly discover the rolling stones ' 1980s works , if they want to now , just to make this clear from the off : i 'm nearly 40 .
having recently moved house and consigned my cd collection to cardboard boxes , i 've been surprised to find that i do n't miss it at all .
i use the free version of the music streaming application spotify almost every day - and i now understand that it represents a genuine revolution in music consumption -lrb- and makes itunes look pathetically old-fashioned -rrb- .
should the music industry finally get its act together and insist on some kind of subscription model , i 'll pay for the same kind of service .
but i would n't imagine that will alter my new listening habits .
all that said , my musical mindset is still rooted in an increasingly far-off past , where to be a true fan of a band took real dedication , access to obscure information - and , frankly , money .
i 've just poured the music-related contents of my brain into a book , and i would imagine that 30-ish year 's worth of knowledge about everyone from funkadelic to the smiths has probably cost me a five-figure sum , a stupid amount spent on music publications , and endless embarrassed moments spent trying to have a conversation with those arrogant blokes who tend to work in record shops .
last weekend , by contrast , i had a long chat about music with the 16-year-old son of a friend , and my mind boggled .
what to listen to next : little richard or la roux ?
at virtually no cost , in precious little time and with zero embarrassment , he had become an expert on all kinds of artists , from english singer-songwriters like nick drake and john martyn to such american indie-rock titans as pavement and dinosaur jr .
though only a sixth-former , he seemingly knew as much about most of these people as any music writer .
like any rock-oriented youth , his appetite for music is endless , and so is the opportunity - whether illegally or not - to indulge it .
he is a paid-up fan of bands it took me until i was 30 to even discover - and at this rate , by the time he hits his 20s , he 'll have reached the true musical outer limits .
what does all this tell us ?
clearly , for anyone raised in the old world , the modern way of music consumption has all kinds of unforeseen benefits .
a good example : though i 've always heard plenty of talk about the utter awfulness of such infamous albums as lou reed 's metal machine music -lrb- a double album of guitar feedback and white noise -rrb- or deep purple 's concerto for group and orchestra -lrb- do n't ask -rrb- , i can now listen to them for nothing , and have an opinion of my own .
as one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present they 're both terrible , incidentally , but that is n't the point .
what really matters is the fact that i can so easily tune in - and what that says about a new world of completely risk-free listening .
most importantly , as the great digital revolution rolls on , bands are no longer having to compete for people 's money .
instead , they 're jockeying for our time .
and the field is huge , crossing not just genres , but eras .
who do you want to investigate today : tv on the radio or crosby , stills and nash ?
do you fancy losing yourself in the brilliant first album by florence and the machine , or deriving no end of entertainment from how awful the rolling stones got in the 1980s ?
little richard or la roux ?
white lies or black sabbath ?
as one of my music press colleagues use to say , there 's no longer any past - just an endless present .
u2 's last album may have been a " grower " - but not many let it grow for musicians , it 's self-evident that there are all kinds of new openings for their music , but even if they break through , much less concerted attention will be paid to it .
they may get an audience , but it will be very easily distracted .
after all , endlessly playing the same album so as to extract your " money 's worth " is behaviour that will soon seem like something from the dark ages .
woe betide the act that decides to make the kind of record that tends to be charitably described as a " grower " - something that may account for , say , the scant interest paid to the last u2 album .
certainly , as a record company md told me a couple of weeks ago , stuffing your albums with mere filler is no longer a sensible option .
so , yes , the record industry may yet have to comprehensively reinvent itself , or implode .
sooner or later , given that the need to read reviews before deciding what to listen to is fading fast , i rather fear that even music journalists may be rendered irrelevant .
but for now , this is a truly golden age - the era of the teenage expert , albums that will soon have to be full of finely-honed hits and the completely infinite online jukebox .
even if the music business manages to somehow crack down on illicit downloading and claws back a few quid via annual subscriptions in return for that self-same endless supply of music , the same essential rules will apply .

the movie , which is based on rehearsal footage for the star 's ill-fated comeback shows , was premiered around the world on tuesday .
steve elzer from sony pictures said the movie is a " reaffirmation of the global appeal of michael jackson " .
the film made $ 7.4m -lrb- £ 4,4m -rrb- in the us and $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- in the uk .
oscar nomination " the studio believes that the worldwide launch , with very strong performance across north america , europe , latin america and asia , represents an amazing beginning for the film , " mr elzer said in a statement .
he has also revealed that the studio will submit the movie to the academy awards for consideration this year in the best picture category .
to be a contender for oscar shortlisting , the film must complete a seven-day run in los angeles county and film-makers would need to " submit the proper paperwork , " academy spokeswoman leslie unger said .
director kenny ortega said the late star " deserves " to win an oscar .
jackson 's brothers attended the film 's screening in la on tuesday and simultaneous premieres were held in 18 other cities around the world .
the movie was then released to cinemas on wednesday for a two-week run only .
however , sony has said the movie will be extended beyond its planned stint if ticket demand is high .
the movie , which runs to nearly two hours , features jackson singing and dancing to his biggest hits , including beat it , black or white and man in the mirror .
jackson , who died on 25 june aged 50 , had spent the previous four months rehearsing in la for the record 50 concerts which were to be held in london .
more than 800,000 tickets had been sold for the concerts , with organisers promising one of the " most expensive and technically advanced " live shows ever .
he was just two weeks away from the opening night at the time of his death .
by the weekend , it will be shown in 110 countries .

the movie , which is based on rehearsal footage for the star 's ill-fated comeback shows , was premiered around the world on tuesday .
steve elzer from sony pictures said the movie is a " reaffirmation of the global appeal of michael jackson " .
the film made $ 7.4m -lrb- £ 4,4m -rrb- in the us and $ 2m -lrb- £ 1.2m -rrb- in the uk .
oscar nomination " the studio believes that the worldwide launch , with very strong performance across north america , europe , latin america and asia , represents an amazing beginning for the film , " mr elzer said in a statement .
he has also revealed that the studio will submit the movie to the academy awards for consideration this year in the best picture category .
to be a contender for oscar shortlisting , the film must complete a seven-day run in los angeles county and film-makers would need to " submit the proper paperwork , " academy spokeswoman leslie unger said .
fans went wild at the london screening director kenny ortega said the late star " deserves " to win an oscar .
jackson 's brothers attended the film 's screening in la on tuesday and simultaneous premieres were held in 18 other cities around the world .
the movie was then released to cinemas on wednesday for a two-week run only .
however , sony has said the movie will be extended beyond its planned stint if ticket demand is high .
the movie , which runs to nearly two hours , features jackson singing and dancing to his biggest hits , including beat it , black or white and man in the mirror .
jackson , who died on 25 june aged 50 , had spent the previous four months rehearsing in la for the record 50 concerts which were to be held in london .
more than 800,000 tickets had been sold for the concerts , with organisers promising one of the " most expensive and technically advanced " live shows ever .
he was just two weeks away from the opening night at the time of his death .
by the weekend , it will be shown in 110 countries .

she is decorating her broomstick in preparation for samhain , the celtic new year .
the broomstick , known as a bessom , is decorated with autumnal colours to reflect the time of year .
the broomsticks symbolise thresholds and at this time of year represent the threshold between our world and the next world .
witches say the veils between the worlds are thin so the bessom can be used in ceremonies to contact deceased loved ones .
the green man is the rawness of nature and is regarded as the guardian of all green places , like garden and the forests .
he plays a more prominent role in the springtime festivals .
the scrying bowl made of black glass in the background is filled with water and is used like a crystal ball to predict the future during samhain ceremonies .
at this time of year herne is said to walk the earth .
he has hooves of the goat , which is nature evolving into man , and his stags , which open up to the universe , represent the spirituality of mankind .
rune stones are actually made of wood and each one has a symbol carved into them .
the idea is to cast the runes or ask people to pick some out , so witches can predict the future or advise them on a particular issue .

ghana is one african country targeting the boom in so-called " health tourism " .
the holy trinity spa offers services unavailable elsewhere in africa " no pain no gain " is the stern message painted on the side of the ornamental pirogue at the holy trinity health spa on the banks of ghana 's river volta .
but for the clients here , a short cut to the body beautiful is the main reason for their visit .
as well as an array of massage , hydrotherapy and beauty treatments , holy trinity also offers a range of cosmetic and other surgery .
it says it is attracting hundreds of foreign visitors a year , with the offer of cut price treatment administered by doctors mostly trained in western medical schools .
unlike health tourists in the west , customers here are accessing services often not available in their own countries .
cutting-edge treatment michael nkwoji , a nigerian businessman is one of those taking a break at the holy trinity .
so far , he has received a full kidney and liver check , stress therapy and a total body detox .
" i honestly could n't find a clinic like this in lagos , " he says .

george amoh says there should be more basic health care instead of spas the idea of recuperating at leisure in a peaceful location , with cutting-edge treatment delivered at a bargain price , is proving irresistible .
the clinic is attracting customers from all over west africa and beyond .
however , for some , these clinics are an unwelcome arrival in ghana , where most citizens struggle to get the most basic health care , diverting resources and staff that would be more usefully employed elsewhere .
" the ordinary people who should have access to hard-pressed facilities are not getting access because of tourists and have to compete with them , " says health campaigner george amoh .
but the managing director of holy trinity , dr felix anyaa , says that if it is handled properly , all of ghana can benefit from this new industry .
" with the influx of the foreign exchange that comes into the country , we will be able to build a health service and institutions and enhance conditions in the -lsb- overall -rsb- health service structure , " he says , " and we shall be able to stop the brain drain . "

ghana is one african country targeting the boom in so-called " health tourism " .
the holy trinity spa offers services unavailable elsewhere in africa " no pain no gain " is the stern message painted on the side of the ornamental pirogue at the holy trinity health spa on the banks of ghana 's river volta .
but for the clients here , a short cut to the body beautiful is the main reason for their visit .
as well as an array of massage , hydrotherapy and beauty treatments , holy trinity also offers a range of cosmetic and other surgery .
it says it is attracting hundreds of foreign visitors a year , with the offer of cut price treatment administered by doctors mostly trained in western medical schools .
unlike health tourists in the west , customers here are accessing services often not available in their own countries .
cutting-edge treatment michael nkwoji , a nigerian businessman is one of those taking a break at the holy trinity .
so far , he has received a full kidney and liver check , stress therapy and a total body detox .
" i honestly could n't find a clinic like this in lagos , " he says .
" i did n't know of one in africa , so when i found this place , i was surprised . "
george amoh says there should be more basic health care instead of spas the idea of recuperating at leisure in a peaceful location , with cutting-edge treatment delivered at a bargain price , is proving irresistible .
the clinic is attracting customers from all over west africa and beyond .
however , for some , these clinics are an unwelcome arrival in ghana , where most citizens struggle to get the most basic health care , diverting resources and staff that would be more usefully employed elsewhere .
" the ordinary people who should have access to hard-pressed facilities are not getting access because of tourists and have to compete with them , " says health campaigner george amoh .
but the managing director of holy trinity , dr felix anyaa , says that if it is handled properly , all of ghana can benefit from this new industry .
" with the influx of the foreign exchange that comes into the country , we will be able to build a health service and institutions and enhance conditions in the -lsb- overall -rsb- health service structure , " he says , " and we shall be able to stop the brain drain . "
