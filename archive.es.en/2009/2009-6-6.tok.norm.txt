program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament looking back : 30 years of european union elections europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 06.06.2009 german elections leave millions without the right to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 375 million people in 27 european union member states are eligible to vote 62 million germans are entitled to vote in the eu parliamentary elections and in germany 's parallel local elections on sunday .
but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .

yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

the security experts also warned of attacks within germany .
unlike other european countries such as britain or spain , germany has not experienced a terrorist attack in years .
the attacks were due to be carried out by a group known as " al qaeda in the islamic maghreb " with extensive ties and connections in western europe .
in recent months , officials in berlin have repeatedly warned that the country is a likely target for islamist militants with the aim to end the german presence in afghanistan , which is already unpopular with the german public .

the five photos by antonello zappadu include shots of two scantily-clad women beside a hot tub , a naked man and berlusconi walking around with a woman at his villa certosa on the mediterranean island of sardinia .
the spanish newspaper did not say how it got hold of the photos , all of them taken by zappadu between 2007 and 2009 .
the pictures were seized by prosecutors after berlusconi 's lawyers accused the photographer of violating the premier 's privacy .
private vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech prime minister mirek topolanek has admitted that he is the man in the photos though all the faces in the photos are blurred apart from berlusconi 's , former czech prime minister mirek topolanek appeared to acknowledge that he was in one of the photos , .
topolanek , who had earlier denied the existence of such photographs , appeared to backtrack on friday , telling reporters before casting his vote in the european elections that the picture had been doctored .
" it is obviously a photomontage , " pravo daily cited him as saying on its web site .
" on the other hand , i view it as a brutal invasion of privacy .
it was a private vacation . "
the former czech premier accused socialists of deliberately running the picture on election day in the czech republic .
" i did not know that the european election was that important for the socialists to use such ridiculous attacks and manipulations , " reports cited him as saying .
no harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photos have sparked a debate about the nature of the relationship between berlusconi and letizia the italian daily la repubblica also reproduced the photos , which el pais said were exclusive , citing the copyright as belonging to ecoprensa colombia .
berlusconi 's lawyer niccolo ghedini said the photos had been published " illegally " without berlusconi 's permission .
the premier himself described the photos as harmless and their publication as a " scandalous aggression , " explaining he did not fear the loss of catholic votes in this weekend 's european elections .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega declined to comment on the affair , saying the government " never judged " leaders of other countries. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said .

wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .

since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

" i ca n't understand at all why some in the social democratic party want to burden german taxpayers with a risk instead of tackling the causes , " the chancellor told bild am sonntag , referring to her coalition partners in the government who are in favor of getting the state involved . merkel said the owners and creditors needed to explain why it is that some parts of the company , such as travel operator thomas cook , are still financially sound .

the five photos by antonello zappadu include shots of two scantily-clad women beside a hot tub , a naked man and berlusconi walking around with a woman at his villa certosa on the mediterranean island of sardinia .
the spanish newspaper did not say how it got hold of the photos , all of them taken by zappadu between 2007 and 2009 .
the pictures were seized by prosecutors after berlusconi 's lawyers accused the photographer of violating the premier 's privacy .
private vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech prime minister mirek topolanek has admitted that he is the man in the photos though all the faces in the photos are blurred apart from berlusconi 's , former czech prime minister mirek topolanek appeared to acknowledge that he was in one of the photos , .
topolanek , who had earlier denied the existence of such photographs , appeared to backtrack on friday , telling reporters before casting his vote in the european elections that the picture had been doctored .
" it is obviously a photomontage , " pravo daily cited him as saying on its web site .
" on the other hand , i view it as a brutal invasion of privacy .
it was a private vacation . "
the former czech premier accused socialists of deliberately running the picture on election day in the czech republic .
" i did not know that the european election was that important for the socialists to use such ridiculous attacks and manipulations , " reports cited him as saying .
no harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photos have sparked a debate about the nature of the relationship between berlusconi and letizia the italian daily la repubblica also reproduced the photos , which el pais said were exclusive , citing the copyright as belonging to ecoprensa colombia .
berlusconi 's lawyer niccolo ghedini said the photos had been published " illegally " without berlusconi 's permission .
the premier himself described the photos as harmless and their publication as a " scandalous aggression , " explaining he did not fear the loss of catholic votes in this weekend 's european elections .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega declined to comment on the affair , saying the government " never judged " leaders of other countries. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament looking back : 30 years of european union elections europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 06.06.2009 german elections leave millions without the right to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 375 million people in 27 european union member states are eligible to vote 62 million germans are entitled to vote in the eu parliamentary elections and in germany 's parallel local elections on sunday .
but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

the security experts also warned of attacks within germany .
unlike other european countries such as britain or spain , germany has not experienced a terrorist attack in years .
the attacks were due to be carried out by a group known as " al qaeda in the islamic maghreb " with extensive ties and connections in western europe .
in recent months , officials in berlin have repeatedly warned that the country is a likely target for islamist militants with the aim to end the german presence in afghanistan , which is already unpopular with the german public .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

topolanek , who had earlier denied the existence of such photographs , appeared to backtrack on friday , telling reporters before casting his vote in the european elections that the picture had been doctored .
" it is obviously a photomontage , " pravo daily cited him as saying on its web site .
" on the other hand , i view it as a brutal invasion of privacy .
it was a private vacation . "
the former czech premier accused socialists of deliberately running the picture on election day in the czech republic .
" i did not know that the european election was that important for the socialists to use such ridiculous attacks and manipulations , " reports cited him as saying .

berlusconi 's lawyer niccolo ghedini said the photos had been published " illegally " without berlusconi 's permission .
the premier himself described the photos as harmless and their publication as a " scandalous aggression , " explaining he did not fear the loss of catholic votes in this weekend 's european elections .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega declined to comment on the affair , saying the government " never judged " leaders of other countries. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : european union elections overview : political groups in the european parliament looking back : 30 years of european union elections europeans to elect parliament in lengthy , complex process examining the power and powerlessness of eu parliamentarians elections -pipe- 06.06.2009 german elections leave millions without the right to vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 375 million people in 27 european union member states are eligible to vote 62 million germans are entitled to vote in the eu parliamentary elections and in germany 's parallel local elections on sunday .
but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

the five photos by antonello zappadu include shots of two scantily-clad women beside a hot tub , a naked man and berlusconi walking around with a woman at his villa certosa on the mediterranean island of sardinia .
the spanish newspaper did not say how it got hold of the photos , all of them taken by zappadu between 2007 and 2009 .
the pictures were seized by prosecutors after berlusconi 's lawyers accused the photographer of violating the premier 's privacy .

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de world war ii -pipe- 06.06.2009 military cemetery has become a special symbol of reconciliation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 21,000 soldiers are buried at la cambe there are countless places in normandy , france , that remind the visitor of d-day .
yet the military cemetery at la cambe has become a special symbol of franco-german reconciliation . in the early hours of june 6 , 1944 , around 160,000 allied troops landed on the french coast of normandy .
this was so-called d-day , which established a western front on the continent and turned out to be crucial in bringing down nazi tyranny in europe .
a year later world war ii was over . the entrance to the cemetery at la cambe is a narrow stone arch opening on to a lawn with almost endless rows of graves .
there are more than 21,000 soldiers buried at la cambe , making it the biggest of the six military cemeteries in normandy .
but there are only a few crosses on the green , most of the graves are simple plaques in the ground with names and dates on them .
around 80 percent of those buried here were less than 20 years old when they died , says groundskeeper lucien tisserand .
all of normandy strewn with corpses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : auguste vallet helped to build the cemetary in the 1950s a few kilometers from the cemetery is the village of la cambe .
auguste vallet , an 84-year-old gardener , helped build the cemetery and bury the dead in the 1950s .
he recalls how the makeshift burial ground was used by both german and us troops .
" the americans had buried their victims on the one side and the germans were put on the other side of the cemetery , " vallet told deutsche welle . " that went on for six or seven years until the americans built a cemetery close to omaha beach .
then the germans were exhumed , the site was re-planned and they were buried again . "
" in the war , all of normandy was strewn with corpses that had to be identified . "
another resident of la cambe is charlotte dubost .
as a young girl she had to work for the germans .
she was 21 at the time of france 's liberation .
when us troops arrived at the village , she and other families were still hiding from the fighting in a hole in the ground .
now she regularly visits the cemetery .
" after the war there was a german couple who came here .
they had lost both of their sons here in normandy .
each year they visited the graves of their children , " dubost told deutsche welle .
" one day they asked us whether my husband and i could maybe look after the two graves .
and for many years now , that 's what we 've been doing .
it was not easy at the beginning , but after all , we have children of our own and we know that those young germans had never asked to come here and die . "
auguste vallet and charlotte dubost vividly remember the celebrations marking 60 years of d-day in 2004 .
then german chancellor gerhard schroeder did not visit the cemetery in la cambe because many ss soldiers are among the dead .
the decision triggered debate not only in germany but also in the little french village itself .
many of the villagers come to the cemetery each year on the 6th of june to take part in an annual commemoration ceremony .
gradual reconciliation after the war now and then there are still german veterans who visit the site , many are now too old to make the long trip from germany to france .
johannes boerner has no such problem - he stayed in france after the war and now lives in normandy .
in 1944 he fought in the battle for the town of saint-lo .
many of his friends from back then were never found .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : groundskeeper lucien tisserand says most of the dead were still teenagers " the fighting was very very heavy .
we were in saint-lo with 120 men and a month later only 9 were left .
then more troops were sent from germany - but those were kids , they were 16 years old , " boerner said . " they were incredibly scared , some of them cried when they had to go into battle .
some wanted to desert and run away .
but there was the order : if anyone crosses the lines , shoot them ! "
johannes boerner spent almost four years as a prisoner of war in france .
after that , he did not want to return to his hometown of leipzig in germany .
he decided to stay in normandy and married a french woman .
she still remembers how her grandfather was upset when she told him about her german fiancee .
" ' are there not enough french people , ' he asked me .
' do you really have to pick a german ? " '
today the couple can smile about that particular anecdote - a lot of things have changed since then .
but well into the 1960s it was difficult for boerner to live in france .
it took years for franco-german relations to get back to normal , and eventually - at the big ceremonies marking the 50th and 60th anniversary of d-day , german and french veterans commemorated side by side .
this year marks first time that the german embassy plans to hold an official ceremony at the cemetery at la cambe .
veterans from germany , france , britain , canada and the us will join in commemorating those who died in normandy 65 years ago .

the five photos by antonello zappadu include shots of two scantily-clad women beside a hot tub , a naked man and berlusconi walking around with a woman at his villa certosa on the mediterranean island of sardinia .
the spanish newspaper did not say how it got hold of the photos , all of them taken by zappadu between 2007 and 2009 .
the pictures were seized by prosecutors after berlusconi 's lawyers accused the photographer of violating the premier 's privacy .
private vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech prime minister mirek topolanek has admitted that he is the man in the photos though all the faces in the photos are blurred apart from berlusconi 's , former czech prime minister mirek topolanek appeared to acknowledge that he was in one of the photos , .
topolanek , who had earlier denied the existence of such photographs , appeared to backtrack on friday , telling reporters before casting his vote in the european elections that the picture had been doctored .
" it is obviously a photomontage , " pravo daily cited him as saying on its web site .
" on the other hand , i view it as a brutal invasion of privacy .
it was a private vacation . "
the former czech premier accused socialists of deliberately running the picture on election day in the czech republic .
" i did not know that the european election was that important for the socialists to use such ridiculous attacks and manipulations , " reports cited him as saying .
no harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photos have sparked a debate about the nature of the relationship between berlusconi and letizia the italian daily la repubblica also reproduced the photos , which el pais said were exclusive , citing the copyright as belonging to ecoprensa colombia .
berlusconi 's lawyer niccolo ghedini said the photos had been published " illegally " without berlusconi 's permission .
the premier himself described the photos as harmless and their publication as a " scandalous aggression , " explaining he did not fear the loss of catholic votes in this weekend 's european elections .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega declined to comment on the affair , saying the government " never judged " leaders of other countries. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the security experts also warned of attacks within germany .
unlike other european countries such as britain or spain , germany has not experienced a terrorist attack in years .
the attacks were due to be carried out by a group known as " al qaeda in the islamic maghreb " with extensive ties and connections in western europe .
in recent months , officials in berlin have repeatedly warned that the country is a likely target for islamist militants with the aim to end the german presence in afghanistan , which is already unpopular with the german public .

the five photos by antonello zappadu include shots of two scantily-clad women beside a hot tub , a naked man and berlusconi walking around with a woman at his villa certosa on the mediterranean island of sardinia .
the spanish newspaper did not say how it got hold of the photos , all of them taken by zappadu between 2007 and 2009 .
the pictures were seized by prosecutors after berlusconi 's lawyers accused the photographer of violating the premier 's privacy .
private vacation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former czech prime minister mirek topolanek has admitted that he is the man in the photos though all the faces in the photos are blurred apart from berlusconi 's , former czech prime minister mirek topolanek appeared to acknowledge that he was in one of the photos , .
topolanek , who had earlier denied the existence of such photographs , appeared to backtrack on friday , telling reporters before casting his vote in the european elections that the picture had been doctored .
" it is obviously a photomontage , " pravo daily cited him as saying on its web site .
" on the other hand , i view it as a brutal invasion of privacy .
it was a private vacation . "
the former czech premier accused socialists of deliberately running the picture on election day in the czech republic .
" i did not know that the european election was that important for the socialists to use such ridiculous attacks and manipulations , " reports cited him as saying .
no harm bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the photos have sparked a debate about the nature of the relationship between berlusconi and letizia the italian daily la repubblica also reproduced the photos , which el pais said were exclusive , citing the copyright as belonging to ecoprensa colombia .
berlusconi 's lawyer niccolo ghedini said the photos had been published " illegally " without berlusconi 's permission .
the premier himself described the photos as harmless and their publication as a " scandalous aggression , " explaining he did not fear the loss of catholic votes in this weekend 's european elections .
spanish deputy prime minister maria teresa fernandez de la vega declined to comment on the affair , saying the government " never judged " leaders of other countries. mrm / dpa / reuters / ap editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but several million long-term residents will not get a chance to cast their ballots . germany 's constitution and electoral law are quite specific : those entitled to vote in sunday 's double-pack of elections must have german citizenship - either through descent or a passport granted under strict integration rules .
they also need to be at least 18 years of age and be a resident in a german municipality for at least three months .
eu integration rules widen that circle to include an additional 2.1 million citizens of other eu countries who reside in germany .
they will be able to vote in the european parliament election and simultaneously in germany 's municipal elections being held in half of regional states .
the largest numbers of those eligible originate from italy , poland , greece , austria and the netherlands .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a woman casts her first ballot as a german citizen not included in sunday 's polls in germany are 3.6 million non-eu foreign residents of voting age .
these non-voters belong to a disparate group originating from the northern hemisphere 's non-eu countries , such as turkey and russia , as well as nations across africa , the americas , asia and ozeania .
strict rules remain controversial since women got the vote in weimar germany in 1919 , parliamentary debate has raged for decades over who else should participate in germany 's electoral processes by exercising the so-called active right as a voter and the " passive " right by becoming a candidate .
latest federal statistics bureau figures from wiesbaden show that even if german lawmakers stipulated a three-year waiting period of residency before voting , 3.3 million non-eu citizens would be eligible to cast ballots this election year .
but doing so would require germany to re-write its constitution .
bundestag debate shows deep divisions over voting rights last week in germany 's lower house of parliament , the greens and left party unsuccessfully sought to amend germany 's constitution so as to give resident non-eu foreign residents at least a communal vote ahead of this sunday 's city and county elections .
the two opposition parties lost by 88 votes to 437 .
chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives from the christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- led the charge in defeating the measure . cdu parliamentary spokesman ingo wellenreuther said foreigners should learn the german language and customs and then to apply for citizenship before voting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wellenreuther says foreigners need to become citizens if they want to vote " so often you draw the wrong conclusions , " he said . " the correct approach is that the right to vote must not be at the beginning but follow integration . "
wellenreuter added that extra voting rights for eu citizens living in germany was an exception stipulated only by eu rules on integration and reflected also in paragraph 28 of germany 's constitution .
the exclusion of the non-eu resident foreigners did not amount to inequality , he said .
an important part of democracy left party parliamentarian sevim dagdelen said she wants to see resident non-eu foreigners get a communal right to vote like their counterparts in 16 other nations of the european union .
many foreigners living in germany are long-time residents , with an average stay of 17 years , she said .
it is a " missing opportunity to participate in a core area of democracy , in elections , which amounts to a major democratic deficit , " dagdelen said .
center-left social democrats in chancellor merkel 's grand coalition expressed sympathy for extending eligibility , but voted to uphold the coalition and reject the amendment .
requirements vary between countries paul guerin , a senior researcher with the stockholm-based international institute for democracy and electoral assistance , says idea in its world-wide surveys of voting rights identify citizenship as the usual prerequisite in 96 percent of the countries questioned .
residency is a criteria in a third of the countries , and the period can be anything from one to five years .
naturalization is also a possibility .
" these are examples where you may have to prove that your parents were citizens of that country , " guerin told deutsche welle .
since the 1970s numerous european and commonwealth countries , including britain and australia , have extended voting to so-called " third country " foreign residents on their territories .
" the uk could be cited as an example , because of the commonwealth agreement .
so a number of other citizens from commonwealth countries who come to reside in the uk , who come to work in the uk , would be entitled to vote , " guerin said .

washington dc residents walter myers , 72 , and gwendolyn myers , 71 , are accused of acting as illegal agents for cuba and wire fraud .
the couple could face up to 20 years in prison if found guilty .
the arrest follows a sting operation by the fbi , in which an agent posing as a cuban spy persuaded the couple to give him information about their activities .
mr myers first began working for the us state department in 1977 as an instructor at the foreign service institute , where he was given " top secret " security clearance .
in 1999 , he was granted an even higher security clearance when he joined the state department 's bureau of intelligence and research -lrb- inr -rrb- on a permanent basis .
he retired in 2007 .
according to the justice department , in the previous year alone , he used his computer to view about 200 sensitive or classified documents relating to cuba .
supermarket spies mr myers married his wife gwendolyn in 1982 .
she worked as an analyst at a washington dc bank , and was never granted security clearance by the us government .
mr myers was first approached by the cuban government in 1978 , the justice department says , and he and his wife agreed shortly afterwards to provide information to cuban intelligence .
the bbc 's james coomarasamy says the couple told the undercover fbi agent that they were known as agents 202 and 123 , that they had personally met cuba 's former leader fidel castro .
mrs myers 's preferred method of of passing on secrets was to exchange shopping trolleys in a grocery store , the justice department says .
an affidavit released by the department revealed details of the sting operation conducted by the fbi .
it says an undercover agent posing as a member of the cuban intelligence service approached mr myers , telling him that he had been sent by the cuban government to obtain information from him .
during a subsequent meeting , mr myers and his wife agreed to provide information about us government personnel to the undercover agent , and made statements about their past activities for the cuban government , the affidavit alleges .
