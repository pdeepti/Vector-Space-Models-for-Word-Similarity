the us and south korea have reacted by putting their troops on high alert .
and the un security council members are discussing new sanctions against pyongyang after it conducted another nuclear test on monday .
many experts think that north korea has been trying to catch president obama ’ s attention and influence us foreign policy - which in the recent past has vacillated between confrontation and dialogue . the sabre-rattling that north korea indulged in this week by conducting a second nuclear test and testing ballistic missiles is part of a decade-long tug of war between the isolated communist state and the united states .
“ north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil . ”
this was us president george w. bush making his first state of the nation address in january 2002 .
speaking in the aftermath of the 2001 september 11th attacks on the united states , he and many others were worried that kim jong il ’ s regime might supply terrorist networks with fissile material .
his aggressive rhetoric tone was met with fears in north korea that the us might attack .
six nation disarmament talks between the two koreas , the us , russia , japan and china stalled .
when they once again restarted in 2005 , pyongyang demanded a pact of non-aggression with the us .
" we ’ re peaceful people , ” insisted bush , however .
“ we have no intention of invading north korea .
south korea has no intention of attacking north korea .
we ’ re purely defensive . ”
a constant to-and-fro the us found another means of putting pressure on pyongyang - cutting its financial supplies by putting pressure on banks .
in october 2006 , north korea tested its first nuclear bomb - and got concessions in return .
the six nation talks were re-launched and gained momentum .
pyongyang was promised supplies of urgently-needed oil in return for shutting down and dismantling its yongbyon nuclear reactor and being transparent about its atomic programme .
the bush administration softened its stance and even announced an end to sanctions in spring 2008 .
bush also said : “ i am notifying congress of my intent to rescind north korea ’ s designation as a state sponsor of terror in 45 days . ”
tug of war dates back to clinton although bush had his part to play in the tug of war between the us and north korea , the history dates back to the clinton era .
in 1994 , president bill clinton ordered plans for an attack on north korea to be prepared .
later , he sent former president jimmy carter on a peace mission to pyongyang .
a comprehensive treaty was signed after the north korean government promised to stop all its nuclear activities : pyongyang was promised economic aid and a plan to build a modern light water reactor with us help was also floated .
clinton had high hopes and announced in 1994 that “ after 16 months of intense and difficult negotiations with north korea we have completed an agreement that will make the united states , the korean peninsula and the world safer . ”
but these hopes were short-lived .
north korea did not keep its side of the deal .
it started working secretly on uranium enrichment .
so when bush arrived tension was brewing .
n korea could be banking on an olive branch from obama kim jong il must have observed the president barack obama ’ s recent overtures to iran , another “ axis of evil ” power , with an interested eye .
he might also have a similar olive branch in mind .
even though pyongyang quit the six nation talks once again in april , history has shown that they can be revived .
the bankrupt regime on the northern korean peninsula might thus be able to acquire not only some much-needed economic aid but also some political clout .

many experts think that north korea has been trying to catch president obama ’ s attention and influence us foreign policy - which in the recent past has vacillated between confrontation and dialogue . the sabre-rattling that north korea indulged in this week by conducting a second nuclear test and testing ballistic missiles is part of a decade-long tug of war between the isolated communist state and the united states .
“ north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil . ”
this was us president george w. bush making his first state of the nation address in january 2002 .
speaking in the aftermath of the 2001 september 11th attacks on the united states , he and many others were worried that kim jong il ’ s regime might supply terrorist networks with fissile material .
his aggressive rhetoric tone was met with fears in north korea that the us might attack .
six nation disarmament talks between the two koreas , the us , russia , japan and china stalled .
when they once again restarted in 2005 , pyongyang demanded a pact of non-aggression with the us .
" we ’ re peaceful people , ” insisted bush , however .
“ we have no intention of invading north korea .
south korea has no intention of attacking north korea .
we ’ re purely defensive . ”
a constant to-and-fro the us found another means of putting pressure on pyongyang - cutting its financial supplies by putting pressure on banks .
in october 2006 , north korea tested its first nuclear bomb - and got concessions in return .
the six nation talks were re-launched and gained momentum .
pyongyang was promised supplies of urgently-needed oil in return for shutting down and dismantling its yongbyon nuclear reactor and being transparent about its atomic programme .
the bush administration softened its stance and even announced an end to sanctions in spring 2008 .
bush also said : “ i am notifying congress of my intent to rescind north korea ’ s designation as a state sponsor of terror in 45 days . ”
tug of war dates back to clinton although bush had his part to play in the tug of war between the us and north korea , the history dates back to the clinton era .
in 1994 , president bill clinton ordered plans for an attack on north korea to be prepared .
later , he sent former president jimmy carter on a peace mission to pyongyang .
a comprehensive treaty was signed after the north korean government promised to stop all its nuclear activities : pyongyang was promised economic aid and a plan to build a modern light water reactor with us help was also floated .
clinton had high hopes and announced in 1994 that “ after 16 months of intense and difficult negotiations with north korea we have completed an agreement that will make the united states , the korean peninsula and the world safer . ”
but these hopes were short-lived .
north korea did not keep its side of the deal .
it started working secretly on uranium enrichment .
so when bush arrived tension was brewing .
n korea could be banking on an olive branch from obama kim jong il must have observed the president barack obama ’ s recent overtures to iran , another “ axis of evil ” power , with an interested eye .
he might also have a similar olive branch in mind .
even though pyongyang quit the six nation talks once again in april , history has shown that they can be revived .
the bankrupt regime on the northern korean peninsula might thus be able to acquire not only some much-needed economic aid but also some political clout .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

but getting the laws through the upper house will be more difficult . the new draft laws make it illegal for people to provide instructions on how to commit serious violent crimes .
this includes distributing information on the internet on how to build bombs .
furthermore , suspects convicted of teaching or undertaking training in terrorism camps could be sent to prison for ten years .
the federal justice minister , brigitte zypries , said that the law completes the grand coalition 's criminal reform agenda .
“ even criminals who have no direct ties to a terror organisation can now be put behind bars , ” she said .
authorities must , however , provide evidence that such individuals actually intend to carry out an act of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the head of germany 's police union says the laws might work in theory , but not in practice it is precisely the obligation to prove intent that may cause the widely publicised new laws to be blocked in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . the spd / cdu-csu coalition does not have an absolute majority there and will need support from the smaller parties : the fdp , the greens and the left .
all three parties voted against the new laws in the bundestag on thursday .
proving intent is almost impossible , says police union the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , told the friday edition of the local daily , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , that he believes the laws will be almost impossible to implement .
“ if there is evidence that someone has completed a training course in terror , that should be sufficient to send that person to prison .
but it will be almost impossible to prove additionally that that person was planning to carry out a terror attack , " he said . wl / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .

the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .

reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .

the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .

reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .

among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble was under pressure to toughen gun laws after the march rampage in germany , there are over 365,000 registered hunters .
to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 28.05.2009 barcelona outclass manchester united to take champions league final großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's samuel eto 'o , right , opened the scoring early on in a dominant performance , samuel eto 'o and lionel messi fired the catalans past the english champions . it was the biggest date in the european club game : the uefa champions league final , and the match-up was precisely the one connoisseurs of the game had been hoping for – cup holders manchester united and spanish giants fc barcelona .
both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .
after the parliamentary elections in april , the opposition said the vote was rigged and stormed government buildings in protest .
" we are ready for negotiations but one of the conditions is that voronin quit all his posts , " said serafim urechean , head of the our moldova party .
" the communists have turned everything in the country and in parliament itself into a farce . " hf / dpa / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .

an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .

" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .

“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .

the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .

“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .

the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .

critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 28.05.2009 unemployment rate drops - but only slightly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment numbers usually drop significantly in the spring but not this year unemployment continues to plague the german economy , according to new official figures .
experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .

these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .

solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .

washington , on the other hand , seemed to consider the meeting to be a lower priority , sending only a low-ranking us treasury representative , who reportedly contributed little to the discussions .
other treasury officials are reported to have taken part in the proceedings via video conference .
the ceos of the three main bidding firms , magna , fiat , and ripplewood international , were also in attendance .
a potential fourth suitor , the chinese carmaker beijing automotive industry holding company -lrb- baic -rrb- , is reported to have entered the race on tuesday , but baic executives refused to confirm or deny their opel bid .
three-hundred-million-euro stumbling block the goal of the emergency summit was to determine which company should eventually take over opel .
this was put on ice almost immediately , however , after gm made a surprise demand for further loans to keep opel afloat for the time being .
reports said gm had asked for an extra 300 million euros , -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- which is in addition to the 1.5 billion euros that germany has already pledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel continues to rob german politicians of sleep the new demands were a source of considerable frustration for both economics minister guttenberg and finance minister peer steinbrück .
after the talks , steinbrück said it would be too dangerous to dump more money into a deal he called “ unsafe ” to begin with , adding that he could n't allow german taxpayers ' money to simply flow into the us parent company .
or , as guttenberg put it , “ we have to at least be able to see the other shore before building a bridge . ”

but getting the laws through the upper house will be more difficult . the new draft laws make it illegal for people to provide instructions on how to commit serious violent crimes .
this includes distributing information on the internet on how to build bombs .
furthermore , suspects convicted of teaching or undertaking training in terrorism camps could be sent to prison for ten years .
the federal justice minister , brigitte zypries , said that the law completes the grand coalition 's criminal reform agenda .
“ even criminals who have no direct ties to a terror organisation can now be put behind bars , ” she said .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de human rights -pipe- 28.05.2009 interview with amnesty international on the world human rights report 2009 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report makes grim reading amnesty international has released its annual report : " the state of the world 's human rights . "
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 28.05.2009 when is a tweet a twitter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 32 million members worldwide give vent to their thoughts " twittergate furore in berlin as early birdsong reveals poll result ! "
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .
we live in an age where " one small tweet can too much twitter make " but where twitter may just also help keep censorship at bay . author : tanya wood editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but getting the laws through the upper house will be more difficult . the new draft laws make it illegal for people to provide instructions on how to commit serious violent crimes .
this includes distributing information on the internet on how to build bombs .
furthermore , suspects convicted of teaching or undertaking training in terrorism camps could be sent to prison for ten years .
the federal justice minister , brigitte zypries , said that the law completes the grand coalition 's criminal reform agenda .
“ even criminals who have no direct ties to a terror organisation can now be put behind bars , ” she said .
authorities must , however , provide evidence that such individuals actually intend to carry out an act of terrorism .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the head of germany 's police union says the laws might work in theory , but not in practice it is precisely the obligation to prove intent that may cause the widely publicised new laws to be blocked in the bundesrat , the upper house of parliament . the spd / cdu-csu coalition does not have an absolute majority there and will need support from the smaller parties : the fdp , the greens and the left .
all three parties voted against the new laws in the bundestag on thursday .
proving intent is almost impossible , says police union the head of the police union , konrad freiberg , told the friday edition of the local daily , the koelner stadt-anzeiger , that he believes the laws will be almost impossible to implement .
“ if there is evidence that someone has completed a training course in terror , that should be sufficient to send that person to prison .
but it will be almost impossible to prove additionally that that person was planning to carry out a terror attack , " he said . wl / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 28.05.2009 germany one step closer to tougher gun laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's gun laws are already some of the toughest in europe in response to a march school shooting , in which a teenager shot 15 people dead , the german cabinet has introduced amendments to germany 's gun laws , which would further restrict all gun owners in the country . under legislation to be put to a vote in parliament next month , germany 's gun owners , who number between 10 and 12 million , would be subject to unannounced random checks of how and where they store their weapons .
if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble was under pressure to toughen gun laws after the march rampage in germany , there are over 365,000 registered hunters .
to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble was under pressure to toughen gun laws after the march rampage in germany , there are over 365,000 registered hunters .
to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 28.05.2009 when is a tweet a twitter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 32 million members worldwide give vent to their thoughts " twittergate furore in berlin as early birdsong reveals poll result ! "
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .
we live in an age where " one small tweet can too much twitter make " but where twitter may just also help keep censorship at bay . author : tanya wood editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9799 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

illegal construction at the time those costs were recorded , gorleben had permits only to test the feasibility of turning the site into a nuclear waste dump .
however , kersten ruedeck , who heads a german environmental organization , says that , by that time , work had already begun on the construction of a nuclear waste storage site .
“ our worst fears have come true .
in gorleben they were n't only testing , but had already started building the storage site years earlier , ” she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands turn out to protest whenever nuclear waste is shipped to the site spark for environmentalists ?
gorleben is one of two nuclear waste storage sites in germany .
shipments of waste to the site regularly spark angry protests , and those opposed to the use of nuclear energy in germany are hoping that thursday 's allegations could lead to gorleben being shut down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have called on gabriel to close down gorleben this is something , says ruedeck , that the organizations have been seeking for years .
“ the report confirms our position that gorleben must be shut down as soon as possible .
this must not be tolerated .
it 's illegal to begin construction without a permit and without official plans to do so - and then to lie to the public about it .
gorleben must be done away with , ” she said .
ruedeck and fellow environmentalists are now hoping that environment minister sigmar gabriel will take swift action to close the site down. glb / dpa / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .

these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .

well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .
“ the government does n't have an income problem , they have a problem with the way they spend taxpayers ' money . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .
we live in an age where " one small tweet can too much twitter make " but where twitter may just also help keep censorship at bay . author : tanya wood editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .

“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 28.05.2009 unemployment rate drops - but only slightly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment numbers usually drop significantly in the spring but not this year unemployment continues to plague the german economy , according to new official figures .
experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .

the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian premier said that if someone asked if he had " a spicy or more than spicy " relationship with a minor , his answer would be " absolutely not . "
the age of consent for sex in italy is 16 but people under 18 are considered minors .
berlusconi added that if he lied about the relationship he would have to resign .
" i swore this on the heads of my children and i said i am aware that , should i have committed perjury , i would have to resign a minute later , " he said .
controversy triggered by divorce plea italy 's media reported last month that berlusconi attended the 18th birthday party of model noemi letizia in naples and gave her an expensive necklace .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : noemi letizia is at the heart of the political scandal in italy the incident sparked political controversy after berlusconi 's wife , veronica lario , cited the episode when she announced earlier this month that she would divorce the conservative premier . she criticized her husband for attending the party and for spending the night at a naples disco celebrating letizia 's birthday .
berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing and insists that he met letizia through her parents whom he has known for many years .
he said he stopped by the party because he happened to be in naples that day .
berlusconi 's children furious the scandal comes as berlusconi 's center-right people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party is campaigning for next month 's european parliament elections .
berlusconi has said the allegations are part of a political smear campaign against him .
the media magnate has promised to explain his behavior in parliament but has not yet set a date .
italy 's opposition has seized on the affair and demanded clarification .
on thursday , berlusconi 's children reacted angrily to a comment made by center-left leader dario franceschini on the campaign trail this week .
" italian men and women , would you have berlusconi raise your children ? "
franceschini asked .
" angry ?
i am indignant .
furious .
no , this is enough , " marina berlusconi , the italian premier 's daughter from his first marriage , told newspaper corriere della sera .
" this time , i do n't intend to stay silent … my father has always worked a lot , but there has never been a time , a single time , in which i did not have him near when i needed him , " the 42-year-old said. sp / ap / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

washington , on the other hand , seemed to consider the meeting to be a lower priority , sending only a low-ranking us treasury representative , who reportedly contributed little to the discussions .
other treasury officials are reported to have taken part in the proceedings via video conference .
the ceos of the three main bidding firms , magna , fiat , and ripplewood international , were also in attendance .
a potential fourth suitor , the chinese carmaker beijing automotive industry holding company -lrb- baic -rrb- , is reported to have entered the race on tuesday , but baic executives refused to confirm or deny their opel bid .
three-hundred-million-euro stumbling block the goal of the emergency summit was to determine which company should eventually take over opel .
this was put on ice almost immediately , however , after gm made a surprise demand for further loans to keep opel afloat for the time being .
reports said gm had asked for an extra 300 million euros , -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- which is in addition to the 1.5 billion euros that germany has already pledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel continues to rob german politicians of sleep the new demands were a source of considerable frustration for both economics minister guttenberg and finance minister peer steinbrück .
after the talks , steinbrück said it would be too dangerous to dump more money into a deal he called “ unsafe ” to begin with , adding that he could n't allow german taxpayers ' money to simply flow into the us parent company .
or , as guttenberg put it , “ we have to at least be able to see the other shore before building a bridge . ”

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .
“ the government does n't have an income problem , they have a problem with the way they spend taxpayers ' money . "
criticism has also come from the confederation of german trade unions -lrb- dgb -rrb- . wl / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de vat increase puts germany closer to eu average the 3 percent value-added tax increase that was part of chancellor angela merkel 's election campaign did n't come as a surprise to anyone in germany , but that does n't mean everyone is willing to accept it .

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?

" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

washington , on the other hand , seemed to consider the meeting to be a lower priority , sending only a low-ranking us treasury representative , who reportedly contributed little to the discussions .
other treasury officials are reported to have taken part in the proceedings via video conference .
the ceos of the three main bidding firms , magna , fiat , and ripplewood international , were also in attendance .
a potential fourth suitor , the chinese carmaker beijing automotive industry holding company -lrb- baic -rrb- , is reported to have entered the race on tuesday , but baic executives refused to confirm or deny their opel bid .
three-hundred-million-euro stumbling block the goal of the emergency summit was to determine which company should eventually take over opel .
this was put on ice almost immediately , however , after gm made a surprise demand for further loans to keep opel afloat for the time being .
reports said gm had asked for an extra 300 million euros , -lrb- $ 426 million -rrb- which is in addition to the 1.5 billion euros that germany has already pledged .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel continues to rob german politicians of sleep the new demands were a source of considerable frustration for both economics minister guttenberg and finance minister peer steinbrück .
after the talks , steinbrück said it would be too dangerous to dump more money into a deal he called “ unsafe ” to begin with , adding that he could n't allow german taxpayers ' money to simply flow into the us parent company .
or , as guttenberg put it , “ we have to at least be able to see the other shore before building a bridge . ”

ripplewood out of next round at the end of the several-hours-long meeting , the parties involved agreed to continue negotiations on friday , which are to include german and us government officials and representatives from gm-europe and the two remaining bidders magna and fiat .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 28.05.2009 unemployment rate drops - but only slightly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment numbers usually drop significantly in the spring but not this year unemployment continues to plague the german economy , according to new official figures .
experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .

these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .

1 , 1939 .
nearly 70 years later , a new exhibit in berlin 's german historical museum focuses on the rocky history of german-polish ties . around 750 photographs , documents , works of art and other historical items - many from personal collections - go on display in berlin on thursday , may 28 . organized in memory of the beginning of the nazi plan of eastward expansion , the exhibit highlights their 1939 invasion via gdansk as well as the brutal nazi occupation of poland through 1945 . the exhibit begins by examining ties between the neighbors in the 18th century , when present-day poland was partitioned between russia , prussia and austria , and continues to after world war ii , looking at the expulsion of germans from poland after 1945 , cold war relations and recent reconciliation efforts . different takes on history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman mourns for her sister , who was shot as nazi soldiers entered poland in 1939 the way history is viewed and taught in both countries has differed dramatically - but is also a key factor in encouraging reconciliation . " the poles concentrate on the battles that took place in poland during world war ii , on the fight within poland against hitler 's germany and on the other theaters of war , " historian michael mueller told deutsche welle .
" and of course they 're concerned with the suffering of the polish people . " when they think of war crimes , the germans are mainly concerned with the crimes of the soviet union , but of course also with the holocaust and their own suffering , " he added . mueller has led a joint german-polish school text book committee for the past 10 years .
he said polish school books always contained a lot of information about germany , even if it was n't always correct .
the bigger problem , however , was that poland was often not even mentioned at all in german text books . to correct that , mueller 's committee has made recommendations on what should be included in school books in both countries and prepared materials for teachers to use in class . similarities waiting to be discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many programs connect german and polish youth another effective approach to reconciliation has been exchange programs that allow germans to visit poland and vice versa . johannes hering , a 20-year-old from germany , said he 's enthusiastic about getting to know poland and also about helping other germans appreciate their neighbor to the east . he has spent time in poland caring for a few of the 18,000 holocaust survivors , now in their 80s , who live in the country , and is considering returning to poland to study . " you have to work on finding out what you have in common , " said hering .
" germany and poland have a common history that is full of suffering .
but it 's also important to find similarities that help you look toward the future . " readiness to forgive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bartoszewski says he 's willing to forgive poland 's former foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski knows about suffering .
he was 17 when world war ii broke out and later spent one year as a concentration camp prisoner in auschwitz .
yet he has continually been active in supporting german-polish reconciliation , both as foreign minister and now as poland 's special envoy for german relations . " one can forgive and , as a christian , one should want and be able to forgive when somebody admits their guilt , expresses regret and awaits forgiveness , " said bartoszewski . " but how can i talk about forgiveness regarding people who were n't even born during those critical times ? " he continued .
" no one bears guilt for deeds he did n't commit himself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german historical museum museum is a berlin landmark german minister of state for culture bernd neumann and poland 's culture minister bogdan zdrojewski officially opened the exhibit on wednesday .
at the event in berlin 's ephraim palace , the ministers signed a joint declaration paving the way for a european network for memory and solidarity . based in warsaw , the network is to begin its work later this year , focusing on the analysis , documentation and distribution of information about the past .
hungary and slovakia are expected to sign the declaration later in warsaw . the exhibit , entitled " germans and poles : abysses and hope , " runs in the german historical museum through sept .

1 , 1939 .
nearly 70 years later , a new exhibit in berlin 's german historical museum focuses on the rocky history of german-polish ties . around 750 photographs , documents , works of art and other historical items - many from personal collections - go on display in berlin on thursday , may 28 . organized in memory of the beginning of the nazi plan of eastward expansion , the exhibit highlights their 1939 invasion via gdansk as well as the brutal nazi occupation of poland through 1945 . the exhibit begins by examining ties between the neighbors in the 18th century , when present-day poland was partitioned between russia , prussia and austria , and continues to after world war ii , looking at the expulsion of germans from poland after 1945 , cold war relations and recent reconciliation efforts . different takes on history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman mourns for her sister , who was shot as nazi soldiers entered poland in 1939 the way history is viewed and taught in both countries has differed dramatically - but is also a key factor in encouraging reconciliation . " the poles concentrate on the battles that took place in poland during world war ii , on the fight within poland against hitler 's germany and on the other theaters of war , " historian michael mueller told deutsche welle .
" and of course they 're concerned with the suffering of the polish people . " when they think of war crimes , the germans are mainly concerned with the crimes of the soviet union , but of course also with the holocaust and their own suffering , " he added . mueller has led a joint german-polish school text book committee for the past 10 years .
he said polish school books always contained a lot of information about germany , even if it was n't always correct .
the bigger problem , however , was that poland was often not even mentioned at all in german text books . to correct that , mueller 's committee has made recommendations on what should be included in school books in both countries and prepared materials for teachers to use in class . similarities waiting to be discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many programs connect german and polish youth another effective approach to reconciliation has been exchange programs that allow germans to visit poland and vice versa . johannes hering , a 20-year-old from germany , said he 's enthusiastic about getting to know poland and also about helping other germans appreciate their neighbor to the east . he has spent time in poland caring for a few of the 18,000 holocaust survivors , now in their 80s , who live in the country , and is considering returning to poland to study . " you have to work on finding out what you have in common , " said hering .
" germany and poland have a common history that is full of suffering .
but it 's also important to find similarities that help you look toward the future . " readiness to forgive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bartoszewski says he 's willing to forgive poland 's former foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski knows about suffering .
he was 17 when world war ii broke out and later spent one year as a concentration camp prisoner in auschwitz .
yet he has continually been active in supporting german-polish reconciliation , both as foreign minister and now as poland 's special envoy for german relations . " one can forgive and , as a christian , one should want and be able to forgive when somebody admits their guilt , expresses regret and awaits forgiveness , " said bartoszewski . " but how can i talk about forgiveness regarding people who were n't even born during those critical times ? " he continued .
" no one bears guilt for deeds he did n't commit himself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german historical museum museum is a berlin landmark german minister of state for culture bernd neumann and poland 's culture minister bogdan zdrojewski officially opened the exhibit on wednesday .
at the event in berlin 's ephraim palace , the ministers signed a joint declaration paving the way for a european network for memory and solidarity . based in warsaw , the network is to begin its work later this year , focusing on the analysis , documentation and distribution of information about the past .
hungary and slovakia are expected to sign the declaration later in warsaw . the exhibit , entitled " germans and poles : abysses and hope , " runs in the german historical museum through sept .

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights . " business needs stability , and stability comes from respect for human rights . " amnesty criticized the group of 20 nations for claiming the " mantle of world leadership " while their own records on human rights were " tarnished . " " the new leadership of the g20 is marred by old , failed approaches to human rights , " khan said . problems around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is taken to task for its treatment of sinti and roma in 2008 , the period covered in the report , 78 percent of all executions took place in g20 member states , with the united states , china and saudi arabia accounting for the highest number of executions , the report shows . in europe , amnesty highlights problems ranging from the use of cluster munitions during the brief georgia-russia war , to widespread discrimination against ethnic minorities . " migrants , roma , jews and muslims were among those subjected to hate crimes by individuals or extremist groups , " amnesty 's report says . but the human rights group 's report is n't all gloomy .
amnesty says states could deal with the wreckage of the economic crisis by rebuilding in a socially aware manner . " the state has been retreating or reneging on its human rights obligations in favor of the market in the belief that economic growth would lift all boats , " khan said .

if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .

to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internet -pipe- 28.05.2009 when is a tweet a twitter ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : up to 32 million members worldwide give vent to their thoughts " twittergate furore in berlin as early birdsong reveals poll result ! "
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .

" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .
we live in an age where " one small tweet can too much twitter make " but where twitter may just also help keep censorship at bay . author : tanya wood editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ? 9797 radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .

two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .
“ the government does n't have an income problem , they have a problem with the way they spend taxpayers ' money . "

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .

“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .
after the parliamentary elections in april , the opposition said the vote was rigged and stormed government buildings in protest .
" we are ready for negotiations but one of the conditions is that voronin quit all his posts , " said serafim urechean , head of the our moldova party .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german law -pipe- 28.05.2009 germany one step closer to tougher gun laws großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's gun laws are already some of the toughest in europe in response to a march school shooting , in which a teenager shot 15 people dead , the german cabinet has introduced amendments to germany 's gun laws , which would further restrict all gun owners in the country . under legislation to be put to a vote in parliament next month , germany 's gun owners , who number between 10 and 12 million , would be subject to unannounced random checks of how and where they store their weapons .
if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble was under pressure to toughen gun laws after the march rampage in germany , there are over 365,000 registered hunters .
to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .

to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights . " business needs stability , and stability comes from respect for human rights . " amnesty criticized the group of 20 nations for claiming the " mantle of world leadership " while their own records on human rights were " tarnished . " " the new leadership of the g20 is marred by old , failed approaches to human rights , " khan said . problems around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is taken to task for its treatment of sinti and roma in 2008 , the period covered in the report , 78 percent of all executions took place in g20 member states , with the united states , china and saudi arabia accounting for the highest number of executions , the report shows . in europe , amnesty highlights problems ranging from the use of cluster munitions during the brief georgia-russia war , to widespread discrimination against ethnic minorities . " migrants , roma , jews and muslims were among those subjected to hate crimes by individuals or extremist groups , " amnesty 's report says . but the human rights group 's report is n't all gloomy .
amnesty says states could deal with the wreckage of the economic crisis by rebuilding in a socially aware manner . " the state has been retreating or reneging on its human rights obligations in favor of the market in the belief that economic growth would lift all boats , " khan said .
" with the tide receding and boats springing leaks , governments are radically changing their positions and talking about a new global financial architecture and international governance system in which the state plays a stronger role ... than the one that has characterized international policy-making for the past 20 years .

response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .

just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .
after the parliamentary elections in april , the opposition said the vote was rigged and stormed government buildings in protest .
" we are ready for negotiations but one of the conditions is that voronin quit all his posts , " said serafim urechean , head of the our moldova party .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .
after the parliamentary elections in april , the opposition said the vote was rigged and stormed government buildings in protest .
" we are ready for negotiations but one of the conditions is that voronin quit all his posts , " said serafim urechean , head of the our moldova party .

1 , 1939 .
nearly 70 years later , a new exhibit in berlin 's german historical museum focuses on the rocky history of german-polish ties . around 750 photographs , documents , works of art and other historical items - many from personal collections - go on display in berlin on thursday , may 28 . organized in memory of the beginning of the nazi plan of eastward expansion , the exhibit highlights their 1939 invasion via gdansk as well as the brutal nazi occupation of poland through 1945 . the exhibit begins by examining ties between the neighbors in the 18th century , when present-day poland was partitioned between russia , prussia and austria , and continues to after world war ii , looking at the expulsion of germans from poland after 1945 , cold war relations and recent reconciliation efforts . different takes on history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman mourns for her sister , who was shot as nazi soldiers entered poland in 1939 the way history is viewed and taught in both countries has differed dramatically - but is also a key factor in encouraging reconciliation . " the poles concentrate on the battles that took place in poland during world war ii , on the fight within poland against hitler 's germany and on the other theaters of war , " historian michael mueller told deutsche welle .
" and of course they 're concerned with the suffering of the polish people . " when they think of war crimes , the germans are mainly concerned with the crimes of the soviet union , but of course also with the holocaust and their own suffering , " he added . mueller has led a joint german-polish school text book committee for the past 10 years .
he said polish school books always contained a lot of information about germany , even if it was n't always correct .
the bigger problem , however , was that poland was often not even mentioned at all in german text books . to correct that , mueller 's committee has made recommendations on what should be included in school books in both countries and prepared materials for teachers to use in class . similarities waiting to be discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many programs connect german and polish youth another effective approach to reconciliation has been exchange programs that allow germans to visit poland and vice versa . johannes hering , a 20-year-old from germany , said he 's enthusiastic about getting to know poland and also about helping other germans appreciate their neighbor to the east . he has spent time in poland caring for a few of the 18,000 holocaust survivors , now in their 80s , who live in the country , and is considering returning to poland to study . " you have to work on finding out what you have in common , " said hering .
" germany and poland have a common history that is full of suffering .
but it 's also important to find similarities that help you look toward the future . " readiness to forgive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bartoszewski says he 's willing to forgive poland 's former foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski knows about suffering .
he was 17 when world war ii broke out and later spent one year as a concentration camp prisoner in auschwitz .
yet he has continually been active in supporting german-polish reconciliation , both as foreign minister and now as poland 's special envoy for german relations . " one can forgive and , as a christian , one should want and be able to forgive when somebody admits their guilt , expresses regret and awaits forgiveness , " said bartoszewski . " but how can i talk about forgiveness regarding people who were n't even born during those critical times ? " he continued .
" no one bears guilt for deeds he did n't commit himself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german historical museum museum is a berlin landmark german minister of state for culture bernd neumann and poland 's culture minister bogdan zdrojewski officially opened the exhibit on wednesday .
at the event in berlin 's ephraim palace , the ministers signed a joint declaration paving the way for a european network for memory and solidarity . based in warsaw , the network is to begin its work later this year , focusing on the analysis , documentation and distribution of information about the past .
hungary and slovakia are expected to sign the declaration later in warsaw . the exhibit , entitled " germans and poles : abysses and hope , " runs in the german historical museum through sept .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .

an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "

a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

environmentalists in the area say this is proof enough that more was going on in gorleben than the authorities admit to .
illegal construction at the time those costs were recorded , gorleben had permits only to test the feasibility of turning the site into a nuclear waste dump .

it 's illegal to begin construction without a permit and without official plans to do so - and then to lie to the public about it .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .
“ the government does n't have an income problem , they have a problem with the way they spend taxpayers ' money . "

africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .

so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

franceschini asked .
" angry ?
i am indignant .

no , this is enough , " marina berlusconi , the italian premier 's daughter from his first marriage , told newspaper corriere della sera .
" this time , i do n't intend to stay silent … my father has always worked a lot , but there has never been a time , a single time , in which i did not have him near when i needed him , " the 42-year-old said. sp / ap / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 28.05.2009 socialists lose monopoly on socialist policies großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no big boost from the crisis for european socialists banks are being nationalized , ceo 's salaries are being curbed and the financial system is being restructured .
those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .

other treasury officials are reported to have taken part in the proceedings via video conference .
the ceos of the three main bidding firms , magna , fiat , and ripplewood international , were also in attendance .
a potential fourth suitor , the chinese carmaker beijing automotive industry holding company -lrb- baic -rrb- , is reported to have entered the race on tuesday , but baic executives refused to confirm or deny their opel bid .
three-hundred-million-euro stumbling block the goal of the emergency summit was to determine which company should eventually take over opel .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel continues to rob german politicians of sleep the new demands were a source of considerable frustration for both economics minister guttenberg and finance minister peer steinbrück .
after the talks , steinbrück said it would be too dangerous to dump more money into a deal he called “ unsafe ” to begin with , adding that he could n't allow german taxpayers ' money to simply flow into the us parent company .
or , as guttenberg put it , “ we have to at least be able to see the other shore before building a bridge . ”

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .

these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights . " business needs stability , and stability comes from respect for human rights . " amnesty criticized the group of 20 nations for claiming the " mantle of world leadership " while their own records on human rights were " tarnished . " " the new leadership of the g20 is marred by old , failed approaches to human rights , " khan said . problems around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is taken to task for its treatment of sinti and roma in 2008 , the period covered in the report , 78 percent of all executions took place in g20 member states , with the united states , china and saudi arabia accounting for the highest number of executions , the report shows . in europe , amnesty highlights problems ranging from the use of cluster munitions during the brief georgia-russia war , to widespread discrimination against ethnic minorities . " migrants , roma , jews and muslims were among those subjected to hate crimes by individuals or extremist groups , " amnesty 's report says . but the human rights group 's report is n't all gloomy .
amnesty says states could deal with the wreckage of the economic crisis by rebuilding in a socially aware manner . " the state has been retreating or reneging on its human rights obligations in favor of the market in the belief that economic growth would lift all boats , " khan said .
" with the tide receding and boats springing leaks , governments are radically changing their positions and talking about a new global financial architecture and international governance system in which the state plays a stronger role ... than the one that has characterized international policy-making for the past 20 years .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

the italian premier said that if someone asked if he had " a spicy or more than spicy " relationship with a minor , his answer would be " absolutely not . "
the age of consent for sex in italy is 16 but people under 18 are considered minors .
berlusconi added that if he lied about the relationship he would have to resign .

berlusconi has denied any wrongdoing and insists that he met letizia through her parents whom he has known for many years .
he said he stopped by the party because he happened to be in naples that day .
berlusconi 's children furious the scandal comes as berlusconi 's center-right people of freedom -lrb- pdl -rrb- party is campaigning for next month 's european parliament elections .
berlusconi has said the allegations are part of a political smear campaign against him .
the media magnate has promised to explain his behavior in parliament but has not yet set a date .
italy 's opposition has seized on the affair and demanded clarification .
on thursday , berlusconi 's children reacted angrily to a comment made by center-left leader dario franceschini on the campaign trail this week .
" italian men and women , would you have berlusconi raise your children ? "
franceschini asked .
" angry ?
i am indignant .

no , this is enough , " marina berlusconi , the italian premier 's daughter from his first marriage , told newspaper corriere della sera .
" this time , i do n't intend to stay silent … my father has always worked a lot , but there has never been a time , a single time , in which i did not have him near when i needed him , " the 42-year-old said. sp / ap / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .

these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .

"
" twittergate causes resignations in german politics . " these were the blogs – or tweets – that brought the million-strong social networking tool , twitter , to the forefront of the german parliamentary agenda .
even if " twittergate " was in reality more tweet than twitter . the furore started with two apparently harmless messages typed into the maximum 140-character slot of the us-based twitter web site .
except that the tweets of julia kloeckner of angela merkel 's cdu party and ulrich kelber of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- came 15 minutes before the results of germany 's presidential elections were made official . twitter , which does n't give out member statistics , is estimated to have up to 32 million users worldwide .
hot on the heels of the other popular networking site ‘ facebook , ' twitter offers its members an ongoing stream of global chat , news , tips and , above all , constant connectability . most major newspapers and broadcasters display the twitter logo on their homepages , while newsgatherers now follow twitter reports in the hope of a quick exclusive or the possibility of monitoring eye-witness accounts .
take the g20 demonstrations : the user asks to follow a specific stream of tweeting and can be part of the spontaneity from the safety of his or her laptop , mobile phone , blackberry and so on . celebrity culture can also be nurtured on site as celebrities give a bit by bit account of their day and extend their 15 minutes of fame .
ashton kutcher , actor and husband of us actress demi moore went head to head with us broadcasting giant cnn to see who could get the most twitterers following a tweet .
for what it 's worth , kutcher won . early announcement bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : news of the reelection of president horst köhler was known sooner than expected back in berlin it is essentially the media that are keeping the story a-twitter , but it was enough to introduce the topic into a meeting of parliamentary elders .
these guardians of parliamentary dignity and good conduct have found the breach of conduct distasteful . according to csu party member dorothee baehr , " the dignity of the bundestag really suffered .
it would have been best if the president of the house had been the first one to actually tell everyone the votes for our own president horst koehler and not for the whole internet-media community to know the results before we did . " baehr refrained from too much critique , blaming the whole tweeting episode on election excitement and carelessness . whether the german lower house can take any legal action to stop in-session twittering is dubious .
the spd is considering a ban on its members from sending messages from camera meetings but how this will be effected is unclear . for most politicians , it is simply a matter of protocol .
there are certain things you just do n't do . twitter and internet chatting are less widespread in germany than in other european countries but most parliamentarians are no strangers to technology .
well , at least not now , says baehr . " too much twitter " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most broadcasters have a presence on twitter .
to test the impact of twittergate , this reporter sent out a tweet testing the global temperature .
six hours later there was still not a single reply to my question whether anyone had anything to say about horst koehler 's re-election being announced a quarter of an hour early . nevertheless , kloeckner and kelber had been tweeting from inside a closed session and kelber went so far as to give out the vote count . " the count is confirmed : 613 votes .
koehler is elected , " he tweeted . for her contribution , " watch the football in peace .
the vote was a success , " kloeckner has resigned her position as parliamentary secretary and apologized . tweeting is , according to baehr , an exciting new tool .
people in a position of authority just have to decide when to use it . " every politician has to make up his or her mind whether to use twitter or not , " she said .
" the number of users one year ago was about 30,000 and now a year later it 's 600,000 .
so of course if you want to get in touch with your voters it 's an exciting new possibility .
but you really have to think twice about whether you post news or not . " for non-parliamentarians , twittergate is perhaps less about the dignity of the german bundestag and more about the spread of information into the public domain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 28.05.2009 survey says 31 percent of muslims in europe suffer discrimination großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the report found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination a survey of ethnic minorities in europe says 31 percent of muslims across the eu feel they were discriminated against in 2008 and many fail to report racist incidents because of a lack of trust in the authorities . the report compiled by the european union agency for fundamental rights -lrb- fra -rrb- and published in madrid on thursday surveyed 23,500 members of ethnic minorities and migrant communities in europe .
it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the us and south korea have reacted by putting their troops on high alert .
and the un security council members are discussing new sanctions against pyongyang after it conducted another nuclear test on monday .
many experts think that north korea has been trying to catch president obama ’ s attention and influence us foreign policy - which in the recent past has vacillated between confrontation and dialogue . the sabre-rattling that north korea indulged in this week by conducting a second nuclear test and testing ballistic missiles is part of a decade-long tug of war between the isolated communist state and the united states .
“ north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil . ”
this was us president george w. bush making his first state of the nation address in january 2002 .
speaking in the aftermath of the 2001 september 11th attacks on the united states , he and many others were worried that kim jong il ’ s regime might supply terrorist networks with fissile material .
his aggressive rhetoric tone was met with fears in north korea that the us might attack .
six nation disarmament talks between the two koreas , the us , russia , japan and china stalled .
when they once again restarted in 2005 , pyongyang demanded a pact of non-aggression with the us .
" we ’ re peaceful people , ” insisted bush , however .
“ we have no intention of invading north korea .
south korea has no intention of attacking north korea .
we ’ re purely defensive . ”
a constant to-and-fro the us found another means of putting pressure on pyongyang - cutting its financial supplies by putting pressure on banks .
in october 2006 , north korea tested its first nuclear bomb - and got concessions in return .
the six nation talks were re-launched and gained momentum .
pyongyang was promised supplies of urgently-needed oil in return for shutting down and dismantling its yongbyon nuclear reactor and being transparent about its atomic programme .
the bush administration softened its stance and even announced an end to sanctions in spring 2008 .
bush also said : “ i am notifying congress of my intent to rescind north korea ’ s designation as a state sponsor of terror in 45 days . ”
tug of war dates back to clinton although bush had his part to play in the tug of war between the us and north korea , the history dates back to the clinton era .
in 1994 , president bill clinton ordered plans for an attack on north korea to be prepared .
later , he sent former president jimmy carter on a peace mission to pyongyang .
a comprehensive treaty was signed after the north korean government promised to stop all its nuclear activities : pyongyang was promised economic aid and a plan to build a modern light water reactor with us help was also floated .
clinton had high hopes and announced in 1994 that “ after 16 months of intense and difficult negotiations with north korea we have completed an agreement that will make the united states , the korean peninsula and the world safer . ”
but these hopes were short-lived .
north korea did not keep its side of the deal .
it started working secretly on uranium enrichment .
so when bush arrived tension was brewing .
n korea could be banking on an olive branch from obama kim jong il must have observed the president barack obama ’ s recent overtures to iran , another “ axis of evil ” power , with an interested eye .
he might also have a similar olive branch in mind .
even though pyongyang quit the six nation talks once again in april , history has shown that they can be revived .
the bankrupt regime on the northern korean peninsula might thus be able to acquire not only some much-needed economic aid but also some political clout .

the us and south korea have reacted by putting their troops on high alert .
and the un security council members are discussing new sanctions against pyongyang after it conducted another nuclear test on monday .
many experts think that north korea has been trying to catch president obama ’ s attention and influence us foreign policy - which in the recent past has vacillated between confrontation and dialogue . the sabre-rattling that north korea indulged in this week by conducting a second nuclear test and testing ballistic missiles is part of a decade-long tug of war between the isolated communist state and the united states .
“ north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil . ”
this was us president george w. bush making his first state of the nation address in january 2002 .
speaking in the aftermath of the 2001 september 11th attacks on the united states , he and many others were worried that kim jong il ’ s regime might supply terrorist networks with fissile material .
his aggressive rhetoric tone was met with fears in north korea that the us might attack .
six nation disarmament talks between the two koreas , the us , russia , japan and china stalled .
when they once again restarted in 2005 , pyongyang demanded a pact of non-aggression with the us .
" we ’ re peaceful people , ” insisted bush , however .
“ we have no intention of invading north korea .
south korea has no intention of attacking north korea .
we ’ re purely defensive . ”
a constant to-and-fro the us found another means of putting pressure on pyongyang - cutting its financial supplies by putting pressure on banks .
in october 2006 , north korea tested its first nuclear bomb - and got concessions in return .
the six nation talks were re-launched and gained momentum .
pyongyang was promised supplies of urgently-needed oil in return for shutting down and dismantling its yongbyon nuclear reactor and being transparent about its atomic programme .
the bush administration softened its stance and even announced an end to sanctions in spring 2008 .
bush also said : “ i am notifying congress of my intent to rescind north korea ’ s designation as a state sponsor of terror in 45 days . ”
tug of war dates back to clinton although bush had his part to play in the tug of war between the us and north korea , the history dates back to the clinton era .
in 1994 , president bill clinton ordered plans for an attack on north korea to be prepared .
later , he sent former president jimmy carter on a peace mission to pyongyang .
a comprehensive treaty was signed after the north korean government promised to stop all its nuclear activities : pyongyang was promised economic aid and a plan to build a modern light water reactor with us help was also floated .
clinton had high hopes and announced in 1994 that “ after 16 months of intense and difficult negotiations with north korea we have completed an agreement that will make the united states , the korean peninsula and the world safer . ”
but these hopes were short-lived .
north korea did not keep its side of the deal .
it started working secretly on uranium enrichment .
so when bush arrived tension was brewing .
n korea could be banking on an olive branch from obama kim jong il must have observed the president barack obama ’ s recent overtures to iran , another “ axis of evil ” power , with an interested eye .
he might also have a similar olive branch in mind .
even though pyongyang quit the six nation talks once again in april , history has shown that they can be revived .
the bankrupt regime on the northern korean peninsula might thus be able to acquire not only some much-needed economic aid but also some political clout .

the us and south korea have reacted by putting their troops on high alert .
and the un security council members are discussing new sanctions against pyongyang after it conducted another nuclear test on monday .
many experts think that north korea has been trying to catch president obama ’ s attention and influence us foreign policy - which in the recent past has vacillated between confrontation and dialogue . the sabre-rattling that north korea indulged in this week by conducting a second nuclear test and testing ballistic missiles is part of a decade-long tug of war between the isolated communist state and the united states .
“ north korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction , while starving its citizens .
states like these and their terrorist allies constitute an axis of evil . ”
this was us president george w. bush making his first state of the nation address in january 2002 .
speaking in the aftermath of the 2001 september 11th attacks on the united states , he and many others were worried that kim jong il ’ s regime might supply terrorist networks with fissile material .
his aggressive rhetoric tone was met with fears in north korea that the us might attack .
six nation disarmament talks between the two koreas , the us , russia , japan and china stalled .
when they once again restarted in 2005 , pyongyang demanded a pact of non-aggression with the us .
" we ’ re peaceful people , ” insisted bush , however .
“ we have no intention of invading north korea .
south korea has no intention of attacking north korea .
we ’ re purely defensive . ”
a constant to-and-fro the us found another means of putting pressure on pyongyang - cutting its financial supplies by putting pressure on banks .
in october 2006 , north korea tested its first nuclear bomb - and got concessions in return .
the six nation talks were re-launched and gained momentum .
pyongyang was promised supplies of urgently-needed oil in return for shutting down and dismantling its yongbyon nuclear reactor and being transparent about its atomic programme .
the bush administration softened its stance and even announced an end to sanctions in spring 2008 .
bush also said : “ i am notifying congress of my intent to rescind north korea ’ s designation as a state sponsor of terror in 45 days . ”
tug of war dates back to clinton although bush had his part to play in the tug of war between the us and north korea , the history dates back to the clinton era .
in 1994 , president bill clinton ordered plans for an attack on north korea to be prepared .
later , he sent former president jimmy carter on a peace mission to pyongyang .
a comprehensive treaty was signed after the north korean government promised to stop all its nuclear activities : pyongyang was promised economic aid and a plan to build a modern light water reactor with us help was also floated .
clinton had high hopes and announced in 1994 that “ after 16 months of intense and difficult negotiations with north korea we have completed an agreement that will make the united states , the korean peninsula and the world safer . ”
but these hopes were short-lived .
north korea did not keep its side of the deal .
it started working secretly on uranium enrichment .
so when bush arrived tension was brewing .
n korea could be banking on an olive branch from obama kim jong il must have observed the president barack obama ’ s recent overtures to iran , another “ axis of evil ” power , with an interested eye .
he might also have a similar olive branch in mind .
even though pyongyang quit the six nation talks once again in april , history has shown that they can be revived .
the bankrupt regime on the northern korean peninsula might thus be able to acquire not only some much-needed economic aid but also some political clout .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

1 , 1939 .
nearly 70 years later , a new exhibit in berlin 's german historical museum focuses on the rocky history of german-polish ties . around 750 photographs , documents , works of art and other historical items - many from personal collections - go on display in berlin on thursday , may 28 . organized in memory of the beginning of the nazi plan of eastward expansion , the exhibit highlights their 1939 invasion via gdansk as well as the brutal nazi occupation of poland through 1945 . the exhibit begins by examining ties between the neighbors in the 18th century , when present-day poland was partitioned between russia , prussia and austria , and continues to after world war ii , looking at the expulsion of germans from poland after 1945 , cold war relations and recent reconciliation efforts . different takes on history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman mourns for her sister , who was shot as nazi soldiers entered poland in 1939 the way history is viewed and taught in both countries has differed dramatically - but is also a key factor in encouraging reconciliation . " the poles concentrate on the battles that took place in poland during world war ii , on the fight within poland against hitler 's germany and on the other theaters of war , " historian michael mueller told deutsche welle .
" and of course they 're concerned with the suffering of the polish people . " when they think of war crimes , the germans are mainly concerned with the crimes of the soviet union , but of course also with the holocaust and their own suffering , " he added . mueller has led a joint german-polish school text book committee for the past 10 years .
he said polish school books always contained a lot of information about germany , even if it was n't always correct .
the bigger problem , however , was that poland was often not even mentioned at all in german text books . to correct that , mueller 's committee has made recommendations on what should be included in school books in both countries and prepared materials for teachers to use in class . similarities waiting to be discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many programs connect german and polish youth another effective approach to reconciliation has been exchange programs that allow germans to visit poland and vice versa . johannes hering , a 20-year-old from germany , said he 's enthusiastic about getting to know poland and also about helping other germans appreciate their neighbor to the east . he has spent time in poland caring for a few of the 18,000 holocaust survivors , now in their 80s , who live in the country , and is considering returning to poland to study . " you have to work on finding out what you have in common , " said hering .
" germany and poland have a common history that is full of suffering .
but it 's also important to find similarities that help you look toward the future . " readiness to forgive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bartoszewski says he 's willing to forgive poland 's former foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski knows about suffering .
he was 17 when world war ii broke out and later spent one year as a concentration camp prisoner in auschwitz .
yet he has continually been active in supporting german-polish reconciliation , both as foreign minister and now as poland 's special envoy for german relations . " one can forgive and , as a christian , one should want and be able to forgive when somebody admits their guilt , expresses regret and awaits forgiveness , " said bartoszewski . " but how can i talk about forgiveness regarding people who were n't even born during those critical times ? " he continued .
" no one bears guilt for deeds he did n't commit himself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german historical museum museum is a berlin landmark german minister of state for culture bernd neumann and poland 's culture minister bogdan zdrojewski officially opened the exhibit on wednesday .
at the event in berlin 's ephraim palace , the ministers signed a joint declaration paving the way for a european network for memory and solidarity . based in warsaw , the network is to begin its work later this year , focusing on the analysis , documentation and distribution of information about the past .
hungary and slovakia are expected to sign the declaration later in warsaw . the exhibit , entitled " germans and poles : abysses and hope , " runs in the german historical museum through sept .

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights .

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights . " business needs stability , and stability comes from respect for human rights .

if guns are accessible to anyone other than the license holder , that person will be subject to punishment .
if a judge finds that someone deliberately allowed adolescents access to firearms , that person will face a prison sentence .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tim k. , known as a reserved boy , shocked the nation in march the age of those allowed to use high-caliber firearms will also be raised from 14 to 18 .
the social democrats wanted to ban high-caliber rifles altogether , but the ministers agreed not to go that far .
the bill also tightens up penalties for those who neglect the terms of gun licenses , which are required before being allowed to possess a weapon in germany .
response to school shooting “ our aim is to make it harder for young people to get access to guns , ” said germany 's interior minister wolfgang schaeuble , in response to criticism of the amendment on wednesday .
after the school rampage in march , the government was pressured to toughen gun laws in the country to prevent further juvenile attacks .
in that attack , one of the deadliest in germany , tim k. , a 17-year-old former student at a school in winnenden in the southwest of the country , used a gun owned by his father to shoot nine of his fellow students , three teachers and three others , before killing himself .
the german government had also considered banning paintball , a real-life shooting game in which teams ambush one another with paint pellets , but the measure was dropped from the bill .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hunters in germany are disgruntled by the proposed changes one of merkel 's aides said the chancellor would invite parliament to pass a resolution calling for a prohibition of paintball at a later date , adding , however , that such a ban could be promulgated by regulation .
changes upset hunters the proposed changes have stirred public debate in germany , with many of the country 's hunters , especially , opposed .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schaeuble was under pressure to toughen gun laws after the march rampage in germany , there are over 365,000 registered hunters .
to gain the right to hunt , one must complete hunter safety schooling and a series of gun training courses .
the crime rate among hunters in the country is very low , which has caused some , like reinhard wolf , a hunter in bonn , to voice his opposition against the toughened laws .
“ to be honest , it upsets me a little bit .
among us hunters , the rate of someone using their gun to commit a crime is something like 0.0001 percent .
just because other people break the law with their guns , does n't mean that the people who actually follow the rules should have to follow even tougher laws .
i do n't think that 's how it should be , ” he said .
interior minister schaeuble has said that the changes to the gun law were made to raise the general awareness of the country 's gun owners , but hunters like reinhard wolf say this awareness , part of obligatory hunter safety courses , is already thoroughly ingrained in the hunting community. glb / dpa / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

environmentalists in the area say this is proof enough that more was going on in gorleben than the authorities admit to .
illegal construction at the time those costs were recorded , gorleben had permits only to test the feasibility of turning the site into a nuclear waste dump .
however , kersten ruedeck , who heads a german environmental organization , says that , by that time , work had already begun on the construction of a nuclear waste storage site .
“ our worst fears have come true .
in gorleben they were n't only testing , but had already started building the storage site years earlier , ” she said .

gorleben is one of two nuclear waste storage sites in germany .
shipments of waste to the site regularly spark angry protests , and those opposed to the use of nuclear energy in germany are hoping that thursday 's allegations could lead to gorleben being shut down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have called on gabriel to close down gorleben this is something , says ruedeck , that the organizations have been seeking for years .
“ the report confirms our position that gorleben must be shut down as soon as possible .
this must not be tolerated .
it 's illegal to begin construction without a permit and without official plans to do so - and then to lie to the public about it .
gorleben must be done away with , ” she said .
ruedeck and fellow environmentalists are now hoping that environment minister sigmar gabriel will take swift action to close the site down. glb / dpa / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it collated the opinions of muslims living in 14 european nations and minorities in general from the 27 eu member states .
it found that one third of the muslim respondents said they were discriminated against in the past 12 months , and 11 per cent said they had been victims of racist crime .
about 30 percent of the discrimination cases occurred when muslims were looking for work or at work , while 14 percent took place in bars , restaurants or in dealings with landlords , the report said .
" the high levels of discrimination in employment are worrying , " fra director morten kjaerum said .
" employment is a key part of the integration process . "
muslims from africa worst off the survey also found that 81 percent of those interviewed did not report discriminatory acts , largely because they believed that reporting them would not change anything .
the report called on eu governments to tackle discrimination by making people aware of how to file complaints about discrimination and racism .
the report said that muslims from africa suffered the most prejudice . muslim immigrants in malta and italy were subjected to particularly harsh discrimination , the report added .
64 percent of african muslims in malta and 55 percent in italy said they were discriminated against last year .
both italy and malta are the preferred destinations for hundreds of illegal immigrants from africa each year who arrive on the nations ' shores in rickety boats .
agency concerned about ethnic profiling the report also found that wearing traditional or religious clothing does not increase discrimination .
and most of the muslims surveyed did not consider religion as the main reason for discrimination .
only ten percent of muslims who experienced prejudice said this was solely due to their religious beliefs while over half of the respondents felt their ethnic origin was the reason for the discrimination .
the report said that ethnic profiling was on the rise in the european union .
two fifths of muslims said they had been stopped by police in 2008 on the grounds of their ethnic origin . the report concluded that authorities needed to assess ethnic profiling and find out if it " effectively increases the identification of criminal activity or alienates and discriminates against muslim communities .

" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .
a quick turn in the tide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : united 's defense were shellshocked the catalans ' powerful cameroon striker samuel eto 'o latched onto a simple ball from andres iniesta on the right side of the area , and cut inside past a surprisingly lackadaisical nemanja vidic .
a split-second before united 's michael carrick , tracking back , put in a slide tackle , eto 'o fired a low shot into the opposite corner .
an easy goal , and one united more or less served up to barcelona on a platter .
that the goal came against the run of play seemed to disappoint united , as longtime manager alex ferguson admitted after the match .
" i think the first goal was a killer for us – their first attack and they scored , " he said .
" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .
but united 's grapes could n't have been too sour going into halftime – one player 's good effort just does n't outweigh those of another ten who looked lost in the face of a footballing juggernaut .
second verse … the second half began much as the first had , with a lively united , made a bit livelier by the hard-charging striker carlos tevez .
united were crisp in attack , and had a few promising looks at the goal .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lionel messi , tackled here , would have the last laugh this time , though , barcelona was also in form from the outset , holding possession for spells while united watched the ball flit around the pitch .
united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .
" but in fairness , we were beaten by a better team . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barcelona 's fans got what they were looking for this year - three times over a place in history it 's the third time barcelona have won the champions league , having also hoisted the cup in 1992 and 2006 .
as french striker thierry henry reminded the press after the game , the catalan side also made history in spanish football .
" i have no words to describe what we have done this year , " he said .
" it ’ s not only the champions league , no team has ever has done the triple in spain and we ’ ll always remain as the first one to do it . "
barcelona ’ s three titles for the season are the champions league , the copa del rey -lrb- spanish cup -rrb- and the spanish league crown .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de unemployment -pipe- 28.05.2009 unemployment rate drops - but only slightly großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unemployment numbers usually drop significantly in the spring but not this year unemployment continues to plague the german economy , according to new official figures .
experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" underlying the economic crisis is an explosive human rights crisis .
the economic downturn has aggravated abuses , distracted attention from them and created new problems , " amnesty chief irene khan said .
" in other words : we are sitting on a powder keg of inequality , injustice and insecurity , and it is about to explode . " it was a fallacy to believe that economic recovery could be achieved while millions of new " prisoners of poverty " were being created , said khan as she presented the organization 's 2009 report on the state of human rights in 157 countries . " ignoring one crisis to focus on another us a recipe for aggravating both , " she said .
" economic recovery will be neither sustainable nor equitable if governments fail to tackle abuses that drive and deepen poverty , or armed conflicts that generate new violations . " new human rights deal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : amnesty 's 2009 report is some 400 pages long khan urged a " new global deal " on human rights , and said that the united states and china in particular had to sign up " to human rights for all . " " the united states does not accept the notion of economic , cultural and social rights while china does not respect civil and political rights , " said khan . the examples of china and russia were proof that " open markets have not led to open societies , " said khan , urging world leaders to use trade as a " leverage " to demand respect for human rights . " business needs stability , and stability comes from respect for human rights . " amnesty criticized the group of 20 nations for claiming the " mantle of world leadership " while their own records on human rights were " tarnished . " " the new leadership of the g20 is marred by old , failed approaches to human rights , " khan said . problems around the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe is taken to task for its treatment of sinti and roma in 2008 , the period covered in the report , 78 percent of all executions took place in g20 member states , with the united states , china and saudi arabia accounting for the highest number of executions , the report shows . in europe , amnesty highlights problems ranging from the use of cluster munitions during the brief georgia-russia war , to widespread discrimination against ethnic minorities . " migrants , roma , jews and muslims were among those subjected to hate crimes by individuals or extremist groups , " amnesty 's report says . but the human rights group 's report is n't all gloomy .
amnesty says states could deal with the wreckage of the economic crisis by rebuilding in a socially aware manner . " the state has been retreating or reneging on its human rights obligations in favor of the market in the belief that economic growth would lift all boats , " khan said .
" with the tide receding and boats springing leaks , governments are radically changing their positions and talking about a new global financial architecture and international governance system in which the state plays a stronger role ... than the one that has characterized international policy-making for the past 20 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.05.2009 relegation playoff revives an exciting bit of the bundesliga ’ s past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus have the chanc e to stay up despite a poor season for the first time in nearly two decades the third-worst team from the first division will play the third-best from the second for a spot in the top flight .
history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .

how can the german government pay off its massive state debt ?
the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says the answer is to raise vat to 25 percent from 2011 . the german institute for economic research -lrb- diw -rrb- says that the german government can fill its gaping budget hole by increasing value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 19 to 25 percent from 2011 .
“ by announcing a vat increase now , people would start buying goods today , knowing they would cost six percent more in the future , " klaus zimmermann , the president of diw , told the regional daily , rheinische post . “ there is no other way the government can balance its books . ”
zimmermann added , pointing out that scandinavians already pay 25 percent vat .
due to the financial and economic crisis and numerous stimulus measures that have been agreed , the german cabinet on wednesday revised its budget deficit forecast for 2009 and said its new debt would increase from an earlier estimate of 10.7 billion euros to a record 47.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 66.2 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reiner holznagel says the diw 's idea does n't deserve to be taken seriously not everyone agrees that raising vat is the answer reiner holznagel , the ceo of the federation of german taxpayers has slammed zimmermann 's suggestion .
“ the government last raised vat in 2005 , just after the current grand coalition was formed , ” he said .
at that time berlin increased vat from 16 to 19 percent .
“ the government then also said it needed to raise vat to balance its budget .
we now know that they never balanced the books , they simply went on spending more , ” holznagel said .
holznagel also rejected the reference to scandinavian nations .
“ that 's like comparing apples with pears .
a large part of vat revenue collected in scandinavian countries is used to fund social security benefits .
you ca n't compare this to the way the german system is set up , ” he said .
“ it 's time -lrb- berlin -rrb- started thinking about lowering taxes instead , ” said holznagel .
“ the government does n't have an income problem , they have a problem with the way they spend taxpayers ' money . "

both had played attractive attacking football all year , and won their respective leagues with points to spare .
but only one of the two titans brought their good form into this game : barca .
as the game began , united actually was the fresher side , as the english champs came out swinging .
in the very first minute , cristiano ronaldo whipped in a free kick from 25 meters out that almost beat barcelona keeper victor valdes , and barcelona did well to clear before park ji-sung could pounce on the rebound .
ronaldo went close in the eighth minute as well , volleying just wide , and when the first goal came in a minute later the biggest surprise was that it was barca 's .

" we 'd started bravely too , very confident .
we got a little bit nervous after that . "
united lost possession right after the re-start , giving up a corner , and slowly but surely ceded control of the match to barcelona .
by the twentieth minute , barcelona was playing its familiar possession game , often stringing together 10 , 12 , even 15 passes on the trot .
one-man show falls short cristiano ronaldo was just about the only united player pushing the tempo , going on a number of solo runs that barcelona 's defense could only stop with by a good solid hip-check as he pushed past , following the ball .
one such foul , from gerard pique , set up a free kick but did n't draw a yellow card ; another , from yaya toure , was not called at all .

united midfielder ryan giggs said the team was encouraged that it was creating chances , but was ultimately overwhelmed .
" barcelona can make you look silly , and at times we maybe chased it and did n't keep our shape as well as we could have , " said giggs .
" still , we probably created more chances than barcelona . "
but those chances did n't amount to goals .
after united brought on two more attacking players in dimitar berbatov and paul scholes , it was really only a matter of time before united 's ambition to level the score was punished at the back .
sealing the deal in the 70th minute , barcelona 's midfielder xavi spotted lionel messi nearly alone making a run into the box .
he sent in a looping cross that the argentine striker sent skillfully in the opposite direction – catching united keeper edwin van der saar off balance so badly that all he could do was wave as it sailed by .
the moment was emblematic of the night – pretty , precise , and effective play from barcelona , and a united side who seemed to recognize that they were beaten .
" we had some half-chances in the second half , and we should have done better with our crosses , " said alex ferguson .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

"
africa has scored particularly poorly , and ai says that reality and rhetoric there differ vastly . erwin van der borght , the africa program director for amnesty international in london , spoke to deutsche welle about the conclusions reached in this year 's report .
van der borght : what we wanted to highlight is the situation of people living in poverty in africa , and we are also particularly concerned that they will increasingly be affected by the current economic crisis .
we know that there is a clear link between people living in poverty and human rights violations , those people are much more vulnerable .
and we already saw that , for example in 2008 when there was the food crisis , and the increase in price of basic commodities , which led to hundreds of thousands of people demonstrating in various towns and countries in africa .
they were demonstrating because their lives , their access to food was at risk .
we also saw a very repressive reaction from many governments , for example in cameroon more than 100 people were killed during those demonstrations in 2008 .
it 's true that some of those demonstrations turned violent , but we really feel that the use of force by the authorities and police in cameroon and other countries was excessive .
we also have other examples , like in burkina faso where hundreds of people were arrested and sentenced to prison terms after unfair trials .
we saw also in guinea demonstrations against shortages of water and electricity , over living conditions .
there , too , we saw examples of the excessive use of force and protesters being killed .
so we are very concerned that the current economic crisis will reinforce that trend , and that those who are most vulnerable , those who are living on the margin , will be very severely affected .
dw : two countries that you did n't mention are zimbabwe and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have been driven from their homes in african conflicts van der borght : certainly we saw also the political crisis in zimbabwe erupting around the elections last year , and again there was repression .
hundreds of activists , political opponents and even journalists were arrested arbitrarily , just for expressing their opinion .
people were killed , either by government officials , or people working on behalf of the government .
even now that there is an inclusive government , there is no accountability , the people responsible for those violations have not been held to account .
of course , we also remain concerned about the situation of armed conflict in sudan , and particularly darfur , but also somalia and the democratic republic of congo - where the conflict has flared up again .
and all the parties involved in those conflict situations are responsible for gross human rights violations , including killings of civilians , sexual violence against women , and the recruitment of child soldiers .
one of the problems which also contributes to those human rights violations is the spread of small arms to those countries , even though there are un arms embargoes against those countries , it 's clear that not enough is being done to stop those transfers of weapons .
we see , for example in somalia , that enormous resources are being deployed to tackle the piracy issue , which is acceptable , but we do n't see the same efforts and resources being mobilized to address the conflict , to address the violations of humanitarian law , and also to stop the transfers of arms to those conflict zones .
dw : in light of the global economic crisis , and the fact that it affects people in the poorest countries most , what can be done ?
can the world bank or the international monetary fund offer any aid ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : africa is the continent most in need of stimulus packages van der borght : well , it certainly is important that international financial institutions - but also governments worldwide - take the human rights dimensions into account when addressing this crisis .
it 's important that development assistance continues , it 's also important that governments in those developing countries , including african ones , make the right choices .
that they continue to invest in providing social services to their people to ensure the right to health , water , sanitation , food and adequate housing ; they also have to address the issue of corruption , which is a major obstacle to providing those services ; they have to continue to seek international assistance ; and they also have to be accountable to their people .
dw : what specifically would amnesty international say should be done immediately ?
van der borght : first of all , governments in africa should be accountable to their people .
they should listen and they should continue to invest in social services .
it 's also important that those responsible for human rights violations come under investigation and are prosecuted , because otherwise this cycle of human rights abuses will continue .
we see that law enforcement agencies , or police , who are responsible for human rights abuses are hardly ever being investigated and prosecuted .
we see that , for example , the international justice system - specifically the international criminal court - are playing a certain role , but they only have a limited capacity and are only able to prosecute a few people .
but even there , we see that governments in africa are pledging misplaced solidarity to their fellow leaders .
instead of being accountable to their people , they shield their colleagues from international prosecution , even those who are responsible for war crimes and crimes against humanity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 28.05.2009 relegation playoff revives an exciting bit of the bundesliga ’ s past großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cottbus have the chanc e to stay up despite a poor season for the first time in nearly two decades the third-worst team from the first division will play the third-best from the second for a spot in the top flight .
history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

environmentalists in the area say this is proof enough that more was going on in gorleben than the authorities admit to .
illegal construction at the time those costs were recorded , gorleben had permits only to test the feasibility of turning the site into a nuclear waste dump .
however , kersten ruedeck , who heads a german environmental organization , says that , by that time , work had already begun on the construction of a nuclear waste storage site .
“ our worst fears have come true .
in gorleben they were n't only testing , but had already started building the storage site years earlier , ” she said .

gorleben is one of two nuclear waste storage sites in germany .
shipments of waste to the site regularly spark angry protests , and those opposed to the use of nuclear energy in germany are hoping that thursday 's allegations could lead to gorleben being shut down .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : activists have called on gabriel to close down gorleben this is something , says ruedeck , that the organizations have been seeking for years .
“ the report confirms our position that gorleben must be shut down as soon as possible .
this must not be tolerated .
it 's illegal to begin construction without a permit and without official plans to do so - and then to lie to the public about it .
gorleben must be done away with , ” she said .
ruedeck and fellow environmentalists are now hoping that environment minister sigmar gabriel will take swift action to close the site down. glb / dpa / epd editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

burma denies that the trial of aung suu kyi is politically motivated . speaking at the summit in phnom penh on thursday , burma 's deputy foreign minister maung myint told his counterparts from southeast asia and europe that the trial of pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi was an " internal legal " issue .
" it 's not political .
it 's not a human rights issue , so we do n't accept the pressure and interference from abroad , " maung myint said in the strongest reaction by burma so far to international outrage at the trial of suu kyi .
his comments came as ministers of the association of southeast asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- and the european union , who were meeting in cambodia , urged burma to free all political prisoners including suu kyi .
" we are still deeply concerned about mrs suu kyi 's detention , " said czech foreign minister jan kohout , whose country holds the rotating eu presidency .
" she should be released immediately and the burmese government must enter dialogue with all political parties , " he added .
at the end of their meetings , the eu and asean issued a joint statement calling on burma to grant early release to all political prisoners and lift restrictions on political parties .
critics denounce suu kyi trial suu kyi is being tried at a prison in rangoon on charges that she violated the terms of her house arrest after an american man swam to her lakeside house in early may .
the nobel peace prize winner has denied the charges , saying that she only offered temporary shelter to the man .
the trial has been adjourned to monday . the court only allowed testimony from lawyer kyi win to be heard .
he is suu kyi 's only defense witness after the judge rejected three others without giving a reason .
if convicted , suu kyi faces five years in prison .
critics have denounced the process as a show trial aimed at keeping the democracy icon in detention during an election next year that is expected to increase the generals ' hold on power .
even though the trial of aung san suu kyi dominated the meetings , the eu and european commission did manage to sign a cooperation treaty with asean nations .
jan kohout described the treaty as a " road map " with the two sides agreeing to cooperate on issues ranging from the global financial crisis and human trafficking to climate change. sp / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those policies were once associated with socialists .
so why are left-of-center parties not sweeping elections ? the latest opinion polls ahead of the upcoming elections for the european parliament paint a familiar picture .
the european conservatives are expected to remain the strongest bloc in the assembly with the socialists again being relegated to second place , a position they have held since 1994 .
it does n't look much better for socialist parties at the national level either .
currently they lead governments in only eight out of 27 countries and the prospects for a reversal of that trend are not good .
according to recent surveys , they face an uphill struggle in many upcoming elections , some of them in large european countries such as britain and germany .
still , says peter mair , chairman of the political science department at the european university institute in florence , to state that socialists are n't benefitting from the economic crisis at all is incorrect .
in some countries their showing has actually improved due to the global recession .
" in the dutch case , for example , the dutch labor party was really in a trough before this crisis broke , but now it 's riding not high in the opinion polls , but it 's certainly riding better in the opinion polls .
in the irish case , a small country to be sure , the labor party is polling better than it 's ever polled in its history before . " even in the european parliamentary elections the social democrats might still eke out small gains , adds mair .
neoliberal agenda but the question remains why are socialists , in the midst of the worst financial crisis in decades , which has propelled states to become major economic actors , not scoring huge election victories instead of struggling to gain a few percentage points here and there ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialists are rediscovering john maynard keynes -lrb- left -rrb- " i would say that for the social democrats , for the moderate left , there is a return of ideas of a strong and interventionist state , which tries to have an influence on economic development and that 's the old social democratic idea about keynesian intervention " , says klaus detterbeck , an expert on political parties in europe at the university of magdeburg .
" the problem is that the social democrats themselves are not particularly convinced that these are the right measures for periods which are not characterized by crisis . "
these measures - the nationalization of banks and other important economic entities , tight regulation of financial markets and instruments , wage and benefits limits for top managers - were advocated by the left .
but that was back in the 1950 's , the 1960s and the 1970 's .
from the 1980 's onwards , argues mair , the left moved away from its strong interventionist approach .
" in the last 20 years the socialists have not really talked about things like this " , says mair .
" the left embraced the neoliberal agenda and the hands-off agenda .
so , when the ground shifts , they ca n't say we were right all along because they told us before that these policies were wrong . "
solutions instead of ideology therefore the socialists have lost much of their advantage on those issues and are pretty much in the same position as the conservatives .
both have to adapt to the new economic circumstances and change their strategies .
and this is one reason why it is so hard for socialists to reap substantial profit from the crisis and win elections , explains mair .
" partly because in all of the answers to the crisis there tends to be a consensus between center-left and center-right as to what might be done and the arguments are at the margins rather than at the core of the policies . "
people expect practical solutions instead of ideological arguments .
the party affiliation of politicians or the role of the party itself becomes secondary .
" at the moment i would say that most voters will look whether the recipes of their national government will work and they will give credit to any government party which is able to save jobs and make the economy work again " , says detterbeck .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationalization is no longer just a socialist idea while this is a grim short-term perspective for european socialists who currently run only eight of 27 governments , there is light at the end of the tunnel .
" there is nothing structural which is driving the socialists or the center-left out of power " , says mair .
" if you look at the long history of post-war electoral developments in europe , it 's really like a pendulum . "
right now it 's the conservatives ' turn , but the socialists will be on top again within 10 years , predicts mair .
all that is required in the meantime is some patience . author : michael knigge editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

history predicts a tight contest . derided by many as a gimmick intended to squeeze a last few euros from fans , the relegation playoff was in fact once a fixture in the bundesliga calendar .
so when cottbus meet nuremberg for a home-and-away tie this thursday and sunday , they 'll be following in a tradition with no shortage of curiosities .
the bundesliga introduced the relegation playoff with the creation of the unified second division in 1981-82 – before then there were a number of competing regional leagues .
the first ever such tie featured bayer leverkusen against kickers offenbach and showed how influential the results could be to the further development of the clubs concerned .
leverkusen stayed in the first division thanks to a 3-1 win on aggregate and established themselves as one of the bundesliga 's top clubs .
offenbach , who had twice been the second-best team in germany , never again came within sniffing distance of the top flight and are currently languishing in division three .
schalke 's dark hour bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fortuna cologne , featuring dieter schatzscheider , right , came up short against dortmund first division sides generally dominated the playoffs , but there were some upsets .
the biggest came in 1982-83 when bayer uerdingen -lrb- currently in the fifth division -rrb- toppled schalke 4-2 .
even mentioning the year 1983 remains a serious taboo in gelsenkirchen .
1986 saw the wildest playoff .
heavily favored dortmund lost its opening match 2-0 to second-division fortuna cologne and struggled to equalize on aggregate in the return game .
the tie went to an all-deciding third match , and dortmund clearly decided enough was enough .
they thrashed fortuna 8-0 – the most lopsided scoreline in relegation history .
cottbus and nuremberg will be spared that sort of scenario , but they could be faced with football 's ultimate test of nerves .
if the aggregate score is tied , the away-goals rule applies , and if neither team has an advantage in that category , there will be a penalty shoot-out .
east versus west bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuremberg in red have the chance to regain elite status while rostock remain mired in division two it 's slightly ironic that cottbus – the only remaining eastern german club in the first division – should be involved in the revival of the relegation playoff since it was the reunification of germany that killed off this peculiar bundesliga institution in the first place .
for the 1991-92 season , the first division was expanded to 20 teams in order to incorporate two teams from the former east germany , hansa rostock and dynamo dresden .
to get back down to the customary 18 , four teams were relegated that year , rendering a playoff senseless .
in the intervening 17 years , eastern german clubs have found life very difficult – with cottbus and rostock bobbing up and down between divisions one and two , and dresden descending into financial chaos and , ultimately , the third division .
so cottbus will be playing for the footballing pride of an entire region – and they 'll be thankful that the german football league , the dfl , decided to remove the playoff from the mothballs .
under last season 's rules , sixteenth-placed cottbus would have been automatically relegated , and eastern germany would once again have been without a team in the country 's elite league .

experts say a reduced hours program funded by the government has saved jobs but ca n't continue to prop up the labor market alone . as the global economy continues to hemorrhage , unemployment in germany dropped slightly to 8.2 percent in may from 8.6 percent the previous month , according to new figures from the federal labor agency . this represents an increase in the number of unemployed by just 1000 on a seasonally adjusted basis .
typically unemployment drops in may as the weather improves and seasonal work , including construction , picks up .
so , the virtual standstill this may is hardly good news in comparison to recent years .
in may 2008 , the ranks of the registered unemployed shrank by 180,000 .
the new figures come amidst germany 's worst recession since world war ii .
this month 's figures were distorted by a new rule requiring the agency not to count as unemployed those people who are being re-trained within a company .
" as the severity of the recession has become clear , government incentives to maintain headcounts and cut hours have become increasingly ineffective , " warned jennifer mckeown , a capital economics economist .
german measures against crisis losing steam the federal labor agency also documented the soaring numbers of those placed on so-called kurzarbeit .
these workers receive take-home pay comprising two elements : their employer pays only for the hours they actually work , while the agency pays a subsidy on top .
in the case of a worker with family the agency provides for 67 percent of the net salary shortfall .
for singles its top-up is 60 percent of the net shortfall .
the labor agency reported 452,000 new registrations of workers on reduced hours in april , 679,000 in march and 721,00 in february .
it estimates that at least another 270,000 joined in may .
the most recent data indicates that in march 1.2 million workers received salary subsidies from the government to make up for their reduced hours .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no orders means empty desks .
reduced hours have helped some companies avoid layoffs german experts think this reduced hours program has thus far blunted the impact to the workforce of the economic crisis and continues to slow the shedding of jobs .
but heinrich alt , a member of the labor agency 's board of directors , is worried that the program wo n't be enough to maintain job security in the long run .
" as the crisis continues and the number of unemployed increases as expected , we will have to consider broadening our approach with other tools , " alt told the berliner zeitung , a berlin daily .
if companies are no longer able to afford even the reduced hour workers , they will have to consider layoffs , alt said .
in that case , transitional companies , where employees continued to be paid while they are re-trained or seek out new employment , would be the best way to buffer the layoffs .
young workers without job training who find themselves unemployed should be given apprenticeships or be given a second chance to enter vocational training , alt added. hf / afp / ap / reuters editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 1939 .
nearly 70 years later , a new exhibit in berlin 's german historical museum focuses on the rocky history of german-polish ties . around 750 photographs , documents , works of art and other historical items - many from personal collections - go on display in berlin on thursday , may 28 . organized in memory of the beginning of the nazi plan of eastward expansion , the exhibit highlights their 1939 invasion via gdansk as well as the brutal nazi occupation of poland through 1945 . the exhibit begins by examining ties between the neighbors in the 18th century , when present-day poland was partitioned between russia , prussia and austria , and continues to after world war ii , looking at the expulsion of germans from poland after 1945 , cold war relations and recent reconciliation efforts . different takes on history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a polish woman mourns for her sister , who was shot as nazi soldiers entered poland in 1939 the way history is viewed and taught in both countries has differed dramatically - but is also a key factor in encouraging reconciliation . " the poles concentrate on the battles that took place in poland during world war ii , on the fight within poland against hitler 's germany and on the other theaters of war , " historian michael mueller told deutsche welle .
" and of course they 're concerned with the suffering of the polish people . " when they think of war crimes , the germans are mainly concerned with the crimes of the soviet union , but of course also with the holocaust and their own suffering , " he added . mueller has led a joint german-polish school text book committee for the past 10 years .
he said polish school books always contained a lot of information about germany , even if it was n't always correct .
the bigger problem , however , was that poland was often not even mentioned at all in german text books . to correct that , mueller 's committee has made recommendations on what should be included in school books in both countries and prepared materials for teachers to use in class . similarities waiting to be discovered bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many programs connect german and polish youth another effective approach to reconciliation has been exchange programs that allow germans to visit poland and vice versa . johannes hering , a 20-year-old from germany , said he 's enthusiastic about getting to know poland and also about helping other germans appreciate their neighbor to the east . he has spent time in poland caring for a few of the 18,000 holocaust survivors , now in their 80s , who live in the country , and is considering returning to poland to study . " you have to work on finding out what you have in common , " said hering .
" germany and poland have a common history that is full of suffering .
but it 's also important to find similarities that help you look toward the future . " readiness to forgive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bartoszewski says he 's willing to forgive poland 's former foreign minister wladyslaw bartoszewski knows about suffering .
he was 17 when world war ii broke out and later spent one year as a concentration camp prisoner in auschwitz .
yet he has continually been active in supporting german-polish reconciliation , both as foreign minister and now as poland 's special envoy for german relations . " one can forgive and , as a christian , one should want and be able to forgive when somebody admits their guilt , expresses regret and awaits forgiveness , " said bartoszewski . " but how can i talk about forgiveness regarding people who were n't even born during those critical times ? " he continued .
" no one bears guilt for deeds he did n't commit himself . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german historical museum museum is a berlin landmark german minister of state for culture bernd neumann and poland 's culture minister bogdan zdrojewski officially opened the exhibit on wednesday .
at the event in berlin 's ephraim palace , the ministers signed a joint declaration paving the way for a european network for memory and solidarity . based in warsaw , the network is to begin its work later this year , focusing on the analysis , documentation and distribution of information about the past .
hungary and slovakia are expected to sign the declaration later in warsaw . the exhibit , entitled " germans and poles : abysses and hope , " runs in the german historical museum through sept .

but opposition parties and political observers suspect the communist party was looking to gain time and secure the one last vote they need to elect their candidate , prime minister zinaida greceanii .
the proposal came from outgoing communist president vladimir voronin , who is reported to be planning to stay on the political scene after being forced out by the term limits , by becoming the speaker of parliament .
deputies then approved the motion .
" we took a break in order to have another chance for consultations with the opposition and try to elect a president , " voronin told journalists after the session was adjourned .
voronin is keen to avoid another stalemate because if a second vote fails , the country must hold new parliamentary elections .
moldova is a former soviet state and europe 's poorest country .
after the parliamentary elections in april , the opposition said the vote was rigged and stormed government buildings in protest .
" we are ready for negotiations but one of the conditions is that voronin quit all his posts , " said serafim urechean , head of the our moldova party .

she said mr moore - a computer expert captured with his four security guards whilst working in iraq 's finance ministry in may 2007 - seemed in a much better state .
" he looked a lot , lot healthier , a lot better than the first video which was very distressing , " she said . "
jason 's not one to take his own life , no way " marie , mother of jason " all the way through the video he spoke in the plural , " said mrs sweeney , of the most recent footage released by his captors in march as a " goodwill " gesture to the uk government .
" all the videos have been in the singular in the past , which made us think that probably they are all together now .
" -lsb- that -rsb- is wonderful as far as i 'm concerned because they 'll all be there bullying each other along . "
this is a key detail , because last year it was announced that one of the hostages , known only as jason , had committed suicide .
his mother marie refuses to believe this .
" jason is a very strong guy , " she said .
" so when we got the news that he had taken his own life we just did n't believe it .
" jason 's not that sort of guy , he 's very strong , very wilful , very outspoken and he 's not one to take his own life , no way . "
the families have been told that the atmosphere in iraq is much more conducive now to a peaceful resolution .
constant ordeal but for them , every day remains an ordeal .
jan , a friend of another captive , also called jason , said his seven-year-old daughter maddi had written her missing father a letter .
" she sent me this last night , she asked if i could get a message to her dad . "
" to daddy - i miss you very much " read maddi 's letter in full it reads : " to daddy , i miss you very much , we all want you to come home .
i love you very much ...
" when you come back i will give you the biggest huge hug .
" we will never give up until you come home .
i love you and miss you so much .
lots of kisses , maddi . "
but insights like this into the lives of the hostage families are rare .
for most of the time there has been a media blackout on this story .
roseleen , the wife of a hostage called alan , said both the families and the foreign office had decided it should apply .
" initially it was the foreign office advice but we followed that and i think as families i think we are all happy with the limited coverage that there is at the moment , " she said .
" we believe it is in the best interests of our loved ones " .
the media blackout , added mrs sweeney , originally came from the insurgents who said they did not want publicity .
but in december 2007 they broke their silence with a video showing a hostage flanked by gunmen and threatening to kill him .
since then there have been on-off negotiations conducted through intermediaries .
confusing world the foreign office says britain has a longstanding and proven policy of never making substantial concessions to kidnappers .
however , in the confusing world of iraqi tribal politics and power broking there are many who would like to see this crisis brought to a peaceful end .
the prospects for the men 's release , many believe , are better now than they were a year ago and have just been put back by the recent upsurge in general violence .
but the iraq of today , says uk foreign secretary david milliband , is a different place to that of two years ago .
" there are signs of progress and reconciliation as the iraqi people show their commitment to a democratic and peaceful future , " he said .
" hostage-taking has no part in that future .
" we call on those holding all hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and return them safely to their families where they belong . "
for the families of the five britons now preparing to begin their third year in captivity , the hope is that the men will somehow get to hear that their plight is not forgotten , that their families are waiting for the day they come home and that life for their loved ones can resume .

advertisement families of the kidnapped men speak of their ordeal by frank gardner security correspondent , bbc news when pauline sweeney saw new video footage featuring her stepson peter moore , it gave her fresh hope .
she said mr moore - a computer expert captured with his four security guards whilst working in iraq 's finance ministry in may 2007 - seemed in a much better state .
" he looked a lot , lot healthier , a lot better than the first video which was very distressing , " she said .
jason 's not one to take his own life , no way marie , mother of jason " all the way through the video he spoke in the plural , " said mrs sweeney , of the most recent footage released by his captors in march as a " goodwill " gesture to the uk government .
" all the videos have been in the singular in the past , which made us think that probably they are all together now .
" -lsb- that -rsb- is wonderful as far as i 'm concerned because they 'll all be there bullying each other along . "
this is a key detail , because last year it was announced that one of the hostages , known only as jason , had committed suicide .
his mother marie refuses to believe this .
" jason is a very strong guy , " she said .
" so when we got the news that he had taken his own life we just did n't believe it .
" jason 's not that sort of guy , he 's very strong , very wilful , very outspoken and he 's not one to take his own life , no way . "
the families have been told that the atmosphere in iraq is much more conducive now to a peaceful resolution .
constant ordeal but for them , every day remains an ordeal .
jan , a friend of another captive , also called jason , said his seven-year-old daughter maddi had written her missing father a letter .
" she sent me this last night , she asked if i could get a message to her dad . "
to daddy - i miss you very much read maddi 's letter in full it reads : " to daddy , i miss you very much , we all want you to come home .
i love you very much ...
" when you come back i will give you the biggest huge hug .
" we will never give up until you come home .
i love you and miss you so much .
lots of kisses , maddi . "
but insights like this into the lives of the hostage families are rare .
for most of the time there has been a media blackout on this story .
roseleen , the wife of a hostage called alan , said both the families and the foreign office had decided it should apply .
" initially it was the foreign office advice but we followed that and i think as families i think we are all happy with the limited coverage that there is at the moment , " she said .
" we believe it is in the best interests of our loved ones " .
the media blackout , added mrs sweeney , originally came from the insurgents who said they did not want publicity .
but in december 2007 they broke their silence with a video showing a hostage flanked by gunmen and threatening to kill him .
since then there have been on-off negotiations conducted through intermediaries .
confusing world the foreign office says britain has a longstanding and proven policy of never making substantial concessions to kidnappers .
however , in the confusing world of iraqi tribal politics and power broking there are many who would like to see this crisis brought to a peaceful end .
the prospects for the men 's release , many believe , are better now than they were a year ago and have just been put back by the recent upsurge in general violence .
but the iraq of today , says uk foreign secretary david milliband , is a different place to that of two years ago .
" there are signs of progress and reconciliation as the iraqi people show their commitment to a democratic and peaceful future , " he said .
" hostage-taking has no part in that future .
" we call on those holding all hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and return them safely to their families where they belong . "
for the families of the five britons now preparing to begin their third year in captivity , the hope is that the men will somehow get to hear that their plight is not forgotten , that their families are waiting for the day they come home and that life for their loved ones can resume .

advertisement families of the kidnapped men speak of their ordeal by frank gardner security correspondent , bbc news when pauline sweeney saw new video footage featuring her stepson peter moore , it gave her fresh hope .
she said mr moore - a computer expert captured with his four security guards whilst working in iraq 's finance ministry in may 2007 - seemed in a much better state .
" he looked a lot , lot healthier , a lot better than the first video which was very distressing , " she said .
jason 's not one to take his own life , no way marie , mother of jason " all the way through the video he spoke in the plural , " said mrs sweeney , of the most recent footage released by his captors in march as a " goodwill " gesture to the uk government .
" all the videos have been in the singular in the past , which made us think that probably they are all together now .
" -lsb- that -rsb- is wonderful as far as i 'm concerned because they 'll all be there bullying each other along . "
this is a key detail , because last year it was announced that one of the hostages , known only as jason , had committed suicide .
his mother marie refuses to believe this .
" jason is a very strong guy , " she said .
" so when we got the news that he had taken his own life we just did n't believe it .
" jason 's not that sort of guy , he 's very strong , very wilful , very outspoken and he 's not one to take his own life , no way . "
the families have been told that the atmosphere in iraq is much more conducive now to a peaceful resolution .
constant ordeal but for them , every day remains an ordeal .
jan , a friend of another captive , also called jason , said his seven-year-old daughter maddi had written her missing father a letter .
" she sent me this last night , she asked if i could get a message to her dad . "
to daddy - i miss you very much read maddi 's letter in full it reads : " to daddy , i miss you very much , we all want you to come home .
i love you very much ...
" when you come back i will give you the biggest huge hug .
" we will never give up until you come home .
i love you and miss you so much .
lots of kisses , maddi . "
but insights like this into the lives of the hostage families are rare .
for most of the time there has been a media blackout on this story .
roseleen , the wife of a hostage called alan , said both the families and the foreign office had decided it should apply .
" initially it was the foreign office advice but we followed that and i think as families i think we are all happy with the limited coverage that there is at the moment , " she said .
" we believe it is in the best interests of our loved ones " .
the media blackout , added mrs sweeney , originally came from the insurgents who said they did not want publicity .
but in december 2007 they broke their silence with a video showing a hostage flanked by gunmen and threatening to kill him .
since then there have been on-off negotiations conducted through intermediaries .
confusing world the foreign office says britain has a longstanding and proven policy of never making substantial concessions to kidnappers .
however , in the confusing world of iraqi tribal politics and power broking there are many who would like to see this crisis brought to a peaceful end .
the prospects for the men 's release , many believe , are better now than they were a year ago and have just been put back by the recent upsurge in general violence .
but the iraq of today , says uk foreign secretary david milliband , is a different place to that of two years ago .
" there are signs of progress and reconciliation as the iraqi people show their commitment to a democratic and peaceful future , " he said .
" hostage-taking has no part in that future .
" we call on those holding all hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and return them safely to their families where they belong . "
for the families of the five britons now preparing to begin their third year in captivity , the hope is that the men will somehow get to hear that their plight is not forgotten , that their families are waiting for the day they come home and that life for their loved ones can resume .

roseleen , the wife of a hostage called alan , said both the families and the foreign office had decided it should apply .

the media blackout , added mrs sweeney , originally came from the insurgents who said they did not want publicity .

however , in the confusing world of iraqi tribal politics and power broking there are many who would like to see this crisis brought to a peaceful end .
the prospects for the men 's release , many believe , are better now than they were a year ago and have just been put back by the recent upsurge in general violence .
but the iraq of today , says uk foreign secretary david milliband , is a different place to that of two years ago .
" there are signs of progress and reconciliation as the iraqi people show their commitment to a democratic and peaceful future , " he said .
" hostage-taking has no part in that future .
" we call on those holding all hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and return them safely to their families where they belong . "
for the families of the five britons now preparing to begin their third year in captivity , the hope is that the men will somehow get to hear that their plight is not forgotten , that their families are waiting for the day they come home and that life for their loved ones can resume .

advertisement families of the kidnapped men speak of their ordeal by frank gardner security correspondent , bbc news when pauline sweeney saw new video footage featuring her stepson peter moore , it gave her fresh hope .
she said mr moore - a computer expert captured with his four security guards whilst working in iraq 's finance ministry in may 2007 - seemed in a much better state .
" he looked a lot , lot healthier , a lot better than the first video which was very distressing , " she said .
jason 's not one to take his own life , no way marie , mother of jason " all the way through the video he spoke in the plural , " said mrs sweeney , of the most recent footage released by his captors in march as a " goodwill " gesture to the uk government .
" all the videos have been in the singular in the past , which made us think that probably they are all together now .
" -lsb- that -rsb- is wonderful as far as i 'm concerned because they 'll all be there bullying each other along . "
this is a key detail , because last year it was announced that one of the hostages , known only as jason , had committed suicide .
his mother marie refuses to believe this .
" jason is a very strong guy , " she said .
" so when we got the news that he had taken his own life we just did n't believe it .
" jason 's not that sort of guy , he 's very strong , very wilful , very outspoken and he 's not one to take his own life , no way . "
the families have been told that the atmosphere in iraq is much more conducive now to a peaceful resolution .
constant ordeal but for them , every day remains an ordeal .
jan , a friend of another captive , also called jason , said his seven-year-old daughter maddi had written her missing father a letter .
" she sent me this last night , she asked if i could get a message to her dad . "
to daddy - i miss you very much read maddi 's letter in full it reads : " to daddy , i miss you very much , we all want you to come home .

major phil packer , 36 , was seriously injured in a rocket attack in iraq in february last year .
but despite losing the use of his legs , he has completed a series of challenges , including walking the london marathon .
he raised the money for the forces ' charity help for heroes .
maj packer , who lives in westminster , london , now has one final fundraising mountain to climb before he concentrates his efforts on promoting opportunities for disabled people .
on 9 june , he will start a three-day attempt to pull himself 1,800ft up the sheer rock face of el capitan in yosemite national park in the us - the equivalent of 4,254 pull-ups .
maj packer , of the royal military police , rowed across the channel in february , almost a year to the day after he was wounded in basra , southern iraq . "
doing these things pushes you forward .
i got through because i did n't want to let anyone down " major phil packer this month he crossed the finishing line of the london marathon a fortnight after it began , having walked two miles a day on crutches .
help for heroes was set up in october 2007 to galvanise public support for british troops injured in the conflicts in iraq and afghanistan .
the initial aim was to raise enough money to build a gym and full-size swimming pool at the military 's main rehabilitation centre , headley court in surrey .
but the huge response to the appeal - which raised £ 17m in its first 17 months - means the charity is now able to fund a series of other projects .
maj packer said : " everyone has dark days .
for me , i 've had to move on .
" i lost control of my life overnight .
it 's very difficult when people want to do things for you or there are certain things you ca n't do .
" doing these things pushes you forward .
