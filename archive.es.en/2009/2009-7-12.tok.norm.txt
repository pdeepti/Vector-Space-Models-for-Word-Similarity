the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2009 green good intentions cause chaos in two german towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geothermal drilling was in staufen 's historic town center residents near dortmund were evacuated this week after the ground collapsed around a geothermal heat pump , while in another german town , almost 190 buildings have now been damaged by a geothermal project gone awry . residents of the small town of kamen , near dortmund , had a shock this week when ground around a construction site collapsed as a result of drilling for a geothermal heat pump .
many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

it 's the first formula one win for the 32-year-old . red bull 's mark webber has won the german grand prix from pole position at the nuerburgring circuit .
this is the first formula one win for the australian . germany 's sebastian vettel , also racing for red bull , finished second and brazilian felipe massa driving for ferrari was third .
jenson button , who leads the formula one standings , finished fifth . 32-year-old webber , in his 130th f1 race after eight years in the sport , came home 9.3 seconds clear of vettel as he raced to a victory that threw the fight for the world championship wide open . overcome by emotion after crossing the finish line , the australian said his victory was " incredible . "
it was the first victory for an australian since alan jones won in las vegas in 1981 . " it 's an incredible day for me , " said webber .
" i wanted to win so badly after silverstone .
i thought i had a good chance there . " " after pole i knew i was in a good position to win the race , i thought the only thing that could beat me or test me even more was the rain , but that held off . " early problems webber overcame a drive-through penalty after a first-lap contact with brawn 's rubens barrichello but the australian 's car turned out to be the superior one in the race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull driver sebastian vettel steers his car at the nuerburgring racetrack " i lost rubens off the start , i thought he had gone to the left , but he went right and i banged into him .
i had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm , " he said . it has been a difficult season for webber , who fractured his leg in a bicycle accident in january but recovered quickly enough to be ready at the start of the season . barrichello took an early lead but faded eventually to sixth .
the poor finish promped an angry outburst at his team . " it was a good show from the team on how to lose a race today , " he said .
" i 'm terribly upset with the way things went .
i did all i had to do .
i went first on the first corner and then they made me lose the race . " vettel , 22 , and also on the red bull team , was slightly more gracious . " congratulations to him , " he said referring to webber .
" today he was unbeatable so he totally deserved to win .
another one-two finish for the team - that 's so good . " webber is now third in the title race with 45.5 points behind leader briton jenson button on 68 points and vettel on 47 . the next race is the hungarian grand prix on july 26 . jam / td / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

the suspect arrested by police on saturday , is likely to bring to an end a series of shoe robberies which began in 2008 .
nine victims the 27-year-old man , identified in the press only as peter a. , is accused of stealing the shoes of nine women while they were actually still wearing them .
his modus operandi was simple and sometimes somewhat painful for his victims , however comically the crimes have been reported in the local press .
he would seek out a woman wearing high heels , sneak up behind her , shove her to the ground , then snatch the shoes off her feet before running off with them .
his victims , suffering from shock and grazed hands and knees as well as having been left bare-footed , were in no position to give chase .
stiletto stealer the man was dubbed the " stiletto stealer from troisdorf " -lrb- or more literally and prosaically the shoe stealer or pumps raueber in german -rrb- because he committed six such robberies around the small town situated near bonn .
he then widened his beat to include leverkusen , cologne and even the metro station near deutsche welle headquarters in bonn .
professor dirk zimmer of the tuebingen academy of behavioral therapy says that shoe fetishism or " retifism , " is the result of some kind of sexual repression in childhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in the annual berlin stiletto sprint it is not known whether peter a. tuned into the annual stiletto sprint race which was run in berlin on saturday .
it was won by 18-year-old julia plecher , who was awarded € 10,000 for running 100 metres in 14.2 seconds .
but police have said the shoe-robber has since offered a " partial confession " of his crimes. td / ap / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .

he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .

german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.07.2009 euroskeptics ' growing power in brussels raises concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are set to be a major presence in brussels opponents of european integration have had their hand strengthened with the recent election of right-wing members from britain .
the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .

in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.07.2009 euroskeptics ' growing power in brussels raises concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are set to be a major presence in brussels opponents of european integration have had their hand strengthened with the recent election of right-wing members from britain .
the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.07.2009 euroskeptics ' growing power in brussels raises concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are set to be a major presence in brussels opponents of european integration have had their hand strengthened with the recent election of right-wing members from britain .
the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .

german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

it 's the first formula one win for the 32-year-old . red bull 's mark webber has won the german grand prix from pole position at the nuerburgring circuit .
this is the first formula one win for the australian . germany 's sebastian vettel , also racing for red bull , finished second and brazilian felipe massa driving for ferrari was third .
jenson button , who leads the formula one standings , finished fifth . 32-year-old webber , in his 130th f1 race after eight years in the sport , came home 9.3 seconds clear of vettel as he raced to a victory that threw the fight for the world championship wide open . overcome by emotion after crossing the finish line , the australian said his victory was " incredible . "
it was the first victory for an australian since alan jones won in las vegas in 1981 . " it 's an incredible day for me , " said webber .
" i wanted to win so badly after silverstone .
i thought i had a good chance there . " " after pole i knew i was in a good position to win the race , i thought the only thing that could beat me or test me even more was the rain , but that held off .

i had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm , " he said . it has been a difficult season for webber , who fractured his leg in a bicycle accident in january but recovered quickly enough to be ready at the start of the season . barrichello took an early lead but faded eventually to sixth .
the poor finish promped an angry outburst at his team . " it was a good show from the team on how to lose a race today , " he said .
" i 'm terribly upset with the way things went .
i did all i had to do .
i went first on the first corner and then they made me lose the race . " vettel , 22 , and also on the red bull team , was slightly more gracious . " congratulations to him , " he said referring to webber .
" today he was unbeatable so he totally deserved to win .
another one-two finish for the team - that 's so good . " webber is now third in the title race with 45.5 points behind leader briton jenson button on 68 points and vettel on 47 . the next race is the hungarian grand prix on july 26 . jam / td / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 12.07.2009 euroskeptics ' growing power in brussels raises concerns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eurosceptics are set to be a major presence in brussels opponents of european integration have had their hand strengthened with the recent election of right-wing members from britain .
the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .

marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .

" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .

marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "

a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2009 green good intentions cause chaos in two german towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geothermal drilling was in staufen 's historic town center residents near dortmund were evacuated this week after the ground collapsed around a geothermal heat pump , while in another german town , almost 190 buildings have now been damaged by a geothermal project gone awry . residents of the small town of kamen , near dortmund , had a shock this week when ground around a construction site collapsed as a result of drilling for a geothermal heat pump .
many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

the suspect arrested by police on saturday , is likely to bring to an end a series of shoe robberies which began in 2008 .
nine victims the 27-year-old man , identified in the press only as peter a. , is accused of stealing the shoes of nine women while they were actually still wearing them .
his modus operandi was simple and sometimes somewhat painful for his victims , however comically the crimes have been reported in the local press .
he would seek out a woman wearing high heels , sneak up behind her , shove her to the ground , then snatch the shoes off her feet before running off with them .
his victims , suffering from shock and grazed hands and knees as well as having been left bare-footed , were in no position to give chase .
stiletto stealer the man was dubbed the " stiletto stealer from troisdorf " -lrb- or more literally and prosaically the shoe stealer or pumps raueber in german -rrb- because he committed six such robberies around the small town situated near bonn .
he then widened his beat to include leverkusen , cologne and even the metro station near deutsche welle headquarters in bonn .
professor dirk zimmer of the tuebingen academy of behavioral therapy says that shoe fetishism or " retifism , " is the result of some kind of sexual repression in childhood .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2009 green good intentions cause chaos in two german towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geothermal drilling was in staufen 's historic town center residents near dortmund were evacuated this week after the ground collapsed around a geothermal heat pump , while in another german town , almost 190 buildings have now been damaged by a geothermal project gone awry . residents of the small town of kamen , near dortmund , had a shock this week when ground around a construction site collapsed as a result of drilling for a geothermal heat pump .
many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .

david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 12.07.2009 hertha berlin are hoping cleverness can make up for lack of cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odds are against hertha continuing last season 's rise money = transfers = success .
that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .

that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .

in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .

the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .

that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "

in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .

he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .

eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .
" we realize that anything else would be a mistake . "
british extremists to take seats in brussels many british politicians fear the biggest fuss will be caused by the arrival of the openly racist british national party , which , for the first time , has secured two seats in the european parliament .
still , the high profile of british extremists does not mean there has been a surge of support for the far-right , according to the economist 's rennie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british national party 's leader nick griffin will find fellow travelers in brussels for one thing , the british national party actually did no better in these european elections than last time .
the difference is that this time around the labour vote collapsed .
he attributes the rise of the far right to the collapse of the left , which boasts its own strand of euroskepticism .
" when france voted ' no ' to the constitution , that was a vote from the far-left and communist parties , " he said .
in the new eu parliament , the actual number of euroskeptic meps may not have increased , but sitting in their new constellations , their voices could be louder than ever .

the euroskeptic bloc in brussels is wielding more power than ever before . amid the bland blue , grey and white neutrality of the debating chamber , a collection of mini-union jacks on a collection of tables stands out .
the european parliament members next to these flags are from the united kingdom independence party -lrb- ukip -rrb- , whose goal is to take the uk out of the european union .
until now , it was seen as a party on the fringe , but ever since european elections in june , hardline euroskeptics are moving toward center stage .
even allowing for different strands of euroskepticism , opponents of deeper eu integration have never been so numerous nor so prominent .
more than half of britain 's 72 meps will now be sitting in groups opposed to deeper political union .
britain 's conservative party has made good on its threat to leave the main center-right grouping in the european parliament and form its own alliance with politicians from across europe opposed to deeper political union .
extreme right in eu parliament is bigger despite the recent moves by britain 's conservatives , hardline euroskeptics of ukip accuse the party of hypocrisy .
ukip spokesman , andrew reed , says the new tory-led grouping can not call itself euroskeptic if it agrees to work within the bloc 's current structures , including the european commission , the european council and the european parliament .
bildunterschrift : krisztina morvai of hungary 's far right-wing group " jobbik " " we are the other side of that line , which requires that the electorate be sovereign , " reed said .
david rennie of the weekly economist also sees a dilemma for british conservative party leader david cameron . rennie says the conservative chief is trawling for moderate voters back home by suggesting tackling climate change at the european level and by supporting gay rights .
the paradox , according to rennie , is that cameron has had to veer deep into the angry nationalist and socially conservative right to find allies who share his euroskeptic views .
" if you are then aligning yourself deliberately and choosing new members for a group , and you choose parties that do n't believe in climate change or think that homosexuality is a wicked sin , you do open yourself up to the allegation of hypocrisy , " rennie said .
the ukip has also founded its own grouping , and some of its allies are criticized as populist and anti-immigration .
but spokesman reed says the group 's members are united by a common goal : to restore the sovereign state as the chief ruler of europe .
reed does not like the term european parliament , but for the time being is prepared to play by the rules in exchange for extra speaking time and clout .
without a grouping , the ukip would have been stranded on the independent benches .
" i do n't think we ever intended to go it alone in the eu 's consultative body , which i refuse to call a parliament , " he said .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

the suspect arrested by police on saturday , is likely to bring to an end a series of shoe robberies which began in 2008 .
nine victims the 27-year-old man , identified in the press only as peter a. , is accused of stealing the shoes of nine women while they were actually still wearing them .
his modus operandi was simple and sometimes somewhat painful for his victims , however comically the crimes have been reported in the local press .
he would seek out a woman wearing high heels , sneak up behind her , shove her to the ground , then snatch the shoes off her feet before running off with them .
his victims , suffering from shock and grazed hands and knees as well as having been left bare-footed , were in no position to give chase .
stiletto stealer the man was dubbed the " stiletto stealer from troisdorf " -lrb- or more literally and prosaically the shoe stealer or pumps raueber in german -rrb- because he committed six such robberies around the small town situated near bonn .
he then widened his beat to include leverkusen , cologne and even the metro station near deutsche welle headquarters in bonn .
professor dirk zimmer of the tuebingen academy of behavioral therapy says that shoe fetishism or " retifism , " is the result of some kind of sexual repression in childhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in the annual berlin stiletto sprint it is not known whether peter a. tuned into the annual stiletto sprint race which was run in berlin on saturday .
it was won by 18-year-old julia plecher , who was awarded € 10,000 for running 100 metres in 14.2 seconds .
but police have said the shoe-robber has since offered a " partial confession " of his crimes. td / ap / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 12.07.2009 hertha berlin are hoping cleverness can make up for lack of cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the odds are against hertha continuing last season 's rise money = transfers = success .
that 's the football formula last season 's fourth-placed team is trying to disprove .
dw-world 's jefferson chase looks at whether hertha berlin can solve a tough equation . there wo n't be any record signings in the german capital this summer .
in 2008-09 , hertha berlin broke out of the mid-table doldrums and earned more points than ever before , but if you think that would be cause for a spending spree , you do n't know hertha 's books .
the " old lady , " as the club is known , is bent on reducing its personnel costs by five million euros -lrb- $ 7 million -rrb- .
that 's led to the departures of the squad 's two top strikers , marko pantelic and andriy voronin , and the consensus choice for the bundesliga 's best defensive player last year , josip simunic .
in fact , hertha only have around 25 million euros in total for players - significantly less than one-third of what real madrid paid to pry cristiano ronaldo from manchester united .
conventional wisdom would say that hertha are heading for a precipitous fall this autumn .
but the club thinks it can build on last season 's success and balance the books - thanks to a new general manager , a no-nonsense strategist as a coach and at least one very unorthodox acquisition .
second chance for king artur bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wichniarek , right , will rejoin hertha after three years with bielefeld hertha 's main move thus far - other than selling simunic for seven million euros - is to bring back one of the most reviled former players in recent years : striker artur wichniarek .
the polish forward spent two hapless years in the capital from 2003 to 2005 , scoring just four goals in 44 appearances .
hertha have chosen to ignore that bleak bit of the past for two reasons : wichniarek 's record at his former club bielefeld is impressive - 83 goals in 207 matches - and he 's keen .
king artur 's lack of success in the capital reportedly gnawed at him so much that he was willing to fork out a quarter of a million euros of his own money to buy himself out of his bielefeld contract and take another crack at conquering berlin .
hertha also have two promising but largely untested young forwards - valeri domovchiyski and armine chermiti - who they hope can make quantum leaps in 2009-10 .
but the weight of expectations - and the habitual skepticism of hertha 's supporters - will be on wichniarek , who ended his last tenure in berlin in utter acrimony and whose return was only made possible by the departure of a former enemy .
hoeness out , preetz in bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : new manager preetz , left , knows a thing or two about scoring goals hertha 's first move of the off-season was to oust dieter hoeness as its long-time general manager .
when the former bayern striker came to the club in 1996 , it was struggling to stay in the second division .
under hoeness , hertha quickly established itself in the top flight and once even qualified for the champions league .
but hoeness came under increasing pressure for some expensive transfer flops -lrb- chiefly brazilian strikers -rrb- and for his propensity to make grandiose pronouncements in the media .
the fact that impecunious hertha were willing to part with a million euros to get him to resign in june is a sign of how much the club wanted him gone .
hertha 's all-time leading goal scorer michael preetz has taken over , inheriting both hoeness ' achievements and some 25 million euros in debts that he racked up while trying to heave berlin into the upper echelons of european soccer .
during his career on the pitch , preetz was known as an efficient , but also affable and intelligent player so there 's reason to believe he can be convincing with potential signees .
but more importantly , he gets on well with the man who has now been given unprecedented power to form the squad - coach lucien favre .
lulu 's baby bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach favre is clearly the man in charge in only two seasons with the club , " lulu " favre has completely remade hertha .
only five players remain from the squad he took over in 2007 , and the swiss coach has focused on building up a multi-talented , young midfield .
serbian gojko kacar and brazilians cicero and raffael in particular impressed last season , scoring 19 goals between them .
manchester united are rumored to be keeping kacar under observation and are said to believe that the 22-year-old all-rounder is worth at least 12 million euros .
hertha also reportedly turned down a 10-million-euro offer from french side olympique lyon for raffael .
basically hertha believe that with that trio , plus german national defender arne friedrich and rock-steady keeper jaroslav drobny , the squad has a solid core capable of improving next season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hertha 's young talents are going to have step up and favre 's insistence that his charges be capable of playing multiple positions means that he 's better able to compensate for injuries and suspensions than most coaches .
still , expectations are one thing , and results another , and many teams have been burned when younger players did n't make the progress their bosses envisioned for them .
if hertha are able to maintain or surpass their level of play last season while cutting the budget , it will solidify favre 's argument that he is building a team of the future .
but if the goals do n't come up front , or the back four folds without simunic , or the midfield trio stagnates , hertha could find itself having to borrow some money in mid-season just to stave off collapse .

but the country 's poor did not join the celebration .
they fear the upcoming sporting event wo n't benefit them . the empty seats during some of the recent confederations cup games were a clear indicator of the economic strain poor south africans have to live with .
even the international football federation fifa 's effort to issue free tickets to locals in an attempt to fill stadiums failed in its attempt to make the tournament popular among the country 's poor .
eva davids did not receive a free ticket , but she would not have wanted one either .
four years ago , she was forcefully evicted from her house in western cape province of south africa because the government needed space to construct a road in preparation for the world cup .
she is now a member of an ngo that fights evictions . " it is already hard to find a -lrb- council -rrb- house .
now you are in a -lrb- council -rrb- house and get evicted , " she said .
her family and their neighbours had to wait for years to find a new place to live .
" we were so underprivileged .
sometimes there were more than 50 people living in one house . " she says the money spent in preparation for the event should have been invested in the education of poor south africans , like her and her family .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people had to make way for construction of world cup facilities but others tell a different story , like ndivhuwo mabaya , a spokesman from south africa 's ministry of housing and human settlement .
in his view , the new infrastructure will boost the economy and improve the lives of the poor as well .
he also denies that there are evictions taking place .
" we are not evicting people , we are relocating people temporarily in order to prepare the land for development , " mabaya said .
according to the ministry , all people will be resettled to new government-built houses .
lack of sustainable jobs due to the huge popularity of football , the economic impact of the world cup on south africa is likely to be considerable .
the international marketing council of south africa believes that the world cup will boost south africa 's image , often tarnished by news about violent crime .
according to optimistic estimates , more than 450,000 tourists from overseas will visit the event .
the south african government plans to spend a total of $ 2.2 billion on new stadiums and infrastructure upgrades .
according to president jacob zuma , 400,000 new jobs have been created - a welcome relief in a country where more the unemployment rates tops 20 percent .
but there are still concerns .
" this is not like that in building the stadiums they will develop skills that will translate into having long-term jobs that will give them a livelihood for the rest of their lives , " said ashwan desai from the university of johannesburg .
he says most jobs will be lost again once the world cup has come to an end .
south africa has not been immune from the effects of the global recession and economic sectors such as the construction industry will decline once the world cup preparations are over .
other benefits bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : perhaps the event can become a unifying factor for the country despite the ongoing debate about the strength or weakness of economic gains from the world cup for ordinary south africans , many football fans , both rich and poor , hope it will bring other benefits .
they hope that the games will be a unifying factor in a society that is heavily divided along ethnic , social and gender lines .
their dream is a repetition of the 2006 world cup in germany , where fans from all walks of life came together to cheer on their national teams .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 12.07.2009 green good intentions cause chaos in two german towns großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the geothermal drilling was in staufen 's historic town center residents near dortmund were evacuated this week after the ground collapsed around a geothermal heat pump , while in another german town , almost 190 buildings have now been damaged by a geothermal project gone awry . residents of the small town of kamen , near dortmund , had a shock this week when ground around a construction site collapsed as a result of drilling for a geothermal heat pump .
many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

it 's the first formula one win for the 32-year-old . red bull 's mark webber has won the german grand prix from pole position at the nuerburgring circuit .
this is the first formula one win for the australian . germany 's sebastian vettel , also racing for red bull , finished second and brazilian felipe massa driving for ferrari was third .
jenson button , who leads the formula one standings , finished fifth . 32-year-old webber , in his 130th f1 race after eight years in the sport , came home 9.3 seconds clear of vettel as he raced to a victory that threw the fight for the world championship wide open . overcome by emotion after crossing the finish line , the australian said his victory was " incredible . "
it was the first victory for an australian since alan jones won in las vegas in 1981 . " it 's an incredible day for me , " said webber .
" i wanted to win so badly after silverstone .
i thought i had a good chance there . " " after pole i knew i was in a good position to win the race , i thought the only thing that could beat me or test me even more was the rain , but that held off . " early problems webber overcame a drive-through penalty after a first-lap contact with brawn 's rubens barrichello but the australian 's car turned out to be the superior one in the race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull driver sebastian vettel steers his car at the nuerburgring racetrack " i lost rubens off the start , i thought he had gone to the left , but he went right and i banged into him .
i had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm , " he said . it has been a difficult season for webber , who fractured his leg in a bicycle accident in january but recovered quickly enough to be ready at the start of the season . barrichello took an early lead but faded eventually to sixth .
the poor finish promped an angry outburst at his team . " it was a good show from the team on how to lose a race today , " he said .
" i 'm terribly upset with the way things went .
i did all i had to do .
i went first on the first corner and then they made me lose the race . " vettel , 22 , and also on the red bull team , was slightly more gracious . " congratulations to him , " he said referring to webber .
" today he was unbeatable so he totally deserved to win .

the suspect arrested by police on saturday , is likely to bring to an end a series of shoe robberies which began in 2008 .
nine victims the 27-year-old man , identified in the press only as peter a. , is accused of stealing the shoes of nine women while they were actually still wearing them .
his modus operandi was simple and sometimes somewhat painful for his victims , however comically the crimes have been reported in the local press .
he would seek out a woman wearing high heels , sneak up behind her , shove her to the ground , then snatch the shoes off her feet before running off with them .
his victims , suffering from shock and grazed hands and knees as well as having been left bare-footed , were in no position to give chase .
stiletto stealer the man was dubbed the " stiletto stealer from troisdorf " -lrb- or more literally and prosaically the shoe stealer or pumps raueber in german -rrb- because he committed six such robberies around the small town situated near bonn .
he then widened his beat to include leverkusen , cologne and even the metro station near deutsche welle headquarters in bonn .
professor dirk zimmer of the tuebingen academy of behavioral therapy says that shoe fetishism or " retifism , " is the result of some kind of sexual repression in childhood .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : competitors in the annual berlin stiletto sprint it is not known whether peter a. tuned into the annual stiletto sprint race which was run in berlin on saturday .
it was won by 18-year-old julia plecher , who was awarded € 10,000 for running 100 metres in 14.2 seconds .
but police have said the shoe-robber has since offered a " partial confession " of his crimes. td / ap / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have really enjoyed the last two days especially .
the spectators were amazing the way they supported us , " kaymer told reporters after the round . " this week was very special because scotland is the home of golf , " he added .
kaymer topped spaniard gonzalo fernandez-castano by two shots .
fernandez-castano had held the overnight lead after a sparkling saturday 64 but failed to hold on for the win on sunday , shooting a final round one-over-par 72 .

" everyone is asking me if i can win three in a row but it is a major we are playing this week and the field will be the best we have all year long , " kaymer told reporters when asked about his chances at turnberry . but come as it may , sunday 's victory at loch lomond solidifies the 24-year-old 's position as one of europe 's finest golfers . past scottish open winners include major champions ernie els -lrb- south africa -rrb- and tom lehman -lrb- united states -rrb- , and colin montgomerie of scotland , who was long regarded as europe 's top player . the win is kaymer ’ s fourth on the european tour and places him second with alex cejka on the list of most prolific german winners , behind only bernhard langer . glb / reuters / pgaeuropeantour.com editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after last week ’ s triumph in france , martin kaymer wasted no time in securing his next victory , the scottish open at the loch lomond golf club in glasgow . with four steady scores in the sixties -lrb- 69 , 65 , 66 , and a final round 69 -rrb- , kaymer notched the fourth win of his young career , following last week 's open de france victory at le golf national outside of paris .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solid on the fairways of loch lomond kaymer 's 72-hole total of 15-under-par 269 at loch lomond gc was good enough to give the young german a two-shot victory .
" i have really enjoyed the last two days especially .
the spectators were amazing the way they supported us , " kaymer told reporters after the round . " this week was very special because scotland is the home of golf , " he added .
kaymer topped spaniard gonzalo fernandez-castano by two shots .
fernandez-castano had held the overnight lead after a sparkling saturday 64 but failed to hold on for the win on sunday , shooting a final round one-over-par 72 .
raphael jacquelin of france shared second place with fernandez-castano , after two sterling rounds of 5-under-par 66 on the weekend .

" everyone is asking me if i can win three in a row but it is a major we are playing this week and the field will be the best we have all year long , " kaymer told reporters when asked about his chances at turnberry . but come as it may , sunday 's victory at loch lomond solidifies the 24-year-old 's position as one of europe 's finest golfers . past scottish open winners include major champions ernie els -lrb- south africa -rrb- and tom lehman -lrb- united states -rrb- , and colin montgomerie of scotland , who was long regarded as europe 's top player . the win is kaymer ’ s fourth on the european tour and places him second with alex cejka on the list of most prolific german winners , behind only bernhard langer . glb / reuters / pgaeuropeantour.com editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .

german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

it 's the first formula one win for the 32-year-old . red bull 's mark webber has won the german grand prix from pole position at the nuerburgring circuit .
this is the first formula one win for the australian . germany 's sebastian vettel , also racing for red bull , finished second and brazilian felipe massa driving for ferrari was third .
jenson button , who leads the formula one standings , finished fifth . 32-year-old webber , in his 130th f1 race after eight years in the sport , came home 9.3 seconds clear of vettel as he raced to a victory that threw the fight for the world championship wide open . overcome by emotion after crossing the finish line , the australian said his victory was " incredible . "
it was the first victory for an australian since alan jones won in las vegas in 1981 . " it 's an incredible day for me , " said webber .
" i wanted to win so badly after silverstone .
i thought i had a good chance there . " " after pole i knew i was in a good position to win the race , i thought the only thing that could beat me or test me even more was the rain , but that held off . " early problems webber overcame a drive-through penalty after a first-lap contact with brawn 's rubens barrichello but the australian 's car turned out to be the superior one in the race . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : red bull driver sebastian vettel steers his car at the nuerburgring racetrack " i lost rubens off the start , i thought he had gone to the left , but he went right and i banged into him .
i had a drive-through and my engineer kept me calm , " he said . it has been a difficult season for webber , who fractured his leg in a bicycle accident in january but recovered quickly enough to be ready at the start of the season . barrichello took an early lead but faded eventually to sixth .
the poor finish promped an angry outburst at his team . " it was a good show from the team on how to lose a race today , " he said .
" i 'm terribly upset with the way things went .
i did all i had to do .
i went first on the first corner and then they made me lose the race . " vettel , 22 , and also on the red bull team , was slightly more gracious . " congratulations to him , " he said referring to webber .
" today he was unbeatable so he totally deserved to win .
another one-two finish for the team - that 's so good . " webber is now third in the title race with 45.5 points behind leader briton jenson button on 68 points and vettel on 47 . the next race is the hungarian grand prix on july 26 . jam / td / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

many locals had to be evacuated amid fears that houses could collapse , and many nearby buildings now have long cracks in the walls . for residents of the southern german village of staufen , the news came as little surprise : their town began sinking - and then rising - as a result of geothermal drilling almost two years ago .
until then , staufen had just been a quaint day-trip destination , visited by german pensioners looking for a slice of black forest cake and history buffs drawn to the town 's links to johann georg faust , the legendary alchemist and magician , who - so the story goes - made a pact with the devil here .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the inner walls of the new town hall are badly damaged but in 2007 , staufen became known in germany for another reason .
the town council decided to do its bit for the environment and use geothermal power to heat the newly refurbished historic and new town halls .
in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "
tourism boost ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

in september that year , the council hired a company to drill deep into the earth 's surface to harness the geothermal power there .
a few weeks later , fine cracks began appearing in the walls and floors of the town halls and surrounding buildings , including the historic guest house where faust is believed to have stayed .
at least 187 buildings now have cracks , some up to 15 centimeters wide .
" we 'll have to use hiking boots " initially , parts of the town began sinking , but now the earth is rising .
during the digging , water came into contact with anhydrite : a mineral , which – when exposed to water – expands and turns into gypsum .
that has been causing the earth to swell , pushing the buildings up with it , and causing the cracks .
authorities are now drilling to find out if the swelling process can be stopped .
staufen mayor michael benitz told deutsche welle that there are thousands of similar drilling projects in the state of baden-wuerttemberg alone , and he can not understand why staufen has had such problems .
" these drillings were all over the place and this swelling phenomenon did n't appear anywhere else , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some of the windows in the new town hall now have support beams staufen authorities say the ground under the city has been rising by up to one centimeter a month - a very significant amount in geological terms - and while they say that no buildings are in danger of collapsing , they have had to use wooden beams to reinforce windows in the new town hall .
marianne pfadt , a local tour guide , says the damage runs right through the center of staufen .
" if this continues , we 'll have to use hiking boots to get into town , " she said , laughing .
no one to blame pfadt may be able to joke about the situation in her home of 20 years , but in truth , she and other locals are angry .
one resident watching helplessly is claudia woelfle , manager of a café which backs onto the drilling site .
the facade of her business along with the stone floor inside are covered with cracks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cracks can be seen throughout town " you can see that they are getting bigger and bigger , " woelfle said .
" and more and more are appearing , too . "
even though the cracks appeared shortly after the geothermal project began , there is still no hard evidence to prove that drilling is behind the problem .
regular tectonic activity underneath the city could also be responsible - but that is unlikely .
however , the lack of proof means that legally , locals have no one to blame and no one to foot the bill , which is expected to run into the millions .
pfadt says locals do not how they are going to pay for the damage .
" they 're desperate , " pfadt says .
" -lrb- these houses are -rrb- their old age pension , " she says .
" everybody plans , ' oh , in old age , i 'll sell the house and move ' , but you ca n't sell these houses . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : castle ruins on the edge of staufen are one of the attractions for tourists pfadt says locals have been sending angry letters to local newspapers , and some have threatened to go to court to get repair bills paid .
in the meantime , the town council has set up a fund for donations to help pay for the damage , and local businesses may even get a slight boost from day-trippers who are curious about staufen 's cracking problem .
a new influx of tourists would be at least a bit of welcome news for staufen 's residents , since authorities have been unable to say when , or if , the swelling - and cracking - will stop .

" i have really enjoyed the last two days especially .
the spectators were amazing the way they supported us , " kaymer told reporters after the round . " this week was very special because scotland is the home of golf , " he added .

fernandez-castano had held the overnight lead after a sparkling saturday 64 but failed to hold on for the win on sunday , shooting a final round one-over-par 72 .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .

the meeting comes a day after reports that qatar wants a stake in porsche . the meeting in the austrian city of salzburg is thought to have been a precursor to an extraordinary meeting of porsche 's supervisory board on july 23 .
it is unclear what was discussed at the meeting , but the bid from the gulf emirate of qatar would surely have been on the agenda .
the state-run qatar investment authority has reportedly offered seven billion euros for a 25-percent stake in porsche holding se and options on volkswagen shares held by porsche .
german newsmagazine der spiegel has also reported that volkswagen has increased its bid to more than four billion euros for a 49-percent stake in porsche 's sports car operations .
porsche rejected volkswagen 's earlier offer of three to four billion euros , saying it was not a " practical solution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche currently owns 51 percent of volkswagen porsche needs a cash injection to help it cover debts of nine billion euros , accumulated as a result of a attempt to increase its stake in volkswagen last year .
it won the bulk of the shares , but not control in the wolfsburg-based company .
german automotive analyst ferdinand dudenhoeffer told deutsche welle that he thinks qatar is the best option because the deal would bring " fresh money " into porsche and vw .
dudenhoeffer says however that ferdinand piech , the head of volkswagen 's supervisory board and a major shareholder in porsche , is the one person who could stand in the way of a deal with qatar .
piech stands to benefit from a deal with volkswagen , whereas a deal with qatar would clear a large chunk of porsche 's debt and strengthen the position of porsche ceo , wendelin wiedeking , who is deeply opposed to piech 's plans to integrate porsche into volkswagen .
a porsche spokesperson said on friday that the company 's goal remained " the creation of an integrated group " with volkswagen .
