according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 30.12.2009 europe showcases its cultural heavyweights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ruhr region will be one of europe 's capitals of culture in 2010 with its cultural capitals , europe seeks to show off the various facets of cultural wealth across the continent .
so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .
volkswagen also locked in the next two places , with its skoda coming in second and its compact polo coming in third .
the program did n't only benefit vw .
opel announced this week that its sales in germany increased by 31 percent for 2009 compared with 2008 , much of which was attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program how low can they go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers showed they 're willing to buy , if the price is right yet the cash-for-clunkers program , which cost the government about five billion euros , ended in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.12.2009 dutch officials announce full-body scans for schiphol airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the body scanners are to come into use for us flights within three weeks the netherlands says it will introduce full-body scans for passengers travelling to the united states in the wake of a plot to bomb a us passenger plane .
some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian striker has had a rocky season with bayern , spending most of his time on the sidelines .
toni , 32 , said he hoped to use the move to regain his place with the italy team for the 2010 world cup .
toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .
the move has not been officially announced , although earlier in the month , bayern president uli hoeness said toni could leave on a free transfer .
in an interview to be published on thursday , hoeness wished toni well at his new club .
" i hope he plays a super second half of the season at as rom and that he shoots a lot of goals , " hoeness told the munich merkur .
unhappy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni , left , did not see eye to eye with bayern coach louis van gaal toni 's signing with bayern in 2007 was supposed to be the start of a new era of dominance for the german club .
coming off his world cup win , toni seemed unstoppable .
he soon became the bundesliga 's top scorer as well as the german league 's best paid player .
his second bundesliga season , while not as stellar , still saw him score 14 goals .
yet toni started his third season out with an injury .
in his absence , bayern 's new coach , louis van gaal , turned to miroslav klose to take on the club 's central striking role with franck ribery and arjen robben lending support .
toni and van gaal reportedly had a falling out with toni losing his place on the first team. th / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .

polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 30.12.2009 europe showcases its cultural heavyweights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ruhr region will be one of europe 's capitals of culture in 2010 with its cultural capitals , europe seeks to show off the various facets of cultural wealth across the continent .
so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .
museum authorities say they hope to have the sign restored by january to mark the 65th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by the soviet red army. ai / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .

security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .

it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

the italian striker has had a rocky season with bayern , spending most of his time on the sidelines .
toni , 32 , said he hoped to use the move to regain his place with the italy team for the 2010 world cup .
toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .
the move has not been officially announced , although earlier in the month , bayern president uli hoeness said toni could leave on a free transfer .
in an interview to be published on thursday , hoeness wished toni well at his new club .
" i hope he plays a super second half of the season at as rom and that he shoots a lot of goals , " hoeness told the munich merkur .
unhappy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni , left , did not see eye to eye with bayern coach louis van gaal toni 's signing with bayern in 2007 was supposed to be the start of a new era of dominance for the german club .
coming off his world cup win , toni seemed unstoppable .
he soon became the bundesliga 's top scorer as well as the german league 's best paid player .
his second bundesliga season , while not as stellar , still saw him score 14 goals .
yet toni started his third season out with an injury .
in his absence , bayern 's new coach , louis van gaal , turned to miroslav klose to take on the club 's central striking role with franck ribery and arjen robben lending support .
toni and van gaal reportedly had a falling out with toni losing his place on the first team. th / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .

and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

" there exists a probable risk of an attack due to the special significance of the christmas holiday period , spain 's upcoming eu presidency , and after an evaluation of the risks of a terrorist threat at home conducted by spain 's armed and security forces , " the ministry said in a statement late on tuesday .
the statement also noted the " persistent international terrorist threat " after the alleged attempt to blow up a delta plane headed for detroit on december 25 .
" eta will attempt to prove it is still alive " the move came after interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba on monday warned that the basque separatist group eta was planning attacks and kidnappings during spain 's upcoming six-month eu presidency .
" eta has been squeezed by the police and justice systems , it 's societally isolated , it 's been put under international pressure , especially by france , and it 's divided internally , " the minister said .
" under these conditions , it can be expected that eta will attempt to prove it is still alive . "
eta is considered a terrorist organization by spain as well as the eu and the us .
the group is held responsible for 828 deaths in the last four decades in their campaign for independent in the basque region of northern spain and southwest france. ai / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .
museum authorities say they hope to have the sign restored by january to mark the 65th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by the soviet red army. ai / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .
volkswagen also locked in the next two places , with its skoda coming in second and its compact polo coming in third .
the program did n't only benefit vw .
opel announced this week that its sales in germany increased by 31 percent for 2009 compared with 2008 , much of which was attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program how low can they go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers showed they 're willing to buy , if the price is right yet the cash-for-clunkers program , which cost the government about five billion euros , ended in september .
the government announced that it has no plans to renew it .
that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .

"
pecs is one of three cities that will bear the title in 2010 . each year , at least one city is chosen as the european capital of culture .

toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .
the move has not been officially announced , although earlier in the month , bayern president uli hoeness said toni could leave on a free transfer .
in an interview to be published on thursday , hoeness wished toni well at his new club .
" i hope he plays a super second half of the season at as rom and that he shoots a lot of goals , " hoeness told the munich merkur .
unhappy ending bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : luca toni , left , did not see eye to eye with bayern coach louis van gaal toni 's signing with bayern in 2007 was supposed to be the start of a new era of dominance for the german club .
coming off his world cup win , toni seemed unstoppable .
he soon became the bundesliga 's top scorer as well as the german league 's best paid player .
his second bundesliga season , while not as stellar , still saw him score 14 goals .
yet toni started his third season out with an injury .
in his absence , bayern 's new coach , louis van gaal , turned to miroslav klose to take on the club 's central striking role with franck ribery and arjen robben lending support .
toni and van gaal reportedly had a falling out with toni losing his place on the first team. th / ap / dpa editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .

justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .

in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .

dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "

polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .
museum authorities say they hope to have the sign restored by january to mark the 65th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by the soviet red army. ai / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .

the council said it could not accept more job cuts . in an interview published on wednesday in the german daily frankfurter rundschau , franz said the company could not accept more job losses .
gm has said it plans to cut around 8,300 jobs from opel 's 50,000-strong european workforce .
" as far as we are concerned , the loss of 9,000 jobs in europe is unacceptable , " franz said . he added that the job cuts were " economic nonsense , " and that opel would already be losing about 10,500 jobs by 2013 through voluntary departures and retirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz says the loss of 9,000 opel jobs is ' unacceptable ' more support needed from gm franz maintained his position that gm needs to provide more financial support for opel 's restructuring .
the american parent company estimates that the restructuring will cost around 3.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- and has asked european union countries with opel facilities to help foot the bill .
however , gm itself only plans to contribute 600 million euros .
" that will not be enough for the politicians , " franz said .
opel has already lost an estimated 800 million euros due to prolonged restructuring plans .
' cash-for-clunkers ' plan helped opel sales despite the money lost due to restructuring , opel announced tuesday that its sales in germany for 2009 increased by 31 percent compared to 2008 .
this is largely due to the german government 's cash-for-clunkers program , which encouraged potential car buyers to trade in their older vehicles for more fuel efficient newer cars .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel sales in germany went up 31 percent this year the company said 339,000 vehicles were sold this year , making 2009 opel 's best year for sales since 2005 .
opel and its british sister brand vauxhall experienced a great deal of uncertainty this year .
gm was set to sell the european operations to canadian auto parts group magna international and its russian partner sberbank , but later backed out on the deal .
negotiations on opel 's restructuring are to continue next month. mk / afp / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .

"
pecs is one of three cities that will bear the title in 2010 . each year , at least one city is chosen as the european capital of culture .
the title is awarded by the council of the european union after best-candidate recommendations are made by the european commission .
the status helps the chosen city to showcase its cultural life and cultural development , thereby promoting european integration . three cities have been chosen as european capitals of culture for 2010 : istanbul in turkey , essen in germany and the rather-unknown pecs in south-western hungary . in germany , there is currently great excitement about essen 's up-coming culture capital status .
what few germans realize , however , is that pecs too , is influenced by german culture . romans , turks and germans : pecs , a city of settlers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pecs ' architecture reflects the different chapters in its history around 300 years ago , germans settlers named the hungarian city " five churches " -lrb- " fuenfkirchen " -rrb- , referring to its latin name " quinque basilicae " -lrb- " five cathedrals " -rrb- . " the roman settlement had a very small inner city , " local historian johann habel said .
" it also apparently had a small city wall , but only a section of it has been found .
we do n't know what other parts can be found underground . " like so many of pecs inhabitants , habel is a descendent of immigrants .
his forefathers were so-called " danube swabians " - germans who settled in the former kingdom of hungary , especially the danube river valley , between the 17th and 19th centuries . the largest wave of german-speaking immigrants arrived as the ottoman turks were gradually being forced back after their defeat at the battle of vienna in 1683 . some 150 years of turkish control had left their mark on pecs , and the new settlers found themselves surrounded by unfamiliar architecture and traditions . " christian churches were turned into mosques or torn down , " habel said .
" then the turks built new mosques , baths , a koran school and a hospital .
in other words , they organized everything according to their taste and tradition . " multicultural heritage rich traces of pecs ' turkish and german heritage can be found side-by-side in today 's pecs .
the city 's main mosque is just one example .
built in the city 's medieval square from the stones of a roman church , it has now been turned into a parish church .
its main wall , however , still faces the direction of mecca and its dome is still decorated by the islamic crescent symbol . " the city has a 2,000-year history , " said julia fabanyi , director of the state museum .
" and the city has been taking care of these 2,000 years of monuments and cultural heritage . " the monuments remain long after the people who built them have disappeared .

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian striker has had a rocky season with bayern , spending most of his time on the sidelines .
toni , 32 , said he hoped to use the move to regain his place with the italy team for the 2010 world cup .
toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .
the move has not been officially announced , although earlier in the month , bayern president uli hoeness said toni could leave on a free transfer .
in an interview to be published on thursday , hoeness wished toni well at his new club .
" i hope he plays a super second half of the season at as rom and that he shoots a lot of goals , " hoeness told the munich merkur .

he soon became the bundesliga 's top scorer as well as the german league 's best paid player .
his second bundesliga season , while not as stellar , still saw him score 14 goals .
yet toni started his third season out with an injury .
in his absence , bayern 's new coach , louis van gaal , turned to miroslav klose to take on the club 's central striking role with franck ribery and arjen robben lending support .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .
volkswagen also locked in the next two places , with its skoda coming in second and its compact polo coming in third .
the program did n't only benefit vw .
opel announced this week that its sales in germany increased by 31 percent for 2009 compared with 2008 , much of which was attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program how low can they go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers showed they 're willing to buy , if the price is right yet the cash-for-clunkers program , which cost the government about five billion euros , ended in september .
the government announced that it has no plans to renew it .
that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .
" i am counting on one or two million more cars being sold in our industry than this year , " vw head martin winterkorn said just before christmas . yet winterkorn notes that the smaller profit margins in such markets means revenues will remain low .
" that is why 2010 will be a pretty tough year , " he said. th / dpa / apd / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .

but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .

pecs is one of three cities that will bear the title in 2010 . each year , at least one city is chosen as the european capital of culture .
the title is awarded by the council of the european union after best-candidate recommendations are made by the european commission .
the status helps the chosen city to showcase its cultural life and cultural development , thereby promoting european integration . three cities have been chosen as european capitals of culture for 2010 : istanbul in turkey , essen in germany and the rather-unknown pecs in south-western hungary . in germany , there is currently great excitement about essen 's up-coming culture capital status .
what few germans realize , however , is that pecs too , is influenced by german culture . romans , turks and germans : pecs , a city of settlers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pecs ' architecture reflects the different chapters in its history around 300 years ago , germans settlers named the hungarian city " five churches " -lrb- " fuenfkirchen " -rrb- , referring to its latin name " quinque basilicae " -lrb- " five cathedrals " -rrb- .

his forefathers were so-called " danube swabians " - germans who settled in the former kingdom of hungary , especially the danube river valley , between the 17th and 19th centuries . the largest wave of german-speaking immigrants arrived as the ottoman turks were gradually being forced back after their defeat at the battle of vienna in 1683 . some 150 years of turkish control had left their mark on pecs , and the new settlers found themselves surrounded by unfamiliar architecture and traditions . " christian churches were turned into mosques or torn down , " habel said .
" then the turks built new mosques , baths , a koran school and a hospital .

body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .

she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .

justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .

his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the council said it could not accept more job cuts . in an interview published on wednesday in the german daily frankfurter rundschau , franz said the company could not accept more job losses .
gm has said it plans to cut around 8,300 jobs from opel 's 50,000-strong european workforce .
" as far as we are concerned , the loss of 9,000 jobs in europe is unacceptable , " franz said . he added that the job cuts were " economic nonsense , " and that opel would already be losing about 10,500 jobs by 2013 through voluntary departures and retirements .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz says the loss of 9,000 opel jobs is ' unacceptable ' more support needed from gm franz maintained his position that gm needs to provide more financial support for opel 's restructuring .
the american parent company estimates that the restructuring will cost around 3.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.6 billion -rrb- and has asked european union countries with opel facilities to help foot the bill .
however , gm itself only plans to contribute 600 million euros .
" that will not be enough for the politicians , " franz said .
opel has already lost an estimated 800 million euros due to prolonged restructuring plans .
' cash-for-clunkers ' plan helped opel sales despite the money lost due to restructuring , opel announced tuesday that its sales in germany for 2009 increased by 31 percent compared to 2008 .
this is largely due to the german government 's cash-for-clunkers program , which encouraged potential car buyers to trade in their older vehicles for more fuel efficient newer cars .

nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .

this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

" there exists a probable risk of an attack due to the special significance of the christmas holiday period , spain 's upcoming eu presidency , and after an evaluation of the risks of a terrorist threat at home conducted by spain 's armed and security forces , " the ministry said in a statement late on tuesday .
the statement also noted the " persistent international terrorist threat " after the alleged attempt to blow up a delta plane headed for detroit on december 25 .
" eta will attempt to prove it is still alive " the move came after interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba on monday warned that the basque separatist group eta was planning attacks and kidnappings during spain 's upcoming six-month eu presidency .
" eta has been squeezed by the police and justice systems , it 's societally isolated , it 's been put under international pressure , especially by france , and it 's divided internally , " the minister said .
" under these conditions , it can be expected that eta will attempt to prove it is still alive . "
eta is considered a terrorist organization by spain as well as the eu and the us .
the group is held responsible for 828 deaths in the last four decades in their campaign for independent in the basque region of northern spain and southwest france. ai / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" there exists a probable risk of an attack due to the special significance of the christmas holiday period , spain 's upcoming eu presidency , and after an evaluation of the risks of a terrorist threat at home conducted by spain 's armed and security forces , " the ministry said in a statement late on tuesday .

" eta will attempt to prove it is still alive " the move came after interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba on monday warned that the basque separatist group eta was planning attacks and kidnappings during spain 's upcoming six-month eu presidency .
" eta has been squeezed by the police and justice systems , it 's societally isolated , it 's been put under international pressure , especially by france , and it 's divided internally , " the minister said .
" under these conditions , it can be expected that eta will attempt to prove it is still alive . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de culture -pipe- 30.12.2009 europe showcases its cultural heavyweights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's ruhr region will be one of europe 's capitals of culture in 2010 with its cultural capitals , europe seeks to show off the various facets of cultural wealth across the continent .
so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .

so what was behind this initiative ? in early 1985 , greek culture minister and former pop star melina mercouri and her french counterpart , jack lang , were passing some time during a stopover at a european airport .
in an excited conversation , the two developed the idea of honoring a city in europe as a cultural capital .
mercouri said she wanted to create something beautiful and enduring while greece then presided over the european community for six months .
" i believe in cultural exchange .
and i think that there should be not only a community of potatoes and tomatoes , but it must also provide for an exchange in an artistic sense , " mercouri said in an early 1985 interview with deutsche welle .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : melina mercouri was one of the architects of the cultural capital program athens was the first capital of culture no sooner said than done ; the greek culture minister summarily made athens the first capital of culture .
the term lasted only a few weeks in the summer of 1985 .
the beginnings were modest as florence , amsterdam , berlin and paris followed athens ' small-scale example .
then in 1990 glasgow put on a much larger series of events that lasted the entire year .
since then , there has been a multi-stage application process with presentations and business plans , almost on the scale of the bidding process for olympic host cities .
the program grew even further in 2004 , when 10 new member states joined the eu to bring the bloc 's total membership to 27 .
" as of 2004 , with the new member states , we realized that we could no longer only have one city as the culture capital , " john macdonald , the eu commission spokesman for culture , said .
" the rotation through every state would have taken too long .
to speed up the process for the eastern european cities , the council of ministers adopted , on average , two capitals every year , " macdonald said .
specific projects such as the renovation of cultural centers , the conversion of brown field sites , or construction of new cultural facilities are the desired ends of the project .
in the french town of lille in 2004 , 12 former industrial buildings were converted into a cultural center .
a museum of modern art was built in luxembourg , which was the cultural capital in 1995 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lille was europe 's capital of culture in 2004 culture as an economic factor a study by the commission says that , overall , the cultural capitals benefit from the honorary title .
but bochum-based historian juergen mittag from the institute for social movements has expressed concerns that the initiative has grown such gigantic proportions that it now lacks focus .
as a capital of culture for 2010 , the ruhr region is uniting thousands of projects in 53 towns and cities .
" this initiative has taken on a life of its own , and now represents much more than a short summer event intended to showcase european identity , " mittag said .
" it is a huge economic factor .
it is a huge media factor .
it 's taken on dimensions that would have been unthinkable in 1985 . "
the budget of the ruhr 2010 project is 65 million euros , which will come from the cities and private sponsors .
the eu is only providing a 1.5 million euro start-up fund .
the cities are expected to develop private and public sources of funding themselves .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the scale of the cultural capital program has grown immensly since 1985 still , cities in europe are queuing up to grab the coveted titles .
the application process is currently decided six years ahead of time .
turku , finland and tallinn , estonia have been selected for 2011 , while guimaraes , portugal and maribor , slovenia have been named capitals for 2012 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 30.12.2009 dutch officials announce full-body scans for schiphol airport großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the body scanners are to come into use for us flights within three weeks the netherlands says it will introduce full-body scans for passengers travelling to the united states in the wake of a plot to bomb a us passenger plane .
some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .

" there exists a probable risk of an attack due to the special significance of the christmas holiday period , spain 's upcoming eu presidency , and after an evaluation of the risks of a terrorist threat at home conducted by spain 's armed and security forces , " the ministry said in a statement late on tuesday .
the statement also noted the " persistent international terrorist threat " after the alleged attempt to blow up a delta plane headed for detroit on december 25 .
" eta will attempt to prove it is still alive " the move came after interior minister alfredo perez rubalcaba on monday warned that the basque separatist group eta was planning attacks and kidnappings during spain 's upcoming six-month eu presidency .
" eta has been squeezed by the police and justice systems , it 's societally isolated , it 's been put under international pressure , especially by france , and it 's divided internally , " the minister said .
" under these conditions , it can be expected that eta will attempt to prove it is still alive . "
eta is considered a terrorist organization by spain as well as the eu and the us .
the group is held responsible for 828 deaths in the last four decades in their campaign for independent in the basque region of northern spain and southwest france. ai / afp / reuters / dpa editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .

the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .

the program did n't only benefit vw .

that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .
" i am counting on one or two million more cars being sold in our industry than this year , " vw head martin winterkorn said just before christmas . yet winterkorn notes that the smaller profit margins in such markets means revenues will remain low .

according to reports in the guardian newspaper and informationweek.com , karsten nohl , a former graduate student at the university of virginia , and his team of 24 hackers began working on the security codes of the gsm -lrb- global system for mobiles -rrb- system in august .
nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .

nohl revealed his team 's findings at the chaos communication congress in berlin , the largest computer hackers ' conference in europe .
he says that a person with the code and $ 30,000 worth of computer equipment could record phone calls within 15 minutes .
this makes hacking more possible among criminal organizations .
" this shows that existing gsm security is inadequate , " nohl told the congress .
however , the former student insists his work was purely for academic reasons , and that he hoped the global telecommunications industry would improve its security measures .
gsm representatives say research is " highly illegal " nohl 's deciphering of the gsm system did not go down so well with the gsm association , which represents the worldwide mobile communications industry .
" we consider this research , which appears to be motivated in part by commercial considerations , to be a long way from being a practical attack on gsm .
to do this while supposedly being concerned about privacy is beyond me . " said a spokeswoman .
gsm was first developed in 1988 , and prevents the interception of calls by forcing phones and base stations to continually change their frequencies .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .

the program did n't only benefit vw .

that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .
" i am counting on one or two million more cars being sold in our industry than this year , " vw head martin winterkorn said just before christmas . yet winterkorn notes that the smaller profit margins in such markets means revenues will remain low .

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reconciliation credited with release moore was kidnapped by a group called league of the righteous , which is made up of militants formerly loyal to radical cleric muqtada al-sadr .
iraq recently began a reconciliation effort with league of the righteous and other militant groups in an attempt to get them to renounce violence .
" that process of reconciliation has made possible peter moore 's release today , " miliband said .
" i hope it will lead also to the end of the scourge of hostage-taking and violence . "
an iraqi government spokesman also attributed moore 's release to the " government efforts to achieve national reconciliation . " th / afp / ap editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .

" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .
volkswagen also locked in the next two places , with its skoda coming in second and its compact polo coming in third .
the program did n't only benefit vw .
opel announced this week that its sales in germany increased by 31 percent for 2009 compared with 2008 , much of which was attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program how low can they go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers showed they 're willing to buy , if the price is right yet the cash-for-clunkers program , which cost the government about five billion euros , ended in september .
the government announced that it has no plans to renew it .
that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .
" i am counting on one or two million more cars being sold in our industry than this year , " vw head martin winterkorn said just before christmas . yet winterkorn notes that the smaller profit margins in such markets means revenues will remain low .
" that is why 2010 will be a pretty tough year , " he said. th / dpa / apd / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some senior german politicians are considering following suit . the measures are to begin in three weeks time and come in direct response to the attempted bombing of a us passenger plane bound for detroit , which departed from the dutch capital , amsterdam .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ter horst said the scanners would ' likely ' have detected the terror suspect 's bomb dutch interior affairs minister guusje ter horst made the announcement from amsterdam 's schiphol airport where she said security staff would perform full-body searches on all us-bound passengers while the airport 's scanning machines were being correctly calibrated .
ter horst said authorities needed three weeks to " adjust the software of half of schiphol 's 15 full-body scan machines so that the images could be read and interpreted by ... computer , not by humans . "
umar farouk abdulmutallab , a 23-year-old nigerian terrorism suspect , is alleged to have eluded security at schiphol when he boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear on christmas day .
his alleged plan to bomb the flight only failed because the explosives did not detonate . scanners may have made the difference ter horst said normal procedures were observed at schiphol on december 25 , and that regular metal detectors would not have identified the explosives .
she added that full-body scanners would " likely " have prevented the attempted attack , but said it was " impossible to give full guarantees . "
in 2008 , the european parliament blocked the compulsory introduction of full-body scanners because the machines were deemed to compromise personal privacy .
ter horst said schiphol 's efforts to develop software to allow computers to analyze the scanners ' images were aimed at satisfying the parliament 's concerns .
bildunterschrift : some in germany also want to use full-body scanners despite privacy concerns pressure builds for new machines meanwhile , germany 's interior minister thomas de maziere has signaled support for introducing full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at german airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would meet such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " de maiziere said .
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to an intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch want computers to read their machines ' images instead of people privacy concerns germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such machines .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are calling for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the devices .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " in the united states , there has been growing anger over how abdulmutallab was able to board a flight to the us , after it emerged that he had become known to intelligence officials .
president barack obama broke his vacation on hawaii for a second day to say that " systemic failures " had occurred in the country 's intelligence apparatus .
" there was a mix of human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security , " obama said .
" we need to learn from this episode and act quickly to fix the flaws in our system because our security is at stake and lives are at stake . "
obama was told on tuesday that there had been warnings of a possible attack during the christmas period .
he was also told that abdulmutallab was considered a threat by some in the intelligence community , but that this information was not passed on to other branches of the us intelligence services .
" it now appears that weeks ago this information was passed to a component of our intelligence community , but was not effectively distributed so as to get the suspect 's name on a no-fly list , " obama said .
obama has ordered two reports on the incident to be conducted by thursday .
one is to examine how the terrorism suspect eluded security at schiphol airport and the other is to examine why he was not placed on a no-fly list. nw / ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .
museum authorities say they hope to have the sign restored by january to mark the 65th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by the soviet red army. ai / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian striker has had a rocky season with bayern , spending most of his time on the sidelines .
toni , 32 , said he hoped to use the move to regain his place with the italy team for the 2010 world cup .
toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .
the move has not been officially announced , although earlier in the month , bayern president uli hoeness said toni could leave on a free transfer .
in an interview to be published on thursday , hoeness wished toni well at his new club .
" i hope he plays a super second half of the season at as rom and that he shoots a lot of goals , " hoeness told the munich merkur .

coming off his world cup win , toni seemed unstoppable .
he soon became the bundesliga 's top scorer as well as the german league 's best paid player .
his second bundesliga season , while not as stellar , still saw him score 14 goals .
yet toni started his third season out with an injury .
in his absence , bayern 's new coach , louis van gaal , turned to miroslav klose to take on the club 's central striking role with franck ribery and arjen robben lending support .

yet the 2010 sales forecasts look less rosy for volkswagen and other car manufacturers . it has been a bumper year for new car sales in germany with some 3.8 million cars sold .
that 's a 25 percent increase over 2008 , automotive federation vda chief matthias wissmann said wednesday .
germany 's cash-for-clunkers program is credited with keeping consumers buying during the recession .
the car scrapping program paid consumers 2,500 euros -lrb- $ 3,770 -rrb- to trade in an old car for a new one .
and many people traded up for a golf .
the mid-priced , fuel-efficient model was chosen by one of every 10 motorists who took advantage of the government program .
volkswagen also locked in the next two places , with its skoda coming in second and its compact polo coming in third .
the program did n't only benefit vw .
opel announced this week that its sales in germany increased by 31 percent for 2009 compared with 2008 , much of which was attributed to the cash-for-clunkers program how low can they go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german consumers showed they 're willing to buy , if the price is right yet the cash-for-clunkers program , which cost the government about five billion euros , ended in september .
the government announced that it has no plans to renew it .
that makes the prognosis for 2010 “ dreadful , ” according to leading german auto industry expert ferdinand dudenhoeffer . plenty of people pushed up new car purchases to take advantage of the government rebate .
the rest are n't likely to buy unless they are offered deals too good to refuse .
in order to make sales , dealers could drop prices by as much as 20 to 35 percent , nordlb analyst frank schwope told reuters .
but this type of a price drop would decimate profit margins .
and even sharp price decreases probably wo n't be enough to boost sales .
the auto industry expects to sell between 2.75 and 3 million cars in germany next year , germany 's automotive federation has predicted .
dudenhoeffer predicts that volkswagen will see its domestic sales drop by nearly 30 percent while opel will see a 26 percent drop .
all told , he expects sales in germany to decrease by 25.8 percent compared with 2009 .
looking to foreign markets volkswagen expects domestic sales to stagnate next year .
but it hopes to cash in on developing markets such as china , brazil , india and possibly russia .
" i am counting on one or two million more cars being sold in our industry than this year , " vw head martin winterkorn said just before christmas . yet winterkorn notes that the smaller profit margins in such markets means revenues will remain low .
" that is why 2010 will be a pretty tough year , " he said. th / dpa / apd / reuters / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the italian striker has had a rocky season with bayern , spending most of his time on the sidelines .
toni , 32 , said he hoped to use the move to regain his place with the italy team for the 2010 world cup .
toni was one of the stars in italy 's winning 2006 world cup team .
toni also insists roma is the only team he wants to join , despite interest from other clubs in italy and england .

members of sweden 's neo-nazi scene were behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " sign from the auschwitz concentration camp , according to media reports .
poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .
the infamous sign was stolen on december 17 but shortly afterwards it was recovered and five suspects were arrested .
so far , authorities have failed to establish who ordered the theft to be carried out .
polish state prosecutors have confirmed that they are looking for " a man living outside poland , not holding polish citizenship . "
on tuesday , officials in warsaw confirmed that poland was to formally seek the request of sweden in investigating the theft , confirming that polish authorities suspect a swedish link in the crime .
sweden investigates planned neo-nazi attacks polish public television reported that swedish neo-nazis were behind the theft while stockholm 's aftonbladet newspaper wrote that a local neo-nazi group had intended to sell the sign and then use the money for terrorist attacks against swedish government institutions .
a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
some 1.5 million people , mostly jews , died at auschwitz during nazi germany 's occupation of poland .
museum authorities say they hope to have the sign restored by january to mark the 65th anniversary of the camp 's liberation by the soviet red army. ai / dpa / afp editor : susan houlton send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's interior minster says he is in favor of the idea , but he has called for better technology to be implemented . german interior minister thomas de maziere has supported the introduction of full-body scanners - also dubbed ' nude ' scanners - at the country 's airports .
he called , however , for technical improvements and strict regulations to safeguard passengers ' privacy and health .
de maziere told the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper that new models were currently being developed that would live up to such standards .
" i can not yet say whether we will find a solution ... but i think it is worth researching to see whether there is a machine that would protect personal rights , " thomas de maiziere said .
intolerable privacy invasion ?
body scanners generate images of anything hidden under a person 's clothes - including his or her body .
while they could improve airport security , critics say they could amount to intolerable invasion of privacy .
de maziere said that a new generation of the scanners would blur genitals but still pick out any dangerous items hidden under a passenger 's clothes .
bildunterschrift : airport security has been increased following the attempted attack germany 's commissioner for data protection , peter schaar , has spoken out against the use of any such scanners .
" i 'm surprised how quickly people are to call for the scanners , before any of the basic questions related to them have been answered , " he said .
justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger rejects the use of scanners .
" it remains to be seen whether they can be used without infringing upon people 's privacy .
it will depend on the technical progress of these scanners , " she said .
obama : " systemic failure " led to detroit attack calls for the use of body scanners at airports have been on the rise since the attempted terror attack on a detroit-bound plane coming from amsterdam on december 25 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schiphol airport will soon introduce body scanners for passengers to the us us president barak obama on tuesday said there had been " human and systemic failures that contributed to this potential catastrophic breach of security . "
security experts say that a scanner might have detected the explosives the terrorist was hiding when he boarded the plane .
the netherland 's interior minster guusje ter horst announced on wednesday that his country would begin using full-body scanners within three weeks to scan people travelling to the united states .
ter horst said normal procedures had been adhered to at amsterdam 's schiphol airport on christmas day , when 23-year-old nigerian terror suspect umar farouk abdulmutallab is alleged to have boarded a flight to detroit with explosives in his underwear .
the minister added that normal metal detectors would not have identified the explosives , and that full-body scanners may have prevented the attempted attack .
abdulmutallab allegedly smuggled devices on board to build a bomb which he intended to detonate upon landing in detroit .
he was overpowered by the plane 's crew and passengers. ai / dpa / ap / afp editor : chuck penfold send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland has requested help from stockholm in its investigation . polish authorities have formally asked sweden to help track down those behind the theft of the " arbeit macht frei " -lrb- " work will set you free " -rrb- sign at the former nazi concentration camp at auschwitz .

a spokesperson for sweden 's secret police did not confirm those allegations but said that investigations were under way to curb attacks on the country 's parliament , foreign ministry and the private apartment of prime minister fredrik reinfeldt .
the sign was forged by a polish prisoner at auschwitz during the second world war .
its theft sparked widespread outrage , particularly from israel and jewish groups .
