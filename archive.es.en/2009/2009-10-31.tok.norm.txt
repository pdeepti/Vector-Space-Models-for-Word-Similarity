one of these , a 48-year-old woman from bonn , was the first to have succumbed to the flu despite enjoying otherwise good health .
the woman " had no known medical history which would explain such serious illness , " said bonn 's university hospital on friday evening .
where the woman was infected remains unclear .
also dead were a five-year-old boy in the federal state of saarland who was also suffering from pneumonia and , according to a newspaper report , a sixteen-year-old in bavaria who was reportedly severely disabled .
all fatal cases of swine flu in germany had , until friday , been caused by complications associated with other illnesses or conditions .
german authorities fear a surge in cases as the flu and cold season continues .
" there could be a second wave of pandemic influenza beginning in germany , " said director of the institute of hygiene and public health at the university clinic in bonn , martin exner .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .

in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .

a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .

somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .

here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .

" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .
polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .
looking east first the visit to poland comes as something of a surprise , since previous german foreign ministers have generally traveled westward to paris first on their debut trips .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .

the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .

" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .

here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 31.10.2009 pirates demand $ 7 million ransom for british couple großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy is rife in the gulf of aden waters somali pirates issued a $ 7 million dollar ransom demand for a british couple kidnapped over a week ago in the indian ocean . a man who identified himself as one of the pirates holding britons paul and rachel chandler hostage made the demand in a phone call to the bbc on friday .
" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german naval troops are part of the eu 's anti-piracy operation a german frigate is among eu vessels patrolling the lawless gulf of aden waters off somalia as part of the atalanta mission .
piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .
pirates in northern somalia said on saturday they had seized a yemeni fishing vessel after a gunbattle overnight that killed one of the hijackers and wounded another. rb / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 31.10.2009 pirates demand $ 7 million ransom for british couple großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy is rife in the gulf of aden waters somali pirates issued a $ 7 million dollar ransom demand for a british couple kidnapped over a week ago in the indian ocean . a man who identified himself as one of the pirates holding britons paul and rachel chandler hostage made the demand in a phone call to the bbc on friday .
" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .
pirates in northern somalia said on saturday they had seized a yemeni fishing vessel after a gunbattle overnight that killed one of the hijackers and wounded another. rb / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.10.2009 leverkusen cling to top spot despite agonizing draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's vicente sanchez headed the equalizer with two minutes of normal time left bayer leverkusen went one point clear at the top of the bundesliga despite conceding two late goals to draw 2-2 at schalke on saturday .
main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .
polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .
looking east first the visit to poland comes as something of a surprise , since previous german foreign ministers have generally traveled westward to paris first on their debut trips .
but chancellor angela merkel 's new government , sworn in on wednesday , have emphasized the importance of polish-german ties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle took over from his election opponent frank-walter steinmeier last week westerwelle had announced on thursday that he would pay special attention to strengthening relations with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
" this is not by chance .
it shows our desire for good neighborly relations with our eastern neighbor , " westerwelle said .
polish prime minister donald tusk said it was a " very good sign " that westerwelle 's first state visit was to poland .
" poland and germany are well aware that bilateral relations are very good , " tusk said , " we must do all we can to make them even better . "
tusk and westerwelle met in brussels during the eu summit on thursday and friday. sjt / ap / reuters / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .

the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .

the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .

the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .

" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .

other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .

here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .

evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .

" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .

one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "

the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german naval troops are part of the eu 's anti-piracy operation a german frigate is among eu vessels patrolling the lawless gulf of aden waters off somalia as part of the atalanta mission .
piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .

bernhard vogel , president of the konrad adenauer foundation which sponsored the event , praised the former us president .
" you came to our side .
you supported us germans without hesitation , " he said to a grinning bush .
from the fall of the wall to reunificiation vogel also had warm words for the former soviet premier , saying that previous soviet leaders would have sent in the tanks to prevent the collapse of the communist system in germany , but gorbachev did not .
within weeks of the wall 's opening in berlin , the german communist system was finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl went on to lead a reunified germany until 1998 honored , too , was former chancellor helmut kohl , for his role in seizing the opportunity to reunite germany as one nation .
" these three men are great men , " german president horst koehler said at the event , " nations need patriots who also have respect for other nations . "
" i thank you in the name of the germans and , i think i may say , in the name of all the other nations . "
but gorbachev , in recognizing the two other european leaders who were absent , remembered that a reunified germany had not always been seen as a desirable outcome .
former british prime minister margaret thatcher , now 84 and suffering from alzheimer 's disease , and the late french president francois mitterand , had been less than enthusiastic about the prospect .
" thatcher and mitterand and myself , we defended the position that there needed to be two germanys , " gorbachev said .
" i 'm sorry , helmut .
we did n't have good relations at the start . "
calls for " intensive relations " between eu and russia koehler called for european security policies to work more closely with russia , saying that tighter bonds with russia would complement europe 's strong relationship with the us to the west .
he said the time was right for an " intensive dialogue " between the european union and russia .
other former leaders who attended the event included tadeusz mazowiecki , former leader of poland and miklos nemeth , then the prime minister of hungary. sjt / svs / dpa / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german naval troops are part of the eu 's anti-piracy operation a german frigate is among eu vessels patrolling the lawless gulf of aden waters off somalia as part of the atalanta mission .
piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .
pirates in northern somalia said on saturday they had seized a yemeni fishing vessel after a gunbattle overnight that killed one of the hijackers and wounded another. rb / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de piracy -pipe- 31.10.2009 pirates demand $ 7 million ransom for british couple großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piracy is rife in the gulf of aden waters somali pirates issued a $ 7 million dollar ransom demand for a british couple kidnapped over a week ago in the indian ocean . a man who identified himself as one of the pirates holding britons paul and rachel chandler hostage made the demand in a phone call to the bbc on friday .
" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

piracy is rife off the horn of africa nation , which has not had an effective central government since 1991 .
young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .
pirates in northern somalia said on saturday they had seized a yemeni fishing vessel after a gunbattle overnight that killed one of the hijackers and wounded another. rb / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .

polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .

evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .

" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "

the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "

he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .

one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .

" there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much .

" price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .

some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rather than his scoring exploits , the italian striker has been airring his frustrations , considering transfers and laboring in the reserves .

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .

the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .

" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .

one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "

the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .

" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.10.2009 leverkusen cling to top spot despite agonizing draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's vicente sanchez headed the equalizer with two minutes of normal time left bayer leverkusen went one point clear at the top of the bundesliga despite conceding two late goals to draw 2-2 at schalke on saturday .
main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

bernhard vogel , president of the konrad adenauer foundation which sponsored the event , praised the former us president .
" you came to our side .
you supported us germans without hesitation , " he said to a grinning bush .
from the fall of the wall to reunificiation vogel also had warm words for the former soviet premier , saying that previous soviet leaders would have sent in the tanks to prevent the collapse of the communist system in germany , but gorbachev did not .
within weeks of the wall 's opening in berlin , the german communist system was finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl went on to lead a reunified germany until 1998 honored , too , was former chancellor helmut kohl , for his role in seizing the opportunity to reunite germany as one nation .

" i thank you in the name of the germans and , i think i may say , in the name of all the other nations . "
but gorbachev , in recognizing the two other european leaders who were absent , remembered that a reunified germany had not always been seen as a desirable outcome .
former british prime minister margaret thatcher , now 84 and suffering from alzheimer 's disease , and the late french president francois mitterand , had been less than enthusiastic about the prospect .
" thatcher and mitterand and myself , we defended the position that there needed to be two germanys , " gorbachev said .
" i 'm sorry , helmut .
we did n't have good relations at the start . "
calls for " intensive relations " between eu and russia koehler called for european security policies to work more closely with russia , saying that tighter bonds with russia would complement europe 's strong relationship with the us to the west .
he said the time was right for an " intensive dialogue " between the european union and russia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.10.2009 merkel and sarkozy scupper blair 's presidential hopes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair saw his chances crumble at the two-day summit in brussels tony blair will probably not become ' europe 's george washington ' after german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy failed to back the former british prime minister at a summit in brussels . asked if he supported blair , president sarkozy told reporters , " you know very well that the names in the first wave are not necessarily the winners in the final round , " and went on to indicate that angela merkel was also against blair 's candidacy for what could become the most important appointment in the european union .
instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .
polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .
looking east first the visit to poland comes as something of a surprise , since previous german foreign ministers have generally traveled westward to paris first on their debut trips .
but chancellor angela merkel 's new government , sworn in on wednesday , have emphasized the importance of polish-german ties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle took over from his election opponent frank-walter steinmeier last week westerwelle had announced on thursday that he would pay special attention to strengthening relations with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
" this is not by chance .
it shows our desire for good neighborly relations with our eastern neighbor , " westerwelle said .
polish prime minister donald tusk said it was a " very good sign " that westerwelle 's first state visit was to poland .
" poland and germany are well aware that bilateral relations are very good , " tusk said , " we must do all we can to make them even better . "

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bernhard vogel , president of the konrad adenauer foundation which sponsored the event , praised the former us president .
" you came to our side .
you supported us germans without hesitation , " he said to a grinning bush .
from the fall of the wall to reunificiation vogel also had warm words for the former soviet premier , saying that previous soviet leaders would have sent in the tanks to prevent the collapse of the communist system in germany , but gorbachev did not .
within weeks of the wall 's opening in berlin , the german communist system was finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl went on to lead a reunified germany until 1998 honored , too , was former chancellor helmut kohl , for his role in seizing the opportunity to reunite germany as one nation .
" these three men are great men , " german president horst koehler said at the event , " nations need patriots who also have respect for other nations . "
" i thank you in the name of the germans and , i think i may say , in the name of all the other nations . "
but gorbachev , in recognizing the two other european leaders who were absent , remembered that a reunified germany had not always been seen as a desirable outcome .
former british prime minister margaret thatcher , now 84 and suffering from alzheimer 's disease , and the late french president francois mitterand , had been less than enthusiastic about the prospect .
" thatcher and mitterand and myself , we defended the position that there needed to be two germanys , " gorbachev said .
" i 'm sorry , helmut .
we did n't have good relations at the start . "
calls for " intensive relations " between eu and russia koehler called for european security policies to work more closely with russia , saying that tighter bonds with russia would complement europe 's strong relationship with the us to the west .
he said the time was right for an " intensive dialogue " between the european union and russia .
other former leaders who attended the event included tadeusz mazowiecki , former leader of poland and miklos nemeth , then the prime minister of hungary. sjt / svs / dpa / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .

two major arms suppliers , russia and china , refused to support the measure . the united nations resolution calls for talks aimed at agreeing a treaty to police the world 's $ 55-billion -lrb- 37-billion-euro -rrb- arms trade .
the un general assembly 's first committee on disarmament and peace passed the resolution calling for a treaty by 153 votes to one , with 19 abstentions .
the united states , britain and france , which along with germany are major arms suppliers , also supported the move .
the negotiations should address the " problems relating to the unregulated trade in conventional weapons and their diversion to the illicit market , considering that such risks can fuel instability , transnational organized crime and terrorism , and that international action should be taken to address the problem , " the resolution said .
zimbabwe stood alone in its opposition to a treaty on arms regulation , while the 19 countries abstaining included russia , china , india and pakistan .
the treaty would aim to impose stricter export controls on weapons sales to nations that now lack them .
formal talks on the treaty are to begin next year , with the us reversing a bush-era policy that said national controls would be more effective than a global arms regulatory system .
us president barack obama decided to back the treaty providing that the final round of talks , set for 2012 , were run on the basis of consensus , granting countries veto powers .
germany , among other states , was angered by that demand , arguing it would lead to a watered-down treaty .
diplomats said britain had persuaded berlin that us involvement would strengthen the legitimacy of any treaty , as washington controls around two-thirds of the global arms trade. dfm / dpa / reuters editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .
polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .
looking east first the visit to poland comes as something of a surprise , since previous german foreign ministers have generally traveled westward to paris first on their debut trips .
but chancellor angela merkel 's new government , sworn in on wednesday , have emphasized the importance of polish-german ties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle took over from his election opponent frank-walter steinmeier last week westerwelle had announced on thursday that he would pay special attention to strengthening relations with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
" this is not by chance .
it shows our desire for good neighborly relations with our eastern neighbor , " westerwelle said .
polish prime minister donald tusk said it was a " very good sign " that westerwelle 's first state visit was to poland .
" poland and germany are well aware that bilateral relations are very good , " tusk said , " we must do all we can to make them even better . "

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider . " when comparison with similar tourism products does not show a negative price difference , but it does show better quality and a corporate image that cares for the environment ... the tourists ' holiday choice becomes very easy , " she said .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .

" our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 31.10.2009 merkel and sarkozy scupper blair 's presidential hopes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tony blair saw his chances crumble at the two-day summit in brussels tony blair will probably not become ' europe 's george washington ' after german chancellor angela merkel and french president nicolas sarkozy failed to back the former british prime minister at a summit in brussels . asked if he supported blair , president sarkozy told reporters , " you know very well that the names in the first wave are not necessarily the winners in the final round , " and went on to indicate that angela merkel was also against blair 's candidacy for what could become the most important appointment in the european union .
instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we only need a little amount of $ 7 million , " the caller said . " if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
the chandlers , both in their 50s , were seized from their yacht , the lynn rival , on october 23 by armed men .
the yacht was later found abandoned in international waters .
in a phone call to the bbc on friday , the caller , who identified himself as one of the pirates , said : " we only need a little amount of seven million dollars .
if they do not harm us , we will not harm them . "
a foreign office spokesman in london said the british government was aware of the reported ransom demand and but that it could not confirm its authenticity .
the spokesman said the government rejected the ransom demand . " the government is n't going to make any substantive concessions to hostage-takers , and that includes the payment of ransom , " he said .
the chandlers ' family said they were still checking the demand .
somali prime minister omar sharmarke said in london that his government was attempting to make contact with the pirates to explain that the couple did not have so much money .
couple moved ashore media reports also said that the kidnappers had moved the chandlers on shore from a container vessel and that there was a dispute between different groups over the two britons .
the chandlers were kidnapped last friday soon after they set out for tanzania after leaving the seychelles archipelago in the indian ocean .
their kidnappers took them to the somali coast .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somali pirates have seized dozens of vessels over the past couple of years the britons were then moved from their yacht to a large container ship because the pirates feared foreign forces might try and rescue them .
the ransom call came a day after rachel chandler made a tearful phone call to her brother , saying they were coping with the pressure and that their captors had given them food and water .
" please do n't worry about us , we are managing , " she said , according to a recording of the conversation broadcast on britain 's itv news .
pirates blame nato operations the pirate who made the ransom call said the money was partly in compensation for the damage caused by nato-led anti-piracy operations off the somali coast .
" they have destroyed a lot of equipment belonging to the poor local fishermen , " he said .
earlier this year , european union nations decided to extend their anti-piracy naval operation off the coast of somalia by one year .
the extension of operation atlanta allows for ships from eu nations to continue their operations until december 2010 .
voting for the extension in june , the 27-nation bloc said piracy off the somali coast remained a " serious threat " .

young men take to the seas in search of multimillion-dollar ransoms despite the presence of over a dozen international warships .
the pirates have since expanded their operations further out into the indian ocean to avoid the patrols .
in the last few weeks , pirates seized a chinese cargo ship with 25 crew members , a spanish fishing boat with 36 crew onboard and a panamian cargo vessel carrying over two dozen seamen .

the nazi-affiliated arrow cross party took over hungary in the last months of world war ii .
during the regime 's short rule from october 1944 to january 1945 , 80,000 jews were deported to the nazi death camps , while an estimated 20,000 jews were killed outright – hundreds of them in the basement of the building which now houses the museum .
when the communists came to power after the soviets liberated budapest in 1945 , their secret police -lrb- known by the abbreviation avh -rrb- , moved into the former fascist police headquarters .
there , police interrogated , tortured and executed those considered an enemy of the state .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exterior features photos depicting victims of the hungarian state security authority now , visitors can walk through the former interrogation rooms and prison cells , and watch videos of interviews with former detainees as well as old propaganda films – all of which illustrate the horror of living in hungary in these two periods .
evoking the past many people have difficulties imagining what it is like to live under a totalitarian terrorist dictatorship , said maria schmidt , the director-general of the house of terror museum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reconstruction of an office of the hungarian state security authority eingestellt oktober 2009 " people were afraid to say anything which was not dictated by the party , " she said .
" they had to obey orders from the state in every respect , and anybody who was seen by the regime as a threat or an enemy was persecuted . "
perhaps the most chilling part of the museum , which first opened in 2002 , is a series of concrete rooms in the building 's basement , where prisoners were interrogated and tortured .
instead of glass , the windows are lined with bars , and bleak wooden benches with a few blankets strewn over them show where prisoners would have slept – when they had a chance to , that is .
" they were beaten , some of them beaten to death , some of them just beaten very heavily , some of them were brought into cells which were filled of water , some of them just could not sleep for days , " said schmidt .
memorial to suffering bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wall of photos of hungarian political prisoners featuring a giant wall covered with portraits of former detainees , the museum also serves as a memorial to those who suffered within the building .
one such detainee is laszlo regeczy nagy , who was arrested by the avh for aiding the political insurgency against soviet-rule during the 1956 hungarian revolution .
" i spent seven months in solitary confinement and for those long months you would never see anyone other than your guard and your interrogating officer , " he said .
" sealing -lrb- the prisoners -rrb- off from everyday life ... was an effective method of losing contact with reality . "
during this period , nagy was constantly subjected to sleep deprivation , being woken up " many times " during the night .
" we were never allowed to sleep properly , " nagy said .
" so many things happened during the daytime that we needed a sleep , but we could never have one ; and during the day , they always pestered us . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hangman ’ s noose on display the basement also houses the rooms where interrogation and torture took place – there 's a padded cell ; a tiny room with basic wash facilities ; a small confined area about half a square metre in size for locking up those in solitary confinement ; a water torture chamber ; a room for giving electric shocks and an execution chamber where a noose hangs ominously from the ceiling .
the aim of the secret police interrogators was often to torture the detainees into confessing real and imagined crimes .
once they had confessed , the prisoners were then disposable .
" everybody knew that it was very easy to come -lrb- to the avh headquarters -rrb- alive , but much more difficult to leave it alive , " nagy said .
" if you were sentenced to death , then you were simply transferred to a prison and hanged there the next day . "
for former prisoner nagy , the museum has an important role in reminding the present generation of the past .
he also says that for his generation , it 's " exciting " to have access to material which was hidden for half a century .

bernhard vogel , president of the konrad adenauer foundation which sponsored the event , praised the former us president .
" you came to our side .
you supported us germans without hesitation , " he said to a grinning bush .
from the fall of the wall to reunificiation vogel also had warm words for the former soviet premier , saying that previous soviet leaders would have sent in the tanks to prevent the collapse of the communist system in germany , but gorbachev did not .
within weeks of the wall 's opening in berlin , the german communist system was finished .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : helmut kohl went on to lead a reunified germany until 1998 honored , too , was former chancellor helmut kohl , for his role in seizing the opportunity to reunite germany as one nation .
" these three men are great men , " german president horst koehler said at the event , " nations need patriots who also have respect for other nations . "
" i thank you in the name of the germans and , i think i may say , in the name of all the other nations . "
but gorbachev , in recognizing the two other european leaders who were absent , remembered that a reunified germany had not always been seen as a desirable outcome .
former british prime minister margaret thatcher , now 84 and suffering from alzheimer 's disease , and the late french president francois mitterand , had been less than enthusiastic about the prospect .
" thatcher and mitterand and myself , we defended the position that there needed to be two germanys , " gorbachev said .
" i 'm sorry , helmut .
we did n't have good relations at the start . "
calls for " intensive relations " between eu and russia koehler called for european security policies to work more closely with russia , saying that tighter bonds with russia would complement europe 's strong relationship with the us to the west .
he said the time was right for an " intensive dialogue " between the european union and russia .
other former leaders who attended the event included tadeusz mazowiecki , former leader of poland and miklos nemeth , then the prime minister of hungary. sjt / svs / dpa / ap / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this first visit to eastern rather than western europe sets a new tone for the government 's foreign policy . in a bid to strengthen germany 's ties with its eastern neighbors , foreign minister guido westerwelle chose warsaw as the destination of his first official state visit on saturday . following a two-hour meeting with his counterpart radoslaw sikorski , westerwelle said that deepening relations with poland would be one his " core concerns " .
he told journalists after the meeting that a strong friendship between the two countries was not only good for the people of germany and poland , but good for the whole of europe , adding that it was his intention to make the partnership with poland as strong as it is with germany 's western neighbors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle and sikorski underlined the importance of their countries ' partnership to the whole of europe german-polish relations at their strongest ever sikorski received the new foreign minister enthusiastically , saying that relations between germany and poland were currently better than they 'd ever been in history .
polish president lech kaczynski also received westerwelle on saturday afternoon , showing him the room where representatives of poland 's communist regime had negotiated with the democratic opposition in 1989 .
a german diplomat called the mini-tour " a personal gesture " of the president .
kaczynski has previously expressed concern about germany 's dominance in the european union .
looking east first the visit to poland comes as something of a surprise , since previous german foreign ministers have generally traveled westward to paris first on their debut trips .
but chancellor angela merkel 's new government , sworn in on wednesday , have emphasized the importance of polish-german ties .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle took over from his election opponent frank-walter steinmeier last week westerwelle had announced on thursday that he would pay special attention to strengthening relations with germany 's eastern european neighbors .
" this is not by chance .
it shows our desire for good neighborly relations with our eastern neighbor , " westerwelle said .
polish prime minister donald tusk said it was a " very good sign " that westerwelle 's first state visit was to poland .
" poland and germany are well aware that bilateral relations are very good , " tusk said , " we must do all we can to make them even better . "

but at the same time , europe will also experience more extreme weather events like hurricanes , changing precipitation patterns and more forest fires in places like the mediterranean .
that will change vacation opportunities there , said stephanie draper , the director of forum for the future and co-author of the tourism 2023 report . " there are a few things we can really be sure about : climate change , water scarcity and the increase in cost of resources are all things which are going to have a serious impact on the way we go on holiday in the future , " draper told deutsche welle . the report also paints a bleak picture for those holidaymakers who head to warm countries where swimming pools and ice-cold drinks provide cool comfort when the blazing sun gets to be too much . " if 25 percent of the world is exposed to water scarcity , which is the current prediction , that puts a lot of pressure on the holiday product , " draper said . positive change the tourism 2023 report is not all doom and gloom , however . it also proposes answers to the challenges climates changes pose the tourism industry .
it is also hoped that some of the effects of that change will force tourists to rethink their holiday requirements and destinations , and in turn create a better understanding of the impact that their travel arrangements and vacations have on the places they visit . " some places which have been too cold to holiday in during the summer will be warmer so there will be opportunities to holiday more locally , " draper said .
" this will cut down on the impact travel has . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long-haul flights may be replaced by hoildays at home individuals need to be aware of their vacations ' impact on the environment and the local community , she added . " our approach is to think about what you want to get out of a holiday and not automatically book a fortnight-long , long-haul holiday without thinking about local options and overland travel , and then maybe take a long-haul holiday every three years , " she said . staying closer to home is one way individuals can lower their carbon footprint , but they can also offset the greenhouse gasses they do create when travelling , said silvia hendriks of travel oke , an independent sustainable tourism consultancy . " tourists can compensate for co2 emissions by paying a small amount to organizations like greenseat , and limit the amount of waste they produce in destinations , " she said . hendriks also suggested tourists take other smaller steps , like limiting the use of air-conditioners and lights , not changing towels every day , frequenting local restaurants and asking for locally produced organic food . adapting to environmental reality what is certain is that the tourism industry is going to have to make changes to the way it operates in this new reality , something forum for the future 's report addresses in four possible scenarios . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing trends could send tourists to unusual places the " boom and bust " model envisages a world in which new technologies make green travel easier while the " divided disquiet " vision where political instability makes many world destinations unpalatable , except for doomsday tourism , where people flock to see rapidly disappearing natural resources . " price and privilege " looks at a world where rising fuel and energy costs make long-distance travel too expensive for most people , while " carbon clampdown " imagines a tourism market where legislative measures such as personal carbon credits combine with greater education on the risks associated with climate change and lead to reduced demand for international travel . " some of them are dependent on how regulation develops and how technology advances , " draper said . economic survival starts now how the tourism industry approaches these models and adapts to forecasted climatic changes depends on how it emerges from the current global economic crisis .
tourism has been hit hard by the downturn and it remains to be seen how the industry will approach the challenge and costs of restructuring its business . draper said she believes the economic survival of the tourism industry really depends on what it does now . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time will tell if the tourism industry adapts and survives " we 've found that taking a more sustainable approach is the best way to respond to the changes in the industry , " she said . hendriks said she believes that the present economic factors can actually have a positive effect on sustainable tourism in the future . " consumer interest in environmental issues remains high during this economic crisis period , " said hendriks .
" moreover , the individual organizations can reduce their operational costs and improve their corporate image , which is an essential marketing tool in these times of crisis . " price , she added , is a major concern , but not the only one holiday-makers consider .

instead , sarkozy said that he and merkel had agreed to join forces and back the same candidate for the job , and that they shared a vision for both the top posts to be created under the lisbon treaty .
though they apparently have favored runners , sarkozy declined to reveal them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel have agreed to back the same candidate " with angela merkel , we have agreed that france and germany will have a common vision and support the same candidate when the time comes , " sarkozy said .
the failure to back blair will be seen as a snub to britain after prime minister gordon brown campaigned personally for his former government partner this week . sarkozy turns against his old ally sarkozy once declared his support for blair 's candidacy , but the british campaign to push blair stumbled when brown failed to win the blessing of european socialists before the summit began on thursday .
some prominent leaders of the left-wing parliamentary group , allied to blair 's governing labour party , refused their backing because of blair 's close relationship to former us president george w. bush and the leading role he played in the war in iraq .
" if he can not get the backing of the socialist group , being a labour man himself , it 's a very difficult situation , " danish prime minister lars lokke rasmussen said .
appointing blair would also have been difficult for germany and france because britain is not among the 16 countries that use the euro currency and the island nation is seen as euroskeptic .
no favorites the decision leaves the race for the eu candidacy open , though leaders are likely to choose a center-right candidate , as europe is currently dominated by conservative leaders .
dutch prime minister jan peter balkenende said on friday he would not rule himself out if pushed into a bid by others .
" if others are asking , then you are a candidate , " he said .
other possibilities could include luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker , finnish premier paavo lipponen and former belgian premier guy verhofstadt .
bildunterschrift : british foreign minister david milliband , left , could become europe 's foreign policy chief sarkozy said that a summit of eu leaders is scheduled for mid-november to discuss possible candidates .
but the job description remains vague , as the lisbon treaty is yet to come into force and it contains few details about what it entails and what powers should be attached to it .
british foreign minister for europe as well as a president , the eu is searching for a foreign policy chief to raise the bloc 's influence on the world stage .
here eu members want to strike a careful balance between someone with enough political weight to have credibility in meetings with the united states or china , and yet enough sensitivity not to sideline europe 's political leaders .
ironically , the name most frequently being attached to this post is that of another british labour party politician - current foreign minister david milliband .
milliband this week declared himself " unavailable " for the post , but recent remarks suggesting europe should play a bigger global role have been interpreted as a sign that the position holds genuine appeal. bk / reuters / afp editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 31.10.2009 leverkusen cling to top spot despite agonizing draw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's vicente sanchez headed the equalizer with two minutes of normal time left bayer leverkusen went one point clear at the top of the bundesliga despite conceding two late goals to draw 2-2 at schalke on saturday .
main rivals hamburg , bayern munich and bremen failed to capitalize on the slip . none of the first five teams in germany 's top soccer league managed to gather all three points on saturday , as the bundesliga stayed tight on its eleventh match day .
first-placed leverkusen will feel most frustrated as they conceded two goals in the last ten minutes of their game against local rivals schalke , currently in fourth place .
leverkusen dominated their hosts in the first half and toni kroos struck after 29 minutes , firing an unstoppable volley from 18 metres past keeper manuel neuer .
stefan kiessling doubled the lead in the 44th minute when he headed in a tranquillo barnetta cross for his seventh league goal of the season .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : munich 's miroslav klose did n't have it in him today but they could only hold onto that lead to the 88th minute , when vicente sanchez 's header completed schalke 's comeback , five minutes after kevin kuranyi had pulled the home team back into the game .
hamburg finally beaten but the league 's only other unbeaten side , the seemingly unstoppable hamburg sv could not take advantage of leverkusen 's agony , letting lowly borussia moenchengladbach get the better of them in a thriller on their home ground .
moenchengladbach showed uncharacteristic determination to twice come from behind , before scoring a late winner through canadian rob friend to break hamburg 's record and leave them in third spot on 22 points .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's aaron hunt scored two to get his team level in the dying minutes werder bremen , meanwhile , were also stopped by a bottom-half side , drawing 2-2 with 16th-placed nuremberg .
the pain of missing the chance to overtake leverkusen will only be slightly mitigated by the euphoria of a stoppage time equalizer that gave them a precious point .
like schalke they can also count themselves fortunate to turn over a 2-0 half-time deficit .
bayern fail to bite bayern munich continued their recent toothless form by allowing struggling stuttgart to end their five-match losing streak .
the fifth-placed bavarians drew 0-0 at vfb stuttgart , who perhaps did enough to offer coach markus babbel some respite .
stuttgart set a frantic early pace against bayern , stretching keeper hans-joerg butt twice with shots from julian schieber and christian traesch .
bayern 's anatoliy tymoshchuk tried several long range efforts but neither miroslav klose nor former stuttgart striker mario gomez , making a rare start for the bavarians , could carve out a good chance .
coach louis van gaal brought on striker luca toni for klose in the second half and the italian made an immediate impact , twice going close .
toni put the ball in the net four minutes from time but was ruled offside .
" i think we had more possession but did not create many chances so in a way i am satisfied , " concluded van gaal. bk / reuters / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

democracy , war crimes , terrorism - regardless of the issue , the west is accused of not playing fair .
but is absolute moral consistency possible or even desirable ?
deutsche welle asked an ethics expert for advice . in a recent essay in germany 's sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , egyptian author alaa al-aswani eloquently drew attention to the fact that when western governments and media talk about democracy in the muslim world , that 's not exactly what they mean . why , al-aswani asked , was the west so eager to criticize irregularities in this summer 's elections in iran when no one in the west protests about electoral manipulations in his country ? " the answer is that the cries of injustice are not raised to promote democracy , " al aswani wrote . " they were aimed solely at discrediting an iranian regime that is hostile to israel and is trying to develop nuclear weapons .
the egyptian government may be despotic and corrupt , but it 's compliant and tame … so western media are happy to ignore its flaws . " it 's no secret that the west , to paraphrase george orwell , views some democracies as more equal than others .
is this an instance of crass hypocrisy , or does it merely reflect the realpolitik of international relations ? " western democracy is based on and can not be understood without christian humanist values , " said stephan holthaus , the director of the institute for ethics and values at the giessen school of theology . " so-called democracies in the middle east are often based on a different foundation and have a different history , culture and religion in the background .
we use the same concepts but fail to understand one another because the basic value systems are quite different . " the fog of war democracy is , of course , an abstract concept particularly open to definition and interpretation .
concrete rules - for instance , those applying to the conduct of war - should be easier to apply consistently .
but are they ? the un , for instance , commissioned the recently released goldstone report to investigate allegations of human rights abuses during israel 's military incursion into the gaza strip last winter .
the study found that not only hamas , but the israeli military were guilty of serious violation of international law , including targeting civilians . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what for palestinians is wanton destruction is self-defense for many israelis but no sooner was the report out than it engendered further controversy and confusion .
critics of israel seized on it as evidence that the west turns a blind eye when israel commits the sorts of abuses that western leaders condemn when carried out by palestinians . proponents for israel , however , accused the study of wilfully ignoring evidence of hamas fighters disguising themselves as civilians and using civilian facilities as well as the fact that israel had repeatedly asked the un to intervene to stop palestinian rocket attacks on its civilians . in an article for israel 's ha 'aretz newspaper last month , leading commentator ari shavit even argued that the us would be guilty of war crimes in iraq and afghanistan if held to the standard goldstone used for israel . can and should the west be absolutely strict about what is and is n't a war crime ? " here , too , cultural difference plays a huge role , " holthaus said . " what one person sees as a war crime is for another a pure and legitimate act of self-defense .
what we need is a common ethics that applies to all cultures .
and the decisive question is not : who 's right ? - but rather : how do we create lasting peace and reconciliation ? " tangled up in terrorism at least in terms of the unequal power of the combatants , russia 's conflict with georgia last year is comparable to the israeli campaign against hamas .
yet western leaders were quick to condemn moscow for using excessive force . on the other hand , they largely ignore the kremlin 's often bloody campaign against separatists in chechnya , treating it as an internal matter and citing russia 's need to fight terrorists -lrb- the situation is comparable to sri lanka 's battle against tamil tiger rebels -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's difficult to compare conflicts like the one in georgia , yet comparisons are made constantly moreover , under former president george w. bush , the us itself used practices many people consider to be torture as a weapon against a perceived enemy . so is fighting terrorism something like a moral trump card that overrides customary ethical limits ? " we distinguish between ethics , which are timeless , and morality , which is very temporal , " holthaus said .
" basic convictions have to be adapted to concrete situations , but primary values like freedom , equality and solidarity should never be undermined , not even in the seemingly noble cause of fighting terrorism . " practical idealism given the perhaps irreconcilable moral ambiguities that attend nearly all of the world 's major conflicts , one possible response for the west would be to drop all ethical concerns from foreign policy . in other words , western nations could simply declare that results , and not standards of justice or fairness , are the goal in their dealings with other countries and cultures , and admit that they treat allies differently than perceived enemies . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the west needs to strike a balance between morality and pragmatism philosophers often refer to that outlook as " realistic . "
but arguments can be made for the alternative usually known as " practical idealism . "
in that view , ethical standards are very much in the interest of individual nations since they promote concrete goals like peace and stability . and they have a long , if often forgotten history " we need politicians who represent a clear ethical standpoint and have a high degree of sensitivity for other cultures , " holthaus told deutsche welle . " but many politicians in the western world no longer know their own ethical roots .
we should do our homework first before confronting other cultures with our values .
it 's well worth remembering the venerable values of the western world . " perhaps the key , then , is not ethical strictness , but awareness of and the ability to communicate the complex set of values that determine different responses to seemingly similar moral situations . author : jefferson chase editor : rob mudge send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
