music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .
the resulting repetition of his program was the cause of some controversy , but few minded when he could make any composition of robert schumann sound as though it was the best music ever written . according to marc gegenfurtner , finding a successor who will be able to live up to christian thielemann 's ability , and match the orchestra 's considerable ambitions , will be one of the toughest challenges for the city of munich . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen / nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" but we can have contacts with people in other countries whose language we ca n't speak .
esperanto acts as a bridge to other cultures . " some esperantists are no longer focusing on zamenhof 's original goal of world peace , instead seeing the language , and a culture that has grown up around it , as ends in themselves . literary works such as hemingway 's " the old man and the sea " and günter grass ' " tin drum " have been translated into the language .
polish international broadcasting and vatican radio have esperanto services and more than 100 magazines and journals are published in the language , according to the uea . esperanto versions of plays by shakespeare and ionesco have been staged and several movies , including the 1965 cult horror flick " incubus , " starring a pre-star trek william shatner , have had all-esperanto dialog . minority group despite that , esperanto remains something of a fringe phenomenon and , despite the successes that promoters of the language point to , the fact remains that , more than a century after its creation , the community of esperanto speakers is tiny compared to the world population .
estimates of the number of esperanto speakers vary from several hundred thousand to two million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89th esperanto conference was in beijing regarding zamenhof 's goals , he might be pleased to see that , in the 21st century , an international language has established itself .
but he likely would n't be as happy to learn that it is not his own created tongue , but english . " while the number of esperantists has remained fairly constant , the population of the world has grown by leaps and bounds .
so you could say there are fewer esperanto speakers today , " said the uae 's mccoy .
" it 's disappointing that esperanto has not grown . " however , he 's more upbeat when talking about the conference , which he describes as a " jolly week " of esperanto-speaking with people from all over the globe discussing everything from african culture to gay esperantists to literature and poetry , music and film .
he says the death of esperanto has been predicted before , but he is n't worried . " it 's sturdy , like a weed , " he said .

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .

they 're out to brighten up a festival that has a rather dark past . the winds have changed in bayreuth - and this new wind is conspicuously tall , blond and good-looking .
thirty-one-year-old katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner , has taken over from her father wolfgang after his more than half-century reign as festival director . once again , the green hill will stage a great show - even before the curtain opens .
every year , the arrival of the rich , famous and powerful is the true highlight of opening night . but bayreuth 's celebrity opera-goers do n't just add to the luster of it all - they are also representative of the dilemma that the festival finds itself in .
after all , prior to the second world war , bayreuth 's most prominent guest was adolf hitler .
he was a passionate wagnerian and good friend of the wagner family . hitler connection casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , pictured with her husband joachim sauer , attends the festival every year many books have been written about whether richard wagner , who died in 1883 , was a kind of forerunner to the nazis and their inhuman ideology .
a decisive conclusion has not been reached . that wagner was an anti-semite is undisputed , however .
he made that clear in his infamous article " judaism in music , " written in 1850 . the direction of the bayreuth festival has been in the hands of wagner 's descendents since it was founded in 1876 .
in 1930 , the composer 's daughter-in-law winifred wagner - an adamant national socialist - took over the management of the festival . she had been a member of the nazi party since 1926 and had a particularly close relationship with hitler .
a decade before he became chancellor of germany , winifred introduced him to the wagner family .
hitler became a regular guest both at their private home and at the festival concert hall on the green hill . long after the dissolution of the third reich and hitler 's death , winifred wagner still held the fuehrer in high regard .
thirty years after the end of the war , she said in an interview with film director juergen syberberg that she saw hitler as a friend and would be pleased if he were to walk through the door . covering up the embarrassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winifred wagner and adolf hitler are pictured in 1934 naturally , her comments caused a stir and her sons wieland and wolfgang strove to limit the damage to the wagner family 's reputation by playing down the embarrassing remarks as those of a senile old woman . wieland said publically that his mother " still believed in the endsieg " - the ultimate victory of nazi germany - and could n't be taken seriously . nevertheless , even to this day the bayreuth festival is haunted by its one-time connection to hitler and the nazi party , particularly because wieland and wolfgang relied on other people to clear the air and work through the family 's " brown " history . the jury is still out on the family 's willingness to approach the matter critically : while some wagner researchers complain they were n't supported by the family , others say they were given a free hand to research as they liked . clock is ticking for glamorous katharina in 1951 , wieland and wolfgang took over joint leadership of the festival , which they managed to resuscitate both artistically and financially after the war .
after wieland 's death in 1966 , wolfgang continued the work alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival hall in bayreuth is known as the " green hill " now wolfgang 's two daughters are following in his footsteps .
it 's katharina wagner who has taken the spotlight on the green hill - because she 's not only young , but also good-looking .
the glamour she brings to the festival is n't overlooked by journalists , and even serious publications discuss her appearance at great length . even in their first year at the helm , katharina and eva have already made some changes , including a live-stream internet broadcast of the performance of " tristan und isolde " and a children 's version of " der fliegende hollaender . " it remains to be seen whether the changing winds have put bayreuth permanently on a new course .
but katharina and eva do n't have that much time to rig the sails : all of their predecessors , from their father and uncle to their great-grand-father and his widow , had the job for life .

thirty-one-year-old katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner , has taken over from her father wolfgang after his more than half-century reign as festival director . once again , the green hill will stage a great show - even before the curtain opens .
every year , the arrival of the rich , famous and powerful is the true highlight of opening night . but bayreuth 's celebrity opera-goers do n't just add to the luster of it all - they are also representative of the dilemma that the festival finds itself in .
after all , prior to the second world war , bayreuth 's most prominent guest was adolf hitler .
he was a passionate wagnerian and good friend of the wagner family . hitler connection casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , pictured with her husband joachim sauer , attends the festival every year many books have been written about whether richard wagner , who died in 1883 , was a kind of forerunner to the nazis and their inhuman ideology .
a decisive conclusion has not been reached . that wagner was an anti-semite is undisputed , however .
he made that clear in his infamous article " judaism in music , " written in 1850 . the direction of the bayreuth festival has been in the hands of wagner 's descendents since it was founded in 1876 .
in 1930 , the composer 's daughter-in-law winifred wagner - an adamant national socialist - took over the management of the festival . she had been a member of the nazi party since 1926 and had a particularly close relationship with hitler .
a decade before he became chancellor of germany , winifred introduced him to the wagner family .
hitler became a regular guest both at their private home and at the festival concert hall on the green hill . long after the dissolution of the third reich and hitler 's death , winifred wagner still held the fuehrer in high regard .
thirty years after the end of the war , she said in an interview with film director juergen syberberg that she saw hitler as a friend and would be pleased if he were to walk through the door . covering up the embarrassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winifred wagner and adolf hitler are pictured in 1934 naturally , her comments caused a stir and her sons wieland and wolfgang strove to limit the damage to the wagner family 's reputation by playing down the embarrassing remarks as those of a senile old woman . wieland said publically that his mother " still believed in the endsieg " - the ultimate victory of nazi germany - and could n't be taken seriously . nevertheless , even to this day the bayreuth festival is haunted by its one-time connection to hitler and the nazi party , particularly because wieland and wolfgang relied on other people to clear the air and work through the family 's " brown " history . the jury is still out on the family 's willingness to approach the matter critically : while some wagner researchers complain they were n't supported by the family , others say they were given a free hand to research as they liked . clock is ticking for glamorous katharina in 1951 , wieland and wolfgang took over joint leadership of the festival , which they managed to resuscitate both artistically and financially after the war .
after wieland 's death in 1966 , wolfgang continued the work alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival hall in bayreuth is known as the " green hill " now wolfgang 's two daughters are following in his footsteps .
it 's katharina wagner who has taken the spotlight on the green hill - because she 's not only young , but also good-looking .
the glamour she brings to the festival is n't overlooked by journalists , and even serious publications discuss her appearance at great length . even in their first year at the helm , katharina and eva have already made some changes , including a live-stream internet broadcast of the performance of " tristan und isolde " and a children 's version of " der fliegende hollaender . " it remains to be seen whether the changing winds have put bayreuth permanently on a new course .
but katharina and eva do n't have that much time to rig the sails : all of their predecessors , from their father and uncle to their great-grand-father and his widow , had the job for life .

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .

it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .

it has n't done that , although a core group stays true to the ideal . while the constructed language esperanto has not become the global second tongue that its founder ludwik lejzer zamenhof once had hoped , it is making conversation a snap for those gathering in bialystok , poland , for a week-long conference centered on all things esperanto and on keeping zamenhof 's life work alive . seen as unrealistic utopians by some , conference attendees and other esperantists around the globe refuse to give up on the language first presented in a book in 1877 that was thought to be so simple and logical , it would spread like wildfire .
that did not happen , although supporters say zamenhof 's dream , on the 150th anniversary of his birth , of easy communication and international friendship through his language has indeed been realized . that would seem apparent at the 94th world congress of esperanto .
despite coming from around the globe and speaking a variety of native tongues , the 2,000 or so conference delegates will be able to hold complex conversations on a variety of issues thanks to esperanto 's simple grammar and flexible word construction .
that is something many probably could not do if they used the de facto global tongue , english . " -lrb- global english -rrb- is a sort of a language for checking into your hotel room and ordering a meal in a restaurant , " said roy mccoy of the universal esperanto association -lrb- uae -rrb- in rotterdam .

" in esperanto , they can . " " one who hopes " zamenhof was a jewish ophthalmologist from bialystok , poland , where four languages were spoken .

for that to happen , the language had to be simple , so he stripped away maddening irregularities so common in natural languages , and created an easy-to-learn grammar . the vocabulary of about 900 roots , based on indo-european languages , could be expanded into tens of thousands of words through the addition of prefixes and suffixes or making compounds . the goal was to allow learners to achieve fluency in a short period of time .
mccoy of the uae was fluent in esperanto after nine months , although he says he still has problems with dutch , even though he has lived in the netherlands for more than two decades . even playing field in berlin , a crowd of about forty people gathered one thursday afternoon for a ceremony to rename a small neighborhood park after zamenhof .
as the multinational group chatted , there was no stumbling as there would be if some had to plow their way through a foreign language to talk to a native speaker .

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .
massa lost control of his car and ploughed into a tyre wall , after a piece of flying debris hit his helmet .
ferrari said in a statement that the outcome of the surgery was positive and that massa would remain under observation in intensive care .
he is said to be in a serious but stable condition .
the flying debris is believed to have come from the car of fellow brazilian rubens barrichello .
he visited massa in hospital , saying he wanted to be there because he had been in similar situations himself .
the accident follows the death of briton henry surtees , who was killed at britain 's brands hatch circuit last weekend when he was struck by a flying wheel .
barrichello said the two accidents showed that there was a need for improved safety in motorsport .
" i honestly do n't believe in coincidence in life , " he said .
" things happen for a reason and i think this is the second message . "
mclaren 's lewis hamilton also told reporters that he did not believe the two incidents were coincidental .
" we ca n't ignore it , " he said .
" we 've got to make sure we learn from it and improve if we can . "

" this is a special circuit for me because i had my first win here in 2003 , " alonso said .
" i am always happy when i drive in budapest . "

" that was the hardest 25 kilometers , i ever swam , " said maurer .
the outcome of the race came down to a sprint in the last 500 meters there was a three way tie between maurer , russian swimmer anna uvarova and italy 's federica vitale .
but maurer had a little something extra and pulled away by a couple of lengths to grab the gold .
the battle then became one for silver , with russia 's uvarova reaching out her arm and touching the board just ahead of vitale , who had to settle for bronze .
perhaps the greatest compliment for mauerer came from fellow german thomas lurz , himself a double gold winner in the 5km and 10km open water races .
" angela is simply tops , " said lurz .
" this is a huge achievement . "
in the men 's 25 km open water race , italy 's valerio cleri nabbed the gold , making up for his loss in the 10k. av / dpa / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .

the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .
the final touches to the takeover are to be worked out in the coming months .
focus said vw finance experts are to comb through porsche 's balance sheets over the coming days and then determine the purchasing price for the luxury brand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , porsche will be in vw 's stable of brands volkswagen already controls a whole host of car brands ranging from swedish heavy truck maker scania to sports car manufacturers including bugatti and lamborghini which sit alongside the luxury bentley and high-end audi names .

" that was the hardest 25 kilometers , i ever swam , " said maurer .
the outcome of the race came down to a sprint in the last 500 meters there was a three way tie between maurer , russian swimmer anna uvarova and italy 's federica vitale .
but maurer had a little something extra and pulled away by a couple of lengths to grab the gold .
the battle then became one for silver , with russia 's uvarova reaching out her arm and touching the board just ahead of vitale , who had to settle for bronze .
perhaps the greatest compliment for mauerer came from fellow german thomas lurz , himself a double gold winner in the 5km and 10km open water races .
" angela is simply tops , " said lurz .
" this is a huge achievement . "

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan -lrb- l -rrb- and angela merkel support lengthening the lives of germany 's nuclear reactors schavan supports the cdu 's proposal to lengthen the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants and has demanded that more research be done in the area of atomic energy .
the green party , on the other hand , sees the recent incidents and shutdowns as a justification of their anti-nuclear stance .
the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , called the plan supported by the cdu and the free democrats to keep the plants open " irresponsible . "
emergency shutdown the statements came a day after two nuclear power plants in germany were disabled due to irregularities , including one in the northwestern town of lingen , where an emergency shutdown was automatically initiated following an incident in one of the generators .
according to the environment ministry of the german state of lower saxony , where lingen is located , it was only a small incident and no radioactive material was released .
rwe , the plant 's operator , said that all safety devices worked perfectly and that a monitoring device had shut off a tap changer to protect a transformer from being damaged .
rwe added that the appropriate authorities had been informed and that experts from the nuclear regulatory board and technical control board inspected the plant .
it is unclear when the plant will be back up and running .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident at the philippsburg plant was less serious , according to plant operators the plant 's operator , energie baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- , said the step was taken during a search for a possible defect in one of the generator transformers .
the 1400 megawatt reactor in lingen began operation in 1988 and , according to data provided by rwe , produces 11 billion kilowatt hours of electricity every year , powering 3.5 million households .
the philippsburg nuclear reactor was built in the 1970s .
the first unit , with a boiling water reactor , went online in 1979 with the second unit , a pressurized water reactor , following five years later .
together the two sections provide a quarter of the electricity needs of the 10 million people living in the state of baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ajc has said it found as many as 50 right-wing extremist books listed in the online catalog of amazon.de , some of which are classified by the german authorities as unsuitable for people under 18 .
one of the books available was for instance " der auschwitz-mythos – legende oder wirklichkeit " -lrb- " the auschwitz myth – legend or reality " -rrb- by wilhelm staglich .
" it is unacceptable that books are for sale on amazon.de , that normally are only available under the counter in far-right extremist shops , " the committee said in a statement .
the ajc also accused amazon.de of posting ads on google leading internet users who enter searches for the names of right-wing authors to the amazon.de web site .
" we can not let the spread of internet sales erode laws that ban holocaust denial and incitement to hatred of minorities in germany , " the statement added .

juergen schilling , a resident of berlin , was one of those who went to the protest on saturday – the first time he had attended a demonstration since the fall of the berlin wall .
he sent updates and photos of the protest via the internet website twitter - the same site used by iranians to tell the world about the violence in their country .
in an interview with deutsche welle , schilling said he was impressed by the vast array of people at the protest in berlin : from young to old , from all sides of the political spectrum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schilling sent this picture around the world on his twitter account " this goes beyond the political , " he told deutsche welle afterwards .

day of action protests were also held in more than half a dozen locations in germany .
they were part of a worldwide day of activities which took place in more than 80 cities across the globe .
human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch backed the day and sent representatives along to the protests .
ruth juettner , from the german chapter of amnesty international , told deutsche welle that the goal was to show support for the protection of human rights in iran .
" it 's about showing that … the fundamental right to freedom of opinion , the right to assemble , and freedom of the press are valued . "
several iranians in berlin had begun a hunger strike on friday , which they intend to continue until sunday .

in a statement , the opposition leaders accused iranian authorities of " savagery , " and also expressed concern for the mental wellbeing of those detained .

the demonstrations coincided with reports that a protester had died in custody in iran . in berlin , former political prisoners and other iranians in exile joined locals in the center of the german capital to support the opposition protestors in iran .
alongside political speeches , persian poems were read out , and white roses were laid on the ground to remember those killed during the iranian government 's crackdown .
juergen schilling , a resident of berlin , was one of those who went to the protest on saturday – the first time he had attended a demonstration since the fall of the berlin wall .
he sent updates and photos of the protest via the internet website twitter - the same site used by iranians to tell the world about the violence in their country .
in an interview with deutsche welle , schilling said he was impressed by the vast array of people at the protest in berlin : from young to old , from all sides of the political spectrum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schilling sent this picture around the world on his twitter account " this goes beyond the political , " he told deutsche welle afterwards .
" this is really about letting humanity - compassion for your fellow citizens - be felt and lived . "
day of action protests were also held in more than half a dozen locations in germany .
they were part of a worldwide day of activities which took place in more than 80 cities across the globe .
human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch backed the day and sent representatives along to the protests .
ruth juettner , from the german chapter of amnesty international , told deutsche welle that the goal was to show support for the protection of human rights in iran .
" it 's about showing that … the fundamental right to freedom of opinion , the right to assemble , and freedom of the press are valued . "
several iranians in berlin had begun a hunger strike on friday , which they intend to continue until sunday .
the hunger strikers called on world governments not to recognize the re-election of ahmadinejad and to put " human rights ahead of economics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests took place across europe , like here in prague death in custody in iran the worldwide demonstrations coincided with reports from iran that a protestor had died while in detention .
the young man was reportedly the son of an advisor to iranian opposition leader mir hossein mousavi .
on saturday , mousavi and other opposition leaders called on iran 's top clerics to stop the " oppression " carried out by iranian authorities , and help secure the release of detained protesters .
in a statement , the opposition leaders accused iranian authorities of " savagery , " and also expressed concern for the mental wellbeing of those detained .
human rights groups believe hundreds of people have been arrested since the presidential election was held on june 12 .

thousands of stall owners , including many chinese , have had their wares confiscated , prompting a high-level protest from beijing . police cited health and fire safety violations in shutting down the 740-acre -lrb- nearly 300-hectare -rrb- bazaar in northeast moscow .
over 100,000 traders were locked out of their stalls and thrown out of work overnight .
since then , officials have accused the market of being a major hub for smuggling activities and have seized the merchants ' wares , demanding documents to prove that they were legally imported .
many of the traders at the cherkizovsky market are migrants .
some are from the caucasus region to russia 's south and others come from the former soviet republics .
but a significant number are chinese , and it was on their behalf that beijing sent a special delegation headed by deputy commerce minister gao hucheng to moscow this week to protest russia 's actions .
" in light of the development of the sino-russian strategic partnership , china urges the russian side to take a historical perspective , legally resolve the situation and protect chinese merchants ' legal rights , " gao said in a statement on friday .
widespread criticism in the chinese media had described the russian treatment of the migrant workers as unfair and illegal .

the ajc has said it found as many as 50 right-wing extremist books listed in the online catalog of amazon.de , some of which are classified by the german authorities as unsuitable for people under 18 .
one of the books available was for instance " der auschwitz-mythos – legende oder wirklichkeit " -lrb- " the auschwitz myth – legend or reality " -rrb- by wilhelm staglich .
" it is unacceptable that books are for sale on amazon.de , that normally are only available under the counter in far-right extremist shops , " the committee said in a statement .
the ajc also accused amazon.de of posting ads on google leading internet users who enter searches for the names of right-wing authors to the amazon.de web site .
" we can not let the spread of internet sales erode laws that ban holocaust denial and incitement to hatred of minorities in germany , " the statement added .
amazon.de denial amazon.de said the company had recently tightened its internal rules over books that glorify or trivialize the nazis , but said there were no immediate plans to remove any books from its online offering .
" we believe that the correct answer to controversial literature is not to ban it , but to engage in discussion over the controversy , " a spokeswoman for amazon.de said .
she added that in the future there would be books on offer which contained " questionable content with regards to the nazis , " but stressed that none of the books in question were restricted or banned in germany. ai / ap / afp / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .
massa lost control of his car and ploughed into a tyre wall , after a piece of flying debris hit his helmet .
ferrari said in a statement that the outcome of the surgery was positive and that massa would remain under observation in intensive care .
he is said to be in a serious but stable condition .
the flying debris is believed to have come from the car of fellow brazilian rubens barrichello .
he visited massa in hospital , saying he wanted to be there because he had been in similar situations himself .
the accident follows the death of briton henry surtees , who was killed at britain 's brands hatch circuit last weekend when he was struck by a flying wheel .
barrichello said the two accidents showed that there was a need for improved safety in motorsport .
" i honestly do n't believe in coincidence in life , " he said .
" things happen for a reason and i think this is the second message . "
mclaren 's lewis hamilton also told reporters that he did not believe the two incidents were coincidental .
" we ca n't ignore it , " he said .
" we 've got to make sure we learn from it and improve if we can . "

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .
massa lost control of his car and ploughed into a tyre wall , after a piece of flying debris hit his helmet .

" that was the hardest 25 kilometers , i ever swam , " said maurer .
the outcome of the race came down to a sprint in the last 500 meters there was a three way tie between maurer , russian swimmer anna uvarova and italy 's federica vitale .
but maurer had a little something extra and pulled away by a couple of lengths to grab the gold .
the battle then became one for silver , with russia 's uvarova reaching out her arm and touching the board just ahead of vitale , who had to settle for bronze .
perhaps the greatest compliment for mauerer came from fellow german thomas lurz , himself a double gold winner in the 5km and 10km open water races .
" angela is simply tops , " said lurz .
" this is a huge achievement . "
in the men 's 25 km open water race , italy 's valerio cleri nabbed the gold , making up for his loss in the 10k. av / dpa / reuters editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

juergen schilling , a resident of berlin , was one of those who went to the protest on saturday – the first time he had attended a demonstration since the fall of the berlin wall .
he sent updates and photos of the protest via the internet website twitter - the same site used by iranians to tell the world about the violence in their country .
in an interview with deutsche welle , schilling said he was impressed by the vast array of people at the protest in berlin : from young to old , from all sides of the political spectrum .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schilling sent this picture around the world on his twitter account " this goes beyond the political , " he told deutsche welle afterwards .
" this is really about letting humanity - compassion for your fellow citizens - be felt and lived . "
day of action protests were also held in more than half a dozen locations in germany .
they were part of a worldwide day of activities which took place in more than 80 cities across the globe .
human rights groups such as amnesty international and human rights watch backed the day and sent representatives along to the protests .
ruth juettner , from the german chapter of amnesty international , told deutsche welle that the goal was to show support for the protection of human rights in iran .
" it 's about showing that … the fundamental right to freedom of opinion , the right to assemble , and freedom of the press are valued . "
several iranians in berlin had begun a hunger strike on friday , which they intend to continue until sunday .
the hunger strikers called on world governments not to recognize the re-election of ahmadinejad and to put " human rights ahead of economics . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protests took place across europe , like here in prague death in custody in iran the worldwide demonstrations coincided with reports from iran that a protestor had died while in detention .
the young man was reportedly the son of an advisor to iranian opposition leader mir hossein mousavi .
on saturday , mousavi and other opposition leaders called on iran 's top clerics to stop the " oppression " carried out by iranian authorities , and help secure the release of detained protesters .
in a statement , the opposition leaders accused iranian authorities of " savagery , " and also expressed concern for the mental wellbeing of those detained .
human rights groups believe hundreds of people have been arrested since the presidential election was held on june 12 .

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .
the final touches to the takeover are to be worked out in the coming months .
focus said vw finance experts are to comb through porsche 's balance sheets over the coming days and then determine the purchasing price for the luxury brand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , porsche will be in vw 's stable of brands volkswagen already controls a whole host of car brands ranging from swedish heavy truck maker scania to sports car manufacturers including bugatti and lamborghini which sit alongside the luxury bentley and high-end audi names .
most vw sales , however , come from its bread-and-butter golf and polo models , together with czech carmaker skoda and spain 's seat .
porsche and vw employ almost 378,000 , including 12,800 at porsche , with almost half the total based in germany .
vw law re-examination the merger between vw and porsche will mean that the so-called " volkswagen law " would then also apply to porsche .
the controversial law grants the german state of lower saxony a blocking minority in vw , which is based in the city of wolfsburg .
the legislation dates back to the 1960s , and was designed to protect the automaker against hostile takeovers .
the law has long been under scrutiny from the eu , which sees it as protectionist and infringing on the free flow of capital .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the eu commission with jurisdiction over internal markets and services is currently debating whether to take the matter to the eu court of justice for a second time. ai / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .

in an interview with the abendblatt daily on saturday , schavan , who is a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that those concerned about germany 's future energy supply " should n't demonize nuclear power . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan -lrb- l -rrb- and angela merkel support lengthening the lives of germany 's nuclear reactors schavan supports the cdu 's proposal to lengthen the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants and has demanded that more research be done in the area of atomic energy .
the green party , on the other hand , sees the recent incidents and shutdowns as a justification of their anti-nuclear stance .
the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , called the plan supported by the cdu and the free democrats to keep the plants open " irresponsible . "
emergency shutdown the statements came a day after two nuclear power plants in germany were disabled due to irregularities , including one in the northwestern town of lingen , where an emergency shutdown was automatically initiated following an incident in one of the generators .
according to the environment ministry of the german state of lower saxony , where lingen is located , it was only a small incident and no radioactive material was released .
rwe , the plant 's operator , said that all safety devices worked perfectly and that a monitoring device had shut off a tap changer to protect a transformer from being damaged .
rwe added that the appropriate authorities had been informed and that experts from the nuclear regulatory board and technical control board inspected the plant .
it is unclear when the plant will be back up and running .
second plant taken of the grid the other incident occurred at the philippsburg nuclear power plant in southwest germany , and resulted in a section of the facility being taken off the grid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident at the philippsburg plant was less serious , according to plant operators the plant 's operator , energie baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- , said the step was taken during a search for a possible defect in one of the generator transformers .
the 1400 megawatt reactor in lingen began operation in 1988 and , according to data provided by rwe , produces 11 billion kilowatt hours of electricity every year , powering 3.5 million households .
the philippsburg nuclear reactor was built in the 1970s .
the first unit , with a boiling water reactor , went online in 1979 with the second unit , a pressurized water reactor , following five years later .

the ajc has said it found as many as 50 right-wing extremist books listed in the online catalog of amazon.de , some of which are classified by the german authorities as unsuitable for people under 18 .

" that was the hardest 25 kilometers , i ever swam , " said maurer .
the outcome of the race came down to a sprint in the last 500 meters there was a three way tie between maurer , russian swimmer anna uvarova and italy 's federica vitale .
but maurer had a little something extra and pulled away by a couple of lengths to grab the gold .
the battle then became one for silver , with russia 's uvarova reaching out her arm and touching the board just ahead of vitale , who had to settle for bronze .
perhaps the greatest compliment for mauerer came from fellow german thomas lurz , himself a double gold winner in the 5km and 10km open water races .
" angela is simply tops , " said lurz .
" this is a huge achievement . "

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 're out to brighten up a festival that has a rather dark past . the winds have changed in bayreuth - and this new wind is conspicuously tall , blond and good-looking .
thirty-one-year-old katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner , has taken over from her father wolfgang after his more than half-century reign as festival director . once again , the green hill will stage a great show - even before the curtain opens .
every year , the arrival of the rich , famous and powerful is the true highlight of opening night . but bayreuth 's celebrity opera-goers do n't just add to the luster of it all - they are also representative of the dilemma that the festival finds itself in .
after all , prior to the second world war , bayreuth 's most prominent guest was adolf hitler .
he was a passionate wagnerian and good friend of the wagner family . hitler connection casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , pictured with her husband joachim sauer , attends the festival every year many books have been written about whether richard wagner , who died in 1883 , was a kind of forerunner to the nazis and their inhuman ideology .
a decisive conclusion has not been reached . that wagner was an anti-semite is undisputed , however .
he made that clear in his infamous article " judaism in music , " written in 1850 . the direction of the bayreuth festival has been in the hands of wagner 's descendents since it was founded in 1876 .
in 1930 , the composer 's daughter-in-law winifred wagner - an adamant national socialist - took over the management of the festival . she had been a member of the nazi party since 1926 and had a particularly close relationship with hitler .
a decade before he became chancellor of germany , winifred introduced him to the wagner family .
hitler became a regular guest both at their private home and at the festival concert hall on the green hill . long after the dissolution of the third reich and hitler 's death , winifred wagner still held the fuehrer in high regard .
thirty years after the end of the war , she said in an interview with film director juergen syberberg that she saw hitler as a friend and would be pleased if he were to walk through the door . covering up the embarrassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winifred wagner and adolf hitler are pictured in 1934 naturally , her comments caused a stir and her sons wieland and wolfgang strove to limit the damage to the wagner family 's reputation by playing down the embarrassing remarks as those of a senile old woman . wieland said publically that his mother " still believed in the endsieg " - the ultimate victory of nazi germany - and could n't be taken seriously . nevertheless , even to this day the bayreuth festival is haunted by its one-time connection to hitler and the nazi party , particularly because wieland and wolfgang relied on other people to clear the air and work through the family 's " brown " history . the jury is still out on the family 's willingness to approach the matter critically : while some wagner researchers complain they were n't supported by the family , others say they were given a free hand to research as they liked . clock is ticking for glamorous katharina in 1951 , wieland and wolfgang took over joint leadership of the festival , which they managed to resuscitate both artistically and financially after the war .
after wieland 's death in 1966 , wolfgang continued the work alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival hall in bayreuth is known as the " green hill " now wolfgang 's two daughters are following in his footsteps .
it 's katharina wagner who has taken the spotlight on the green hill - because she 's not only young , but also good-looking .
the glamour she brings to the festival is n't overlooked by journalists , and even serious publications discuss her appearance at great length . even in their first year at the helm , katharina and eva have already made some changes , including a live-stream internet broadcast of the performance of " tristan und isolde " and a children 's version of " der fliegende hollaender . " it remains to be seen whether the changing winds have put bayreuth permanently on a new course .
but katharina and eva do n't have that much time to rig the sails : all of their predecessors , from their father and uncle to their great-grand-father and his widow , had the job for life .

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .
the resulting repetition of his program was the cause of some controversy , but few minded when he could make any composition of robert schumann sound as though it was the best music ever written . according to marc gegenfurtner , finding a successor who will be able to live up to christian thielemann 's ability , and match the orchestra 's considerable ambitions , will be one of the toughest challenges for the city of munich . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen / nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ajc has said it found as many as 50 right-wing extremist books listed in the online catalog of amazon.de , some of which are classified by the german authorities as unsuitable for people under 18 .
one of the books available was for instance " der auschwitz-mythos – legende oder wirklichkeit " -lrb- " the auschwitz myth – legend or reality " -rrb- by wilhelm staglich .
" it is unacceptable that books are for sale on amazon.de , that normally are only available under the counter in far-right extremist shops , " the committee said in a statement .
the ajc also accused amazon.de of posting ads on google leading internet users who enter searches for the names of right-wing authors to the amazon.de web site .
" we can not let the spread of internet sales erode laws that ban holocaust denial and incitement to hatred of minorities in germany , " the statement added .
amazon.de denial amazon.de said the company had recently tightened its internal rules over books that glorify or trivialize the nazis , but said there were no immediate plans to remove any books from its online offering .
" we believe that the correct answer to controversial literature is not to ban it , but to engage in discussion over the controversy , " a spokeswoman for amazon.de said .
she added that in the future there would be books on offer which contained " questionable content with regards to the nazis , " but stressed that none of the books in question were restricted or banned in germany. ai / ap / afp / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .
massa lost control of his car and ploughed into a tyre wall , after a piece of flying debris hit his helmet .
ferrari said in a statement that the outcome of the surgery was positive and that massa would remain under observation in intensive care .
he is said to be in a serious but stable condition .
the flying debris is believed to have come from the car of fellow brazilian rubens barrichello .
he visited massa in hospital , saying he wanted to be there because he had been in similar situations himself .
the accident follows the death of briton henry surtees , who was killed at britain 's brands hatch circuit last weekend when he was struck by a flying wheel .
barrichello said the two accidents showed that there was a need for improved safety in motorsport .
" i honestly do n't believe in coincidence in life , " he said .
" things happen for a reason and i think this is the second message . "
mclaren 's lewis hamilton also told reporters that he did not believe the two incidents were coincidental .
" we ca n't ignore it , " he said .

the main demonstration in berlin is set to take place at 13:00 cet at potsdamer platz .
in the evening , a vigil is planned at the brandenburg gate . according to amnesty international 's website , the organizers have no political agenda , but are just trying to bring attention to the human rights situation facing iranian citizens .

ahmadinejad appointed rahim mashai last week as first vice president , making him de-facto acting president until ahmadinejad 's inauguration early next month . while ahmadinejad needs parliamentary approval for his ministers , he is free to select his vice presidents .
according to the constitution , however , the supreme leader has the final say on all state affairs and can veto executive and legislative decisions . this is the second time in five weeks that khamenei , who had put his stamp of approval on ahmadinejad 's re-election , openly voiced criticism of the president . mrm / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has n't done that , although a core group stays true to the ideal . while the constructed language esperanto has not become the global second tongue that its founder ludwik lejzer zamenhof once had hoped , it is making conversation a snap for those gathering in bialystok , poland , for a week-long conference centered on all things esperanto and on keeping zamenhof 's life work alive . seen as unrealistic utopians by some , conference attendees and other esperantists around the globe refuse to give up on the language first presented in a book in 1877 that was thought to be so simple and logical , it would spread like wildfire .
that did not happen , although supporters say zamenhof 's dream , on the 150th anniversary of his birth , of easy communication and international friendship through his language has indeed been realized . that would seem apparent at the 94th world congress of esperanto .
despite coming from around the globe and speaking a variety of native tongues , the 2,000 or so conference delegates will be able to hold complex conversations on a variety of issues thanks to esperanto 's simple grammar and flexible word construction .
that is something many probably could not do if they used the de facto global tongue , english . " -lrb- global english -rrb- is a sort of a language for checking into your hotel room and ordering a meal in a restaurant , " said roy mccoy of the universal esperanto association -lrb- uae -rrb- in rotterdam . " most people could not really have the same kind of discussions in english that they can in their own native languages , " he added .
" in esperanto , they can . " " one who hopes " zamenhof was a jewish ophthalmologist from bialystok , poland , where four languages were spoken .
zamenhof despised the fact that people often remained barricaded in their own language camps and distrusted others who spoke differently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwik lejzer zamenhof zamenhof 's esperanto , which means " one who hopes , " was supposed to change all that and he published the first book on the language , " lingvuo internacia " -lrb- " international language " -rrb- , in 1887 . to him , this language was n't merely a communication tool , but a means of spreading his ideas on the peaceful coexistence of different peoples and cultures .
for that to happen , the language had to be simple , so he stripped away maddening irregularities so common in natural languages , and created an easy-to-learn grammar . the vocabulary of about 900 roots , based on indo-european languages , could be expanded into tens of thousands of words through the addition of prefixes and suffixes or making compounds . the goal was to allow learners to achieve fluency in a short period of time .
mccoy of the uae was fluent in esperanto after nine months , although he says he still has problems with dutch , even though he has lived in the netherlands for more than two decades . even playing field in berlin , a crowd of about forty people gathered one thursday afternoon for a ceremony to rename a small neighborhood park after zamenhof .
as the multinational group chatted , there was no stumbling as there would be if some had to plow their way through a foreign language to talk to a native speaker .
everyone was on a level playing field , which is one of esperanto 's strengths , according to proponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renaming a park in berlin after esperanto 's creator " esperanto wo n't do anything to help you in your career or make you money , " said rudolf fischer , chair of the german esperanto association .
" but we can have contacts with people in other countries whose language we ca n't speak .
esperanto acts as a bridge to other cultures . " some esperantists are no longer focusing on zamenhof 's original goal of world peace , instead seeing the language , and a culture that has grown up around it , as ends in themselves . literary works such as hemingway 's " the old man and the sea " and günter grass ' " tin drum " have been translated into the language .
polish international broadcasting and vatican radio have esperanto services and more than 100 magazines and journals are published in the language , according to the uea . esperanto versions of plays by shakespeare and ionesco have been staged and several movies , including the 1965 cult horror flick " incubus , " starring a pre-star trek william shatner , have had all-esperanto dialog . minority group despite that , esperanto remains something of a fringe phenomenon and , despite the successes that promoters of the language point to , the fact remains that , more than a century after its creation , the community of esperanto speakers is tiny compared to the world population .
estimates of the number of esperanto speakers vary from several hundred thousand to two million . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 89th esperanto conference was in beijing regarding zamenhof 's goals , he might be pleased to see that , in the 21st century , an international language has established itself .
but he likely would n't be as happy to learn that it is not his own created tongue , but english . " while the number of esperantists has remained fairly constant , the population of the world has grown by leaps and bounds .
so you could say there are fewer esperanto speakers today , " said the uae 's mccoy .
" it 's disappointing that esperanto has not grown . " however , he 's more upbeat when talking about the conference , which he describes as a " jolly week " of esperanto-speaking with people from all over the globe discussing everything from african culture to gay esperantists to literature and poetry , music and film .
he says the death of esperanto has been predicted before , but he is n't worried . " it 's sturdy , like a weed , " he said .

they 're out to brighten up a festival that has a rather dark past . the winds have changed in bayreuth - and this new wind is conspicuously tall , blond and good-looking .
thirty-one-year-old katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner , has taken over from her father wolfgang after his more than half-century reign as festival director . once again , the green hill will stage a great show - even before the curtain opens .
every year , the arrival of the rich , famous and powerful is the true highlight of opening night . but bayreuth 's celebrity opera-goers do n't just add to the luster of it all - they are also representative of the dilemma that the festival finds itself in .
after all , prior to the second world war , bayreuth 's most prominent guest was adolf hitler .
he was a passionate wagnerian and good friend of the wagner family . hitler connection casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , pictured with her husband joachim sauer , attends the festival every year many books have been written about whether richard wagner , who died in 1883 , was a kind of forerunner to the nazis and their inhuman ideology .
a decisive conclusion has not been reached . that wagner was an anti-semite is undisputed , however .
he made that clear in his infamous article " judaism in music , " written in 1850 . the direction of the bayreuth festival has been in the hands of wagner 's descendents since it was founded in 1876 .
in 1930 , the composer 's daughter-in-law winifred wagner - an adamant national socialist - took over the management of the festival . she had been a member of the nazi party since 1926 and had a particularly close relationship with hitler .
a decade before he became chancellor of germany , winifred introduced him to the wagner family .
hitler became a regular guest both at their private home and at the festival concert hall on the green hill . long after the dissolution of the third reich and hitler 's death , winifred wagner still held the fuehrer in high regard .
thirty years after the end of the war , she said in an interview with film director juergen syberberg that she saw hitler as a friend and would be pleased if he were to walk through the door . covering up the embarrassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winifred wagner and adolf hitler are pictured in 1934 naturally , her comments caused a stir and her sons wieland and wolfgang strove to limit the damage to the wagner family 's reputation by playing down the embarrassing remarks as those of a senile old woman . wieland said publically that his mother " still believed in the endsieg " - the ultimate victory of nazi germany - and could n't be taken seriously . nevertheless , even to this day the bayreuth festival is haunted by its one-time connection to hitler and the nazi party , particularly because wieland and wolfgang relied on other people to clear the air and work through the family 's " brown " history . the jury is still out on the family 's willingness to approach the matter critically : while some wagner researchers complain they were n't supported by the family , others say they were given a free hand to research as they liked . clock is ticking for glamorous katharina in 1951 , wieland and wolfgang took over joint leadership of the festival , which they managed to resuscitate both artistically and financially after the war .
after wieland 's death in 1966 , wolfgang continued the work alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival hall in bayreuth is known as the " green hill " now wolfgang 's two daughters are following in his footsteps .
it 's katharina wagner who has taken the spotlight on the green hill - because she 's not only young , but also good-looking .
the glamour she brings to the festival is n't overlooked by journalists , and even serious publications discuss her appearance at great length . even in their first year at the helm , katharina and eva have already made some changes , including a live-stream internet broadcast of the performance of " tristan und isolde " and a children 's version of " der fliegende hollaender . " it remains to be seen whether the changing winds have put bayreuth permanently on a new course .

it has n't done that , although a core group stays true to the ideal . while the constructed language esperanto has not become the global second tongue that its founder ludwik lejzer zamenhof once had hoped , it is making conversation a snap for those gathering in bialystok , poland , for a week-long conference centered on all things esperanto and on keeping zamenhof 's life work alive . seen as unrealistic utopians by some , conference attendees and other esperantists around the globe refuse to give up on the language first presented in a book in 1877 that was thought to be so simple and logical , it would spread like wildfire .
that did not happen , although supporters say zamenhof 's dream , on the 150th anniversary of his birth , of easy communication and international friendship through his language has indeed been realized . that would seem apparent at the 94th world congress of esperanto .
despite coming from around the globe and speaking a variety of native tongues , the 2,000 or so conference delegates will be able to hold complex conversations on a variety of issues thanks to esperanto 's simple grammar and flexible word construction .
that is something many probably could not do if they used the de facto global tongue , english . " -lrb- global english -rrb- is a sort of a language for checking into your hotel room and ordering a meal in a restaurant , " said roy mccoy of the universal esperanto association -lrb- uae -rrb- in rotterdam . " most people could not really have the same kind of discussions in english that they can in their own native languages , " he added .
" in esperanto , they can . " " one who hopes " zamenhof was a jewish ophthalmologist from bialystok , poland , where four languages were spoken .
zamenhof despised the fact that people often remained barricaded in their own language camps and distrusted others who spoke differently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwik lejzer zamenhof zamenhof 's esperanto , which means " one who hopes , " was supposed to change all that and he published the first book on the language , " lingvuo internacia " -lrb- " international language " -rrb- , in 1887 . to him , this language was n't merely a communication tool , but a means of spreading his ideas on the peaceful coexistence of different peoples and cultures .
for that to happen , the language had to be simple , so he stripped away maddening irregularities so common in natural languages , and created an easy-to-learn grammar . the vocabulary of about 900 roots , based on indo-european languages , could be expanded into tens of thousands of words through the addition of prefixes and suffixes or making compounds . the goal was to allow learners to achieve fluency in a short period of time .
mccoy of the uae was fluent in esperanto after nine months , although he says he still has problems with dutch , even though he has lived in the netherlands for more than two decades . even playing field in berlin , a crowd of about forty people gathered one thursday afternoon for a ceremony to rename a small neighborhood park after zamenhof .
as the multinational group chatted , there was no stumbling as there would be if some had to plow their way through a foreign language to talk to a native speaker .
everyone was on a level playing field , which is one of esperanto 's strengths , according to proponents . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : renaming a park in berlin after esperanto 's creator " esperanto wo n't do anything to help you in your career or make you money , " said rudolf fischer , chair of the german esperanto association .
" but we can have contacts with people in other countries whose language we ca n't speak .
esperanto acts as a bridge to other cultures . " some esperantists are no longer focusing on zamenhof 's original goal of world peace , instead seeing the language , and a culture that has grown up around it , as ends in themselves . literary works such as hemingway 's " the old man and the sea " and günter grass ' " tin drum " have been translated into the language .

it has n't done that , although a core group stays true to the ideal . while the constructed language esperanto has not become the global second tongue that its founder ludwik lejzer zamenhof once had hoped , it is making conversation a snap for those gathering in bialystok , poland , for a week-long conference centered on all things esperanto and on keeping zamenhof 's life work alive . seen as unrealistic utopians by some , conference attendees and other esperantists around the globe refuse to give up on the language first presented in a book in 1877 that was thought to be so simple and logical , it would spread like wildfire .
that did not happen , although supporters say zamenhof 's dream , on the 150th anniversary of his birth , of easy communication and international friendship through his language has indeed been realized . that would seem apparent at the 94th world congress of esperanto .
despite coming from around the globe and speaking a variety of native tongues , the 2,000 or so conference delegates will be able to hold complex conversations on a variety of issues thanks to esperanto 's simple grammar and flexible word construction .
that is something many probably could not do if they used the de facto global tongue , english . " -lrb- global english -rrb- is a sort of a language for checking into your hotel room and ordering a meal in a restaurant , " said roy mccoy of the universal esperanto association -lrb- uae -rrb- in rotterdam . " most people could not really have the same kind of discussions in english that they can in their own native languages , " he added .
" in esperanto , they can . " " one who hopes " zamenhof was a jewish ophthalmologist from bialystok , poland , where four languages were spoken .
zamenhof despised the fact that people often remained barricaded in their own language camps and distrusted others who spoke differently . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ludwik lejzer zamenhof zamenhof 's esperanto , which means " one who hopes , " was supposed to change all that and he published the first book on the language , " lingvuo internacia " -lrb- " international language " -rrb- , in 1887 . to him , this language was n't merely a communication tool , but a means of spreading his ideas on the peaceful coexistence of different peoples and cultures .

they 're out to brighten up a festival that has a rather dark past . the winds have changed in bayreuth - and this new wind is conspicuously tall , blond and good-looking .
thirty-one-year-old katharina wagner , great-granddaughter of the composer richard wagner , has taken over from her father wolfgang after his more than half-century reign as festival director . once again , the green hill will stage a great show - even before the curtain opens .
every year , the arrival of the rich , famous and powerful is the true highlight of opening night . but bayreuth 's celebrity opera-goers do n't just add to the luster of it all - they are also representative of the dilemma that the festival finds itself in .
after all , prior to the second world war , bayreuth 's most prominent guest was adolf hitler .
he was a passionate wagnerian and good friend of the wagner family . hitler connection casts long shadow bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , pictured with her husband joachim sauer , attends the festival every year many books have been written about whether richard wagner , who died in 1883 , was a kind of forerunner to the nazis and their inhuman ideology .
a decisive conclusion has not been reached . that wagner was an anti-semite is undisputed , however .
he made that clear in his infamous article " judaism in music , " written in 1850 . the direction of the bayreuth festival has been in the hands of wagner 's descendents since it was founded in 1876 .
in 1930 , the composer 's daughter-in-law winifred wagner - an adamant national socialist - took over the management of the festival . she had been a member of the nazi party since 1926 and had a particularly close relationship with hitler .
a decade before he became chancellor of germany , winifred introduced him to the wagner family .
hitler became a regular guest both at their private home and at the festival concert hall on the green hill . long after the dissolution of the third reich and hitler 's death , winifred wagner still held the fuehrer in high regard .
thirty years after the end of the war , she said in an interview with film director juergen syberberg that she saw hitler as a friend and would be pleased if he were to walk through the door . covering up the embarrassment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : winifred wagner and adolf hitler are pictured in 1934 naturally , her comments caused a stir and her sons wieland and wolfgang strove to limit the damage to the wagner family 's reputation by playing down the embarrassing remarks as those of a senile old woman . wieland said publically that his mother " still believed in the endsieg " - the ultimate victory of nazi germany - and could n't be taken seriously . nevertheless , even to this day the bayreuth festival is haunted by its one-time connection to hitler and the nazi party , particularly because wieland and wolfgang relied on other people to clear the air and work through the family 's " brown " history . the jury is still out on the family 's willingness to approach the matter critically : while some wagner researchers complain they were n't supported by the family , others say they were given a free hand to research as they liked . clock is ticking for glamorous katharina in 1951 , wieland and wolfgang took over joint leadership of the festival , which they managed to resuscitate both artistically and financially after the war .
after wieland 's death in 1966 , wolfgang continued the work alone . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the festival hall in bayreuth is known as the " green hill " now wolfgang 's two daughters are following in his footsteps .
it 's katharina wagner who has taken the spotlight on the green hill - because she 's not only young , but also good-looking .
the glamour she brings to the festival is n't overlooked by journalists , and even serious publications discuss her appearance at great length . even in their first year at the helm , katharina and eva have already made some changes , including a live-stream internet broadcast of the performance of " tristan und isolde " and a children 's version of " der fliegende hollaender . " it remains to be seen whether the changing winds have put bayreuth permanently on a new course .
but katharina and eva do n't have that much time to rig the sails : all of their predecessors , from their father and uncle to their great-grand-father and his widow , had the job for life .

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .
the resulting repetition of his program was the cause of some controversy , but few minded when he could make any composition of robert schumann sound as though it was the best music ever written . according to marc gegenfurtner , finding a successor who will be able to live up to christian thielemann 's ability , and match the orchestra 's considerable ambitions , will be one of the toughest challenges for the city of munich . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen / nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .
the resulting repetition of his program was the cause of some controversy , but few minded when he could make any composition of robert schumann sound as though it was the best music ever written . according to marc gegenfurtner , finding a successor who will be able to live up to christian thielemann 's ability , and match the orchestra 's considerable ambitions , will be one of the toughest challenges for the city of munich . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen / nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

music critics say losing the star conductor is a big setback for the city . the writing had been on the wall for several days , yet the decision , when it came , still sent shockwaves through munich 's cultural scene and well beyond .
christian thielemann , chief conductor of the munich philharmonic since 2004 , will not have his contract renewed when it expires in 2011 . nuances aside , the consensus among local critics is that thielemann 's departure is a great , possibly irreparable , loss for munich .
arts editor for munich 's abendzeitung newspaper , robert braunmueller , said that unless an equivalent successor could be tempted to the job , thielemann 's loss would be remembered as a political debacle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the munich philharmonic is need of a new conductor it was n't money , or even the number of performances , that led to a breakdown in contract negotiations between the world-renowned composer and munich 's cultural affairs department . the sticking point was a clause which gave the orchestra 's general director , paul mueller , the final say in the choice of guest conductors and repertoire over thielemann . thielemann objected to this curtailing of his influence , telling the suedeutsche zeitung " it ca n't be that i have say over 30 concerts and the director over 60 .
that would negate my position as chief conductor . " responding to the decision for the first time publicly on friday , thielemann held out the possibility of a compromise in the dispute , suggesting that performance decisions could be agreed upon by a committee of colleagues .
in a statement released by his lawyer , he said he hoped the council 's decision would not spell the end of negotiations , " as final as it sounds . " however , a munich council spokesperson called the conductor 's offer " a little too late , " adding that the council 's decision was " final . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is popular for capturing another era an acute sense of loss one of thielemann 's chief concerns has been that other conductors might dilute the carefully honed romantic sound of his orchestra . critics have pointed out that this is one of the reasons why few strong guest conductors have been allowed to conduct the munich philharmonic 's concerts .
it 's a sore point in some quarters , where it has been argued that the orchestra has developed a limited repertoire . despite this , thielemann 's directorship will be sorely missed .
those who experienced his concerts regularly , and heard how he teased excellence out of the orchestra , no doubt feel an acute sense of loss . commenting from afar for the berlin-based die welt , manuel brug did n't hide his disdain for thielemann , accusing him of seeking duties that he is incapable of fulfilling . but an accompanying questionnaire , in which die welt asked its readers who the best conductor of a german top orchestra was , provided a rather different estimation : 42 percent of respondents found thielemann the best conductor , far ahead of his nearest rivals simon rattle -lrb- berlin philharmonic -rrb- and mariss jansons -lrb- bavarian radio symphony orchestra -rrb- on 18 and 15 percent respectively . the discrepancy between those who react to thielemann as a person and thielemann as a conductor sheds some light on why this event , which might otherwise have been a routine decision by a cultural council in any one of those german towns with a municipal orchestra , is now so hotly debated .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thielemann is a regular at the bayreuth festival difficult search for a successor neither his personality nor his musical style conform to the standard view of what a modern conductor is supposed to be about .
to some , the protégé of herbert von karajan and daniel barenboim is a dinosaur who no longer fits into the modern orchestral world . but most of the audiences at his concerts and opera performances in vienna , bayreuth , and new york enjoy precisely that : an unapologetic throwback to a romantic musical expression that cares about emotional results , not musicological differences .
it 's one aspect that links thielemann to his predecessor sergiu celibidache , who , 13 years after his death , still enjoys a cult-like following . thielemann 's strength , like celibidache 's , is his skill in performing the symphonies of anton bruckner .
the few pieces thielemann adds to his limited repertoire are works he loves and knows by heart .
the resulting repetition of his program was the cause of some controversy , but few minded when he could make any composition of robert schumann sound as though it was the best music ever written . according to marc gegenfurtner , finding a successor who will be able to live up to christian thielemann 's ability , and match the orchestra 's considerable ambitions , will be one of the toughest challenges for the city of munich . author : jens f. laurson editor : kate bowen / nathan witkop send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it has n't done that , although a core group stays true to the ideal . while the constructed language esperanto has not become the global second tongue that its founder ludwik lejzer zamenhof once had hoped , it is making conversation a snap for those gathering in bialystok , poland , for a week-long conference centered on all things esperanto and on keeping zamenhof 's life work alive . seen as unrealistic utopians by some , conference attendees and other esperantists around the globe refuse to give up on the language first presented in a book in 1877 that was thought to be so simple and logical , it would spread like wildfire .
that did not happen , although supporters say zamenhof 's dream , on the 150th anniversary of his birth , of easy communication and international friendship through his language has indeed been realized . that would seem apparent at the 94th world congress of esperanto .
despite coming from around the globe and speaking a variety of native tongues , the 2,000 or so conference delegates will be able to hold complex conversations on a variety of issues thanks to esperanto 's simple grammar and flexible word construction .

for that to happen , the language had to be simple , so he stripped away maddening irregularities so common in natural languages , and created an easy-to-learn grammar . the vocabulary of about 900 roots , based on indo-european languages , could be expanded into tens of thousands of words through the addition of prefixes and suffixes or making compounds . the goal was to allow learners to achieve fluency in a short period of time .

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the eu will hold a summit in october to set down its policy for global negotiations on a new pact to cut greenhouse gas emissions , carlgren said at a press conference saturday in the swedish town of are , where eu environment ministers were holding a summit .
carlgren said the summit would be preceded a few days earlier by meetings of eu finance and environment ministers on october 20-21 .
" the eu will give its full and final mandate for the talks in copenhagen , " he said in reference to the un climate summit taking place in the danish capital in december .
calgren also stressed the need for developed nations to be prepared to financially support developing nations , so that the latter will be better able to deal with the impacts of climate change .
global recession threatens action on climate change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu environment commissioner stavros dimas has stressed that the financial crisis was no reason to ignore climate change although many experts are optimistic that a deal will be struck in copenhagen , they also fear the financial crisis could force governments to focus on their struggling economies , at the expense of global environmental concerns .
eu environment commissioner stavros dimas , speaking to delegates on friday , stressed that the global financial crisis was " no reason to slow down " , but more an " opportunity for decisive action " .
he added that moving towards a low-carbon economy would allow the 27-member bloc to take advantage of " the fast-growing markets for environment technologies , services and products . "
a leading british expert on the economic impact of climate change , lord nicholas stern , discussed measures such as pricing carbon as well as the advantages of building up energy-efficient technology .
" we understand the basics of what we have to do " in terms of setting targets , he said , as well as identifying areas where action and technology are needed .
" what is left is political will , " stern said .
stern told reporters that there are signs of political will in europe , while in the us it was " emerging " , both at federal and state levels as well as in the private sector .
in china , it was already underway .
however , emerging economies , such as india and china , have refused to commit to greenhouse emissions cuts until developed countries - particularly the us - do the same .
germany slams carbon tariff bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german state secretary for environment matthias machnig says introducing co2 tariffs could send the wrong signal to developing countries the issue generating the most debate at the conference was that of the " carbon tariff " supported by france .
germany forcefully rejected a proposal to impose a co2 tax on products from countries that are not taking steps to reduce greenhouse gases .
matthias machnig , germany 's state secretary for the environment , argued that the tax was a violation of wto agreements , whose goal it is to minimize barriers to trade .
" the signal would be – and that is what some of the developing countries always fear – that this is a new form of eco-imperialism , that we are closing our markets to their products , " he said .
" we have to build up trust , not show what kind of economic instruments we can build up to put pressure on them . "
france first promoted the idea of a carbon tax during eu climate negotiations in 2008 , arguing that it would help create a " level playing field " for european companies competing with firms from countries that have not put a price on carbon emissions .
if a global pact on climate change is not achieved in copenhagen , france is asking that the co2 border tax be reconsidered. mrm / vj / dpa / afp / reuters / ap editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of stall owners , including many chinese , have had their wares confiscated , prompting a high-level protest from beijing . police cited health and fire safety violations in shutting down the 740-acre -lrb- nearly 300-hectare -rrb- bazaar in northeast moscow .
over 100,000 traders were locked out of their stalls and thrown out of work overnight .
since then , officials have accused the market of being a major hub for smuggling activities and have seized the merchants ' wares , demanding documents to prove that they were legally imported .
many of the traders at the cherkizovsky market are migrants .
some are from the caucasus region to russia 's south and others come from the former soviet republics .
but a significant number are chinese , and it was on their behalf that beijing sent a special delegation headed by deputy commerce minister gao hucheng to moscow this week to protest russia 's actions .
" in light of the development of the sino-russian strategic partnership , china urges the russian side to take a historical perspective , legally resolve the situation and protect chinese merchants ' legal rights , " gao said in a statement on friday .
widespread criticism in the chinese media had described the russian treatment of the migrant workers as unfair and illegal .
counterfeit heaven ?
the cherkizovsky market is almost a city within a city .
it houses cafes , apartments , a synagogue and a dental practice .
its sprawling lanes are home to retailers , wholesalers and vendors pushing everything from toys , to leather wares to jeans made in china .
the police raid on june 29 followed complaints by prime minister vladimir putin that cherkizovsky had become a major focus of smuggling and contraband .
he said police had seized over 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in contraband in a raid last fall .
russia ’ s industry ministry estimates that fake designer clothing and accessories accounted for almost half of the market ’ s sales volume in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor luzhkov says it 's not russia 's job to help chinese traders russia 's federal migration service says some 3,000 foreign workers traded at the market , but ngos claim that in total as many as 100,000 traders were left jobless after the police action .
russia 's vedemosti newspaper reported that some 80,000 chinese lost their jobs after the cherkizovsky closure .
but authorities have said the migrant merchants will not be getting help from the russian government .
" it 's not our job to find new trading areas for our chinese friends , " moscow mayor yury luzhkov was quoted as saying .
it is unlikely that the comment sat well with the beijing delegation that met with representatives from the russian investigation committee and the foreign ministry on friday .
" the investigation committee informed the chinese delegation about the criminal probe involving smuggling and the production of goods , in violation of health and security regulations , " moscow investigators told reporters .
beijing calls for rights protection according the russian committee , the beijing delegation has expressed support for the anti-smuggling investigation and for russia ’ s efforts at fighting contraband and semi-legal import schemes .
chinese minister gao hucheng reprimanded chinese traders for the way they operated in russia and said they must change their conduct and comply with russian customs laws .
but china called on the russian authorities to ensure the personal safety of the traders and to protect their legal rights .
the cherkizovsky market has become notorious for its racist attacks against immigrants from asia and the caucasus , who have increasingly been victims of mounting nationalism and ethnic intolerance in russia. nw / ai / reuters / ria editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with the abendblatt daily on saturday , schavan , who is a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that those concerned about germany 's future energy supply " should n't demonize nuclear power . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan -lrb- l -rrb- and angela merkel support lengthening the lives of germany 's nuclear reactors schavan supports the cdu 's proposal to lengthen the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants and has demanded that more research be done in the area of atomic energy .
the green party , on the other hand , sees the recent incidents and shutdowns as a justification of their anti-nuclear stance .
the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , called the plan supported by the cdu and the free democrats to keep the plants open " irresponsible . "
emergency shutdown the statements came a day after two nuclear power plants in germany were disabled due to irregularities , including one in the northwestern town of lingen , where an emergency shutdown was automatically initiated following an incident in one of the generators .
according to the environment ministry of the german state of lower saxony , where lingen is located , it was only a small incident and no radioactive material was released .
rwe , the plant 's operator , said that all safety devices worked perfectly and that a monitoring device had shut off a tap changer to protect a transformer from being damaged .
rwe added that the appropriate authorities had been informed and that experts from the nuclear regulatory board and technical control board inspected the plant .
it is unclear when the plant will be back up and running .
second plant taken of the grid the other incident occurred at the philippsburg nuclear power plant in southwest germany , and resulted in a section of the facility being taken off the grid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident at the philippsburg plant was less serious , according to plant operators the plant 's operator , energie baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- , said the step was taken during a search for a possible defect in one of the generator transformers .
the 1400 megawatt reactor in lingen began operation in 1988 and , according to data provided by rwe , produces 11 billion kilowatt hours of electricity every year , powering 3.5 million households .
the philippsburg nuclear reactor was built in the 1970s .
the first unit , with a boiling water reactor , went online in 1979 with the second unit , a pressurized water reactor , following five years later .
together the two sections provide a quarter of the electricity needs of the 10 million people living in the state of baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 25.07.2009 reports : porsche deeper in debt than thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's bid to take over vw almost pushed them into insolvency the financial woes of germany 's porsche are bigger than previously thought , media are reporting .
the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .
the final touches to the takeover are to be worked out in the coming months .
focus said vw finance experts are to comb through porsche 's balance sheets over the coming days and then determine the purchasing price for the luxury brand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , porsche will be in vw 's stable of brands volkswagen already controls a whole host of car brands ranging from swedish heavy truck maker scania to sports car manufacturers including bugatti and lamborghini which sit alongside the luxury bentley and high-end audi names .
most vw sales , however , come from its bread-and-butter golf and polo models , together with czech carmaker skoda and spain 's seat .
porsche and vw employ almost 378,000 , including 12,800 at porsche , with almost half the total based in germany .
vw law re-examination the merger between vw and porsche will mean that the so-called " volkswagen law " would then also apply to porsche .
the controversial law grants the german state of lower saxony a blocking minority in vw , which is based in the city of wolfsburg .
the legislation dates back to the 1960s , and was designed to protect the automaker against hostile takeovers .
the law has long been under scrutiny from the eu , which sees it as protectionist and infringing on the free flow of capital .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the eu commission with jurisdiction over internal markets and services is currently debating whether to take the matter to the eu court of justice for a second time. ai / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .

the flying debris is believed to have come from the car of fellow brazilian rubens barrichello .

the accident follows the death of briton henry surtees , who was killed at britain 's brands hatch circuit last weekend when he was struck by a flying wheel .
barrichello said the two accidents showed that there was a need for improved safety in motorsport .
" i honestly do n't believe in coincidence in life , " he said .
" things happen for a reason and i think this is the second message . "
mclaren 's lewis hamilton also told reporters that he did not believe the two incidents were coincidental .

luxembourg 's andy schleck looks set to take the second spot .
spain 's juan manuel garate won the 167-kilometer -lrb- 103.8-mile -rrb- stage 20 from montelimar to the dreaded mont ventoux , which features a 21.1-kilometer -lrb- 13.1-mile -rrb- ride up a very steep ascent .
his time was four hours 39 minutes and 21seconds .
her held off fellow breakaway rider , germany 's tony martin , by three seconds .
but possibly the one contestant with the biggest smile tomorrow , will be lance armstrong , the seven time tour champion .
he has guaranteed himself a spot on the podium as well .
" hey , i ca n't complain .
for an old fart coming in here and getting on the podium with these young guys , not so bad , " said armstrong .
he is five minutes 24 seconds off the pace .
armstrong , the texas native , came back to the tour after a hiatus of three years to try to win the tour for a record eighth time and also to promote his cancer foundation .
armstrong was not assured of third place .
while contador had a comfortable lead throughout the stage 20 , second through sixth place rankings were separated by 1 minute 28 seconds .
armstrong had britain 's bradley wiggins close on his heels for much of the day .
on sunday , the final stage is a largely ceremonial ride into paris , traditionally without breakaway attempts among the leaders .
only an accident can prevent contador from going down the champs-elysees as the winner. av / reuters / afp editor : kateri jochum send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the crash occurred during the qualifying session for sunday 's hungarian grand prix .
massa lost control of his car and ploughed into a tyre wall , after a piece of flying debris hit his helmet .
ferrari said in a statement that the outcome of the surgery was positive and that massa would remain under observation in intensive care .
he is said to be in a serious but stable condition .
the flying debris is believed to have come from the car of fellow brazilian rubens barrichello .
he visited massa in hospital , saying he wanted to be there because he had been in similar situations himself .
the accident follows the death of briton henry surtees , who was killed at britain 's brands hatch circuit last weekend when he was struck by a flying wheel .
barrichello said the two accidents showed that there was a need for improved safety in motorsport .
" i honestly do n't believe in coincidence in life , " he said .
" things happen for a reason and i think this is the second message . "
mclaren 's lewis hamilton also told reporters that he did not believe the two incidents were coincidental .

the main demonstration in berlin is set to take place at 13:00 cet at potsdamer platz .
in the evening , a vigil is planned at the brandenburg gate . according to amnesty international 's website , the organizers have no political agenda , but are just trying to bring attention to the human rights situation facing iranian citizens .

ahmadinejad appointed rahim mashai last week as first vice president , making him de-facto acting president until ahmadinejad 's inauguration early next month . while ahmadinejad needs parliamentary approval for his ministers , he is free to select his vice presidents .
according to the constitution , however , the supreme leader has the final say on all state affairs and can veto executive and legislative decisions . this is the second time in five weeks that khamenei , who had put his stamp of approval on ahmadinejad 's re-election , openly voiced criticism of the president . mrm / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ajc has said it found as many as 50 right-wing extremist books listed in the online catalog of amazon.de , some of which are classified by the german authorities as unsuitable for people under 18 .
one of the books available was for instance " der auschwitz-mythos – legende oder wirklichkeit " -lrb- " the auschwitz myth – legend or reality " -rrb- by wilhelm staglich .
" it is unacceptable that books are for sale on amazon.de , that normally are only available under the counter in far-right extremist shops , " the committee said in a statement .
the ajc also accused amazon.de of posting ads on google leading internet users who enter searches for the names of right-wing authors to the amazon.de web site .
" we can not let the spread of internet sales erode laws that ban holocaust denial and incitement to hatred of minorities in germany , " the statement added .
amazon.de denial amazon.de said the company had recently tightened its internal rules over books that glorify or trivialize the nazis , but said there were no immediate plans to remove any books from its online offering .
" we believe that the correct answer to controversial literature is not to ban it , but to engage in discussion over the controversy , " a spokeswoman for amazon.de said .
she added that in the future there would be books on offer which contained " questionable content with regards to the nazis , " but stressed that none of the books in question were restricted or banned in germany. ai / ap / afp / epd editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the main demonstration in berlin is set to take place at 13:00 cet at potsdamer platz .
in the evening , a vigil is planned at the brandenburg gate . according to amnesty international 's website , the organizers have no political agenda , but are just trying to bring attention to the human rights situation facing iranian citizens .

ahmadinejad appointed rahim mashai last week as first vice president , making him de-facto acting president until ahmadinejad 's inauguration early next month . while ahmadinejad needs parliamentary approval for his ministers , he is free to select his vice presidents .
according to the constitution , however , the supreme leader has the final say on all state affairs and can veto executive and legislative decisions . this is the second time in five weeks that khamenei , who had put his stamp of approval on ahmadinejad 's re-election , openly voiced criticism of the president . mrm / dpa / afp / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with the abendblatt daily on saturday , schavan , who is a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that those concerned about germany 's future energy supply " should n't demonize nuclear power . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan -lrb- l -rrb- and angela merkel support lengthening the lives of germany 's nuclear reactors schavan supports the cdu 's proposal to lengthen the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants and has demanded that more research be done in the area of atomic energy .
the green party , on the other hand , sees the recent incidents and shutdowns as a justification of their anti-nuclear stance .
the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , called the plan supported by the cdu and the free democrats to keep the plants open " irresponsible . "
emergency shutdown the statements came a day after two nuclear power plants in germany were disabled due to irregularities , including one in the northwestern town of lingen , where an emergency shutdown was automatically initiated following an incident in one of the generators .
according to the environment ministry of the german state of lower saxony , where lingen is located , it was only a small incident and no radioactive material was released .
rwe , the plant 's operator , said that all safety devices worked perfectly and that a monitoring device had shut off a tap changer to protect a transformer from being damaged .
rwe added that the appropriate authorities had been informed and that experts from the nuclear regulatory board and technical control board inspected the plant .
it is unclear when the plant will be back up and running .
second plant taken of the grid the other incident occurred at the philippsburg nuclear power plant in southwest germany , and resulted in a section of the facility being taken off the grid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident at the philippsburg plant was less serious , according to plant operators the plant 's operator , energie baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- , said the step was taken during a search for a possible defect in one of the generator transformers .
the 1400 megawatt reactor in lingen began operation in 1988 and , according to data provided by rwe , produces 11 billion kilowatt hours of electricity every year , powering 3.5 million households .
the philippsburg nuclear reactor was built in the 1970s .
the first unit , with a boiling water reactor , went online in 1979 with the second unit , a pressurized water reactor , following five years later .
together the two sections provide a quarter of the electricity needs of the 10 million people living in the state of baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with the abendblatt daily on saturday , schavan , who is a member of chancellor merkel 's conservative christian democratic party -lrb- cdu -rrb- , said that those concerned about germany 's future energy supply " should n't demonize nuclear power . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : annette schavan -lrb- l -rrb- and angela merkel support lengthening the lives of germany 's nuclear reactors schavan supports the cdu 's proposal to lengthen the lifespan of germany 's nuclear power plants and has demanded that more research be done in the area of atomic energy .
the green party , on the other hand , sees the recent incidents and shutdowns as a justification of their anti-nuclear stance .
the head of the green party 's parliamentary group , baerbel hoehn , called the plan supported by the cdu and the free democrats to keep the plants open " irresponsible . "
emergency shutdown the statements came a day after two nuclear power plants in germany were disabled due to irregularities , including one in the northwestern town of lingen , where an emergency shutdown was automatically initiated following an incident in one of the generators .
according to the environment ministry of the german state of lower saxony , where lingen is located , it was only a small incident and no radioactive material was released .
rwe , the plant 's operator , said that all safety devices worked perfectly and that a monitoring device had shut off a tap changer to protect a transformer from being damaged .
rwe added that the appropriate authorities had been informed and that experts from the nuclear regulatory board and technical control board inspected the plant .
it is unclear when the plant will be back up and running .
second plant taken of the grid the other incident occurred at the philippsburg nuclear power plant in southwest germany , and resulted in a section of the facility being taken off the grid .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the incident at the philippsburg plant was less serious , according to plant operators the plant 's operator , energie baden-wuerttemberg -lrb- enbw -rrb- , said the step was taken during a search for a possible defect in one of the generator transformers .
the 1400 megawatt reactor in lingen began operation in 1988 and , according to data provided by rwe , produces 11 billion kilowatt hours of electricity every year , powering 3.5 million households .
the philippsburg nuclear reactor was built in the 1970s .
the first unit , with a boiling water reactor , went online in 1979 with the second unit , a pressurized water reactor , following five years later .
together the two sections provide a quarter of the electricity needs of the 10 million people living in the state of baden-wuerttemberg. mrm / dpa / ap editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 25.07.2009 reports : porsche deeper in debt than thought großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : porsche 's bid to take over vw almost pushed them into insolvency the financial woes of germany 's porsche are bigger than previously thought , media are reporting .
the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .
the final touches to the takeover are to be worked out in the coming months .
focus said vw finance experts are to comb through porsche 's balance sheets over the coming days and then determine the purchasing price for the luxury brand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , porsche will be in vw 's stable of brands volkswagen already controls a whole host of car brands ranging from swedish heavy truck maker scania to sports car manufacturers including bugatti and lamborghini which sit alongside the luxury bentley and high-end audi names .
most vw sales , however , come from its bread-and-butter golf and polo models , together with czech carmaker skoda and spain 's seat .
porsche and vw employ almost 378,000 , including 12,800 at porsche , with almost half the total based in germany .
vw law re-examination the merger between vw and porsche will mean that the so-called " volkswagen law " would then also apply to porsche .
the controversial law grants the german state of lower saxony a blocking minority in vw , which is based in the city of wolfsburg .
the legislation dates back to the 1960s , and was designed to protect the automaker against hostile takeovers .
the law has long been under scrutiny from the eu , which sees it as protectionist and infringing on the free flow of capital .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the eu commission with jurisdiction over internal markets and services is currently debating whether to take the matter to the eu court of justice for a second time. ai / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the sports car maker is some 14 billion euros -lrb- $ 20 billion -rrb- in debt , about 5 billion more than porsche had earlier said . according to media reports , porsche was on the brink of insolvency when the struggle between the sports car maker and volkswagen finally came to a head .
focus has reported that porsche would have been insolvent within two weeks had vw not pushed through with its takeover ambitions .
ironically , the maker of iconic sports car like the 911 had initially wanted to gain control over volkswagen – and it was the financial burden of that very takeover bid that pushed the sports car maker to the edge .
porsche had always said its debt level was at around nine billion euros -lrb- $ 13 billion -rrb- , yet on saturday the newsmagazines focus and der spiegel both reported that marathon talks between porsche and vw revealed that in fact , porsche has run up debts of as much as 14 billion euros .
vw and porsche in takeover talks vw is currently in negotiations with porsche over the terms of the two-step takeover and details of porsche 's balance sheets are likely to determine the purchasing price for the luxury car maker .
volkswagen plans to acquire 49.9 percent of porsche this year and to take more than 50 percent in 2010 .
porsche , however , is to stay an independent brand .
the final touches to the takeover are to be worked out in the coming months .
focus said vw finance experts are to comb through porsche 's balance sheets over the coming days and then determine the purchasing price for the luxury brand .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : soon , porsche will be in vw 's stable of brands volkswagen already controls a whole host of car brands ranging from swedish heavy truck maker scania to sports car manufacturers including bugatti and lamborghini which sit alongside the luxury bentley and high-end audi names .
most vw sales , however , come from its bread-and-butter golf and polo models , together with czech carmaker skoda and spain 's seat .
porsche and vw employ almost 378,000 , including 12,800 at porsche , with almost half the total based in germany .
vw law re-examination the merger between vw and porsche will mean that the so-called " volkswagen law " would then also apply to porsche .
the controversial law grants the german state of lower saxony a blocking minority in vw , which is based in the city of wolfsburg .
the legislation dates back to the 1960s , and was designed to protect the automaker against hostile takeovers .
the law has long been under scrutiny from the eu , which sees it as protectionist and infringing on the free flow of capital .
according to the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper , the eu commission with jurisdiction over internal markets and services is currently debating whether to take the matter to the eu court of justice for a second time. ai / afp / dpa editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

thousands of stall owners , including many chinese , have had their wares confiscated , prompting a high-level protest from beijing . police cited health and fire safety violations in shutting down the 740-acre -lrb- nearly 300-hectare -rrb- bazaar in northeast moscow .
over 100,000 traders were locked out of their stalls and thrown out of work overnight .
since then , officials have accused the market of being a major hub for smuggling activities and have seized the merchants ' wares , demanding documents to prove that they were legally imported .
many of the traders at the cherkizovsky market are migrants .
some are from the caucasus region to russia 's south and others come from the former soviet republics .
but a significant number are chinese , and it was on their behalf that beijing sent a special delegation headed by deputy commerce minister gao hucheng to moscow this week to protest russia 's actions .
" in light of the development of the sino-russian strategic partnership , china urges the russian side to take a historical perspective , legally resolve the situation and protect chinese merchants ' legal rights , " gao said in a statement on friday .
widespread criticism in the chinese media had described the russian treatment of the migrant workers as unfair and illegal .
counterfeit heaven ?
the cherkizovsky market is almost a city within a city .
it houses cafes , apartments , a synagogue and a dental practice .
its sprawling lanes are home to retailers , wholesalers and vendors pushing everything from toys , to leather wares to jeans made in china .
the police raid on june 29 followed complaints by prime minister vladimir putin that cherkizovsky had become a major focus of smuggling and contraband .
he said police had seized over 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 2 billion -rrb- in contraband in a raid last fall .
russia ’ s industry ministry estimates that fake designer clothing and accessories accounted for almost half of the market ’ s sales volume in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow mayor luzhkov says it 's not russia 's job to help chinese traders russia 's federal migration service says some 3,000 foreign workers traded at the market , but ngos claim that in total as many as 100,000 traders were left jobless after the police action .
russia 's vedemosti newspaper reported that some 80,000 chinese lost their jobs after the cherkizovsky closure .
but authorities have said the migrant merchants will not be getting help from the russian government .
" it 's not our job to find new trading areas for our chinese friends , " moscow mayor yury luzhkov was quoted as saying .
it is unlikely that the comment sat well with the beijing delegation that met with representatives from the russian investigation committee and the foreign ministry on friday .
" the investigation committee informed the chinese delegation about the criminal probe involving smuggling and the production of goods , in violation of health and security regulations , " moscow investigators told reporters .
beijing calls for rights protection according the russian committee , the beijing delegation has expressed support for the anti-smuggling investigation and for russia ’ s efforts at fighting contraband and semi-legal import schemes .
chinese minister gao hucheng reprimanded chinese traders for the way they operated in russia and said they must change their conduct and comply with russian customs laws .
but china called on the russian authorities to ensure the personal safety of the traders and to protect their legal rights .
the cherkizovsky market has become notorious for its racist attacks against immigrants from asia and the caucasus , who have increasingly been victims of mounting nationalism and ethnic intolerance in russia. nw / ai / reuters / ria editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since then , officials have accused the market of being a major hub for smuggling activities and have seized the merchants ' wares , demanding documents to prove that they were legally imported .
many of the traders at the cherkizovsky market are migrants .
some are from the caucasus region to russia 's south and others come from the former soviet republics .
but a significant number are chinese , and it was on their behalf that beijing sent a special delegation headed by deputy commerce minister gao hucheng to moscow this week to protest russia 's actions .
" in light of the development of the sino-russian strategic partnership , china urges the russian side to take a historical perspective , legally resolve the situation and protect chinese merchants ' legal rights , " gao said in a statement on friday .

russia 's vedemosti newspaper reported that some 80,000 chinese lost their jobs after the cherkizovsky closure .
but authorities have said the migrant merchants will not be getting help from the russian government .
" it 's not our job to find new trading areas for our chinese friends , " moscow mayor yury luzhkov was quoted as saying .

advertisement footage of you you giving birth to the cub the first giant panda conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm has been born in china , scientists say .
the cub was born early on thursday at a panda reserve in sichuan province .
scientists hope that the innovation could help the endangered species , which numbers about 1,600 in the wild , avoid extinction .
it would mean frozen semen from zoos around the world could be used to widen the gene pool and avoid inbreeding .
' no harm ' " with the technology , we can keep the sperm frozen for decades , " said huang yan , a researcher with the china giant panda protection and research centre in wolong .
" the freezing and thawing causes no harm or change to the genetic structure of the sperm , so the technology has no influence on the baby , " he told xinhua news agency .
similar attempts had been made before but had failed , he said .
the baby panda , born to 11-year-old you you , would be named once its sex had been determined , the researcher said .
dr barbara durrant of san diego zoo welcomed the idea of exchanging frozen panda semen with other zoos .
this would cause far less stress to the pandas than shipping them to other zoos in the hope that they would mate , she said .
the giant panda is one of the world 's most endangered species , because of the destruction of its forest habitat , a short annual conception window for female pandas and lack of contact between isolated populations .
according to experts only about 1,600 pandas remain in the wild , mostly in sichuan and neighbouring shaanxi and gansu provinces .
another 180 pandas are being raised in captivity in china .

advertisement footage of you you giving birth to the cub the first giant panda conceived through artificial insemination using frozen sperm has been born in china , scientists say .
the cub was born early on thursday at a panda reserve in sichuan province .
scientists hope that the innovation could help the endangered species , which numbers about 1,600 in the wild , avoid extinction .
it would mean frozen semen from zoos around the world could be used to widen the gene pool and avoid inbreeding .
' no harm ' " with the technology , we can keep the sperm frozen for decades , " said huang yan , a researcher with the china giant panda protection and research centre in wolong .
" the freezing and thawing causes no harm or change to the genetic structure of the sperm , so the technology has no influence on the baby , " he told xinhua news agency .
similar attempts had been made before but had failed , he said .
the baby panda , born to 11-year-old you you , would be named once its sex had been determined , the researcher said .
dr barbara durrant of san diego zoo welcomed the idea of exchanging frozen panda semen with other zoos .
this would cause far less stress to the pandas than shipping them to other zoos in the hope that they would mate , she said .
the giant panda is one of the world 's most endangered species , because of the destruction of its forest habitat , a short annual conception window for female pandas and lack of contact between isolated populations .
according to experts only about 1,600 pandas remain in the wild , mostly in sichuan and neighbouring shaanxi and gansu provinces .
another 180 pandas are being raised in captivity in china .

mr phillips continued as chairman when the organisation evolved to cover the areas of age , religion and belief , sexual orientation and the promotion of human rights in 2006 . "

a refusal by the national audit office to fully sign off the commission 's accounts added to the pressure , with opposition mps accusing it of a " careless waste of taxpayers ' money " .
the body admitted it had not followed the rules when it re-employed seven people who had taken redundancy from the cre - at a cost of £ 629,276 - on short-term contracts worth £ 323,708 .
it prompted mr summerskill to say that " destructive headlines " about mr phillips were interfering with the commission 's work and that he was damaging its cause by staying on .
he told the bbc 's today programme : " trevor is a brilliant communicator , he 's a fantastic maker of television programmes , but he has not been successful in running the commission and bringing it together .
" we should be crystal clear - this is n't an issue about policies , this is n't an issue about whether the commission should be a modern 21st century commission , it 's an issue about old-fashioned management . "
in a statement , the commission said it had a " clear sense of direction " as demonstrated in its three-year strategy which had been unanimously agreed by the board .
the statement continued : " it is regrettable that ben summerskill has chosen not to re-apply for a position as commissioner , given his experience and expertise .
but we need to focus on what we 're delivering for the public .
" the commission , led by trevor phillips , continues to work on a number of substantial fronts including delivering a new equality bill which will make britain a fairer and better place to live and making our human rights inquiry recommendations lead to real change in public service delivery . "
