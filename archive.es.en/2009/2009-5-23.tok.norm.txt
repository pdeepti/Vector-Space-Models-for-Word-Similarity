german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .
at present , the only operating mosques in greece are in the north-eastern region of thrace , home to some 100,000 muslims. dfm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .

an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.05.2009 horst koehler wins second term as german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler -lrb- l -rrb- won the majority he needed in the first round of voting members of germany 's electoral college elected incumbent horst koehler as president in a vote that could have profound implications for the general elections in september . horst koehler , backed by chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , was running in a close race against gesine schwan , who was supported by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .
at present , the only operating mosques in greece are in the north-eastern region of thrace , home to some 100,000 muslims. dfm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .

an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .
at present , the only operating mosques in greece are in the north-eastern region of thrace , home to some 100,000 muslims. dfm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .

it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .

in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.05.2009 horst koehler wins second term as german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler -lrb- l -rrb- won the majority he needed in the first round of voting members of germany 's electoral college elected incumbent horst koehler as president in a vote that could have profound implications for the general elections in september . horst koehler , backed by chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , was running in a close race against gesine schwan , who was supported by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .

in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .

an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .
at present , the only operating mosques in greece are in the north-eastern region of thrace , home to some 100,000 muslims. dfm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .
electoral college bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the candidates were battling to see who gets to call bellevue castle home under germany 's constitution , the head of state is chosen by a 1,224-member electoral college called the federal assembly .

the spd and cdu are currently holding together a rocky coalition government , and koehler 's win could make all the difference in the looming parliamentary elections. mrm / dpa / ap / reuters editor : toma tasovac send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .

"
german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .
therefore , according to the ministry , the cola should not be be classified as a food product , but falls instead under the jurisdiction of the german narcotics act .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coca leaf is used worldwide as food additive " coca leaf extracts , without the active ingredient of cocaine , are used worldwide for food flavorings and are completely safe , " a red bull spokesman told the frankfurter neue presse newspaper .
in the german state of hesse , the ministry of the environment in wiesbaden said on friday , may 22 , that it had confirmed the presence of the coca leaf extract in the drink .
it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .
officials at red bull took a different view of the situation , and said that they had a different interpretation of the legality of coca products being used as flavorings .
" we are of the opinion that our product is marketable , " frank farnsteiner , a spokesman for red bull , told german public radio. av / dpa / hronline editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german food regulators discovered traces of cocaine in cans of red bull cola and the energy drink has been ordered off the shelves in some states . officials in hesse , north rhine-westphalia , thuringia and rhineland-palatinate have banned the drink after health officials noted trace amounts of cocaine in cans of the cola .
" the coke is not harmful , but it violates food law , " said thomas schulz , a spokesman for the thuringian ministry of health .
the north rhine-westphalia institute for health and work -lrb- liga -rrb- found traces of cocaine , from a leaf stem that had supposedly had all the cocaine extracted from it .

it noted that it was part of the recipe and that the product was not contaminated .
therefore they have not issued a warning , but have ordered a recall of the product .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .
at present , the only operating mosques in greece are in the north-eastern region of thrace , home to some 100,000 muslims. dfm / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 23.05.2009 horst koehler wins second term as german president großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koehler -lrb- l -rrb- won the majority he needed in the first round of voting members of germany 's electoral college elected incumbent horst koehler as president in a vote that could have profound implications for the general elections in september . horst koehler , backed by chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , was running in a close race against gesine schwan , who was supported by the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- .
the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the incumbent secured an absolute majority in the first round of voting by the 1,224-seat assembly , with 613 votes .
that was exactly the number he needed to win .
schwan polled 503 votes in the secret ballot .
the president , whose new term of office begins on july 1 , thanked delegates and expressed respect for his three rival candidates .
" we 've got a lot of work ahead of us , but we will manage , " he said in reference to the economic crisis which has badly affected germany , along with other countries around the world .
the victory for the 66-year-old koehler in the first round is expected to give merkel 's conservatives an important boost ahead of the september parliamentary election , where she is seeking a second four-year term .
close race bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan -lrb- l . -rrb- was backed by the social democrats schwan , who also ran against koehler in the presidential election five years ago , had been stumping the country for months , wooing support from potentially wavering electoral-college members .
the spd was hoping for the backing of the left party and the greens .
a political scientist and former president of the europa university viadrina in frankfurt an der oder , near the polish border , schwan recently stirred a national debate by saying she feared the economic crisis was creating an explosive social atmosphere in germany .
horst koehler had criticized those remarks , indirectly accusing his social democratic challenger of scaremongering .
boon for the economy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the defeat of incumbent horst koehler would have severely damage chancellor merkel 's cdu merkel is hoping that koehler 's background will be an asset to the nation as it continues to fight its way out of the recession .
an economist who once headed the international monetary fund -lrb- imf -rrb- , koehler is generally a popular figure , although he has occasionally upset conservatives by criticizing big business .
two opposition parties , the center-right free democratic party -lrb- fdp -rrb- and the bavaria-only free voters -lrb- fw -rrb- , swung behind koehler and the cdu , ensuring in theory that he would have a two-vote majority , though up to the last minute it wasn ’ t certain if all the fw voters would fall into line .
koehler 's chances of victory had improved on friday when the leader of the hardline left party , lothar bisky , had not ruled out the possibility of some of its members voting for the incumbent , even though the party was fielding a candidate of its own , actor peter sodann .

the attack came a day after clashes between more than 1,000 muslim protesters and greek police in central athens , after the police allegedly desecrated a copy of the koran .
the march was organized by leftist , immigrant and anti-racism groups .
violence broke out after the rally when a group of protesters began throwing projectiles at police .
immigrant groups allege that an athens police officer tore apart and stepped on the koran of a coffee shop customer during a police check in central athens on thursday .
police said they have launched an investigation into the incident some 46 protesters were arrested friday during the clashes , while seven muslim immigrants and seven policemen were hospitalized for treatment .
more than 70 cars and around a dozen businesses were damaged in the clashes , which sent tourists running for cover in nearby hotels .
a day earlier an even larger crowd of around 1,500 muslim immigrants rallied before the march degenerated into violence .
police used tear gas to disperse the crowds .
muslim hardships many muslims in athens use abandoned factories and converted coffee shops as makeshift prayer houses .
some muslim groups have complained of police brutality and poor treatment by officials in the past .
athens is the only european capital which does not have a proper mosque or cemetery to serve its muslim population .
there are more than 300,000 muslims living in athens , mainly from various parts of northern africa and pakistan .

emily holzhausen of carers uk : " we need action now " the allowance is designed to help ease the strain of additional costs , working part-time or not being able to work at all because of the need to care for a loved one .
but the charities say carers do not receive enough money and that many of them are struggling to cover their outgoings .
they also say most carers do not qualify for the allowance at all because of the current rules .

the rejected plan estimated 54 % of customers would have got all funds within three months , while 76 % would be fully refunded within two years .
instead depositors will now receive funds from the isle of man government 's bank compensation scheme .
a hearing to place the bank into liquidation will take place on 27 may .
once ksfiom goes into liquidation , it will trigger payouts from the government 's depositor compensation scheme for savers of up to the first £ 50,000 lost , plus any other money that is recovered during the liquidation process .
the ksfiom depositors ' action group had argued that the rejected plan gave them little more than they would receive under liquidation and organised an internet campaign urging savers to vote against it .
provisional liquidators had been appointed on 9 october following the collapse of its parent group .
