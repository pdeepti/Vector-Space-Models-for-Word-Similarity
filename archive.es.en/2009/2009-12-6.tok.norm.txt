war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 37-year-old babbel was fired less than 24 hours after stuttgart drew 1-1 with bochum , leaving the swabians in 16th place in the 18-team division with only 12 points from 15 games .
after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .
i did not find it . "
switzerland 's christian gross is to take on babbel 's job , the club confirmed on sunday evening. nk / dpa / reuters / afp editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .
the prime minister has faced charges of bribery , tax fraud and false accounting and has been accused of trying to reform the judicial system to his own ends .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 37-year-old babbel was fired less than 24 hours after stuttgart drew 1-1 with bochum , leaving the swabians in 16th place in the 18-team division with only 12 points from 15 games .
after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .
i did not find it . "

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've occupied buildings and held rallies .
but instead of sending in the police , the city is now trying to meet their demands . the name gaengeviertel literally means the neighborhood of passageways .
and that 's exactly what the gaengeviertel in hamburg once was , a dense district of narrow alleys .
there 's very little left of the old gaengeviertel now .
but just west of the showy jungfernstieg waterfront boulevard , shoulder to shoulder with modern office and apartment buildings is a remnant of the neighborhood a bit like it once was .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the gaengeviertel are surrounded by modern buildings this group of twelve run-down buildings has stood mostly empty for years and the city was delighted when an investor willing to foot the bill for the development of the project was found .
dutch investment company hanzevast drew up plans to tear down some of the original buildings , restore the facades of others , and develop a complex of high-end offices and apartment buildings .
but what the city and hanzevast had not realized is that new life had sprouted in the historic neighborhood .
protest movement late in august a group of artists moved into the gaengeviertel to protest the sale and hanzevast 's development plans .
in the dim and musty rooms , they 've set up ateliers , an information center and gallery space .
visitors wander in off the street to take a look at the art hanging on the walls .
" it 's like an oasis here , " said andi barelas , an artist who stencils images onto oil drums that then let the light from a fire inside shine through .
" we 're sitting here between glass and concrete .
but this is a bit of the old city center , which is also very important for hamburg 's history . "
the police never arrived to kick the artists out of the gaengeviertel .
instead the artists ' efforts have won them the sympathy of city officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the gaengeviertel , described by one artist as an " oasis " " very soon after the artists occupied part of the property , the hamburg senate got in contact with the artists and the current investor to see if there was a way to meet in part the demands of the artists , " enno isermann of the city 's office for urban development and the environment told deutsche welle .
he says the city is currently renegotiating the redevelopment deal with hanzevast , looking for a way to preserve more of the original buildings while giving space to the artists to work .
possible solutions include the city buying the property back or hanzevast substantially changing their redevelopment plan .
hanzevast has taken the city to court to force the artists to leave , but rulings thus far have not required the city to do so until the property is officially handed over to the investor in february 2010 .
hanzevast declined to comment for this article .
bringing life back downtown according to isermann , the city 's main goals are to preserve part of the historic area while making room for the artists .
while the calls by artists to create a more diversified downtown area may have struck a chord with hamburg residents , he said those in charge of city planning heard them as well .
" the goal of a big city like hamburg is to make life in the city as colorful and multifaceted as possible , " he said .
" that 's certainly another reason why we are trying to take up the artists ' initiatives , because we 're convinced that a lively city like hamburg must make space for such ideas . "
despite the city 's assertions that it wants to bring a new energy downtown , gaengeviertel spokeswoman christine ebeling is wary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since moving in , artists have provided free cultural events for the city according to her , the only ideas the city has presented about reviving the city center after shops close for the day are fair rides or food and beer that you have to pay for .
she says the artists ' free exhibitions bring something to the downtown area that it lacks .
money is a big issue for the artists .
they are frustrated that the city only values things that will be profitable .
while artists can make money selling their work , both ebeling and fellow artist carl hoffmann argue that the contribution made by the art shown in the gaengeviertel is more cultural than commercial .
" this is not for marketing , " hoffmann said as he took down a show to make room for a classical music concert later that night .
" it 's for experiments and workshops , and getting together with other artists from other cities and maybe other countries . "
the price of creativity but the land the buildings occupy is valuable and could be profitable for investors and developers .
hamburg 's daily abendblatt newspaper reported that renovation costs could run as high as 20 million euros -lrb- $ 30.1 million -rrb- and that the city might have to pay two million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- just to get the property back .
but numbers like these do n't worry ebeling .
" if a company or an investor were to do this , i think they would have to pay a lot of money , " she said .
but the artists have access to a team of volunteers and experience seeking donated materials .
she points out the progress that has already been made on the buildings - a new roof on one , repainted walls on another .
" most of us are good workers , " she says .
" we have an architect , we have city planners and we 've got a lot of craftsmen and craftswomen .
so everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it . "

dutch investment company hanzevast drew up plans to tear down some of the original buildings , restore the facades of others , and develop a complex of high-end offices and apartment buildings .

protest movement late in august a group of artists moved into the gaengeviertel to protest the sale and hanzevast 's development plans .

possible solutions include the city buying the property back or hanzevast substantially changing their redevelopment plan .

bringing life back downtown according to isermann , the city 's main goals are to preserve part of the historic area while making room for the artists .

money is a big issue for the artists .
they are frustrated that the city only values things that will be profitable .
while artists can make money selling their work , both ebeling and fellow artist carl hoffmann argue that the contribution made by the art shown in the gaengeviertel is more cultural than commercial .
" this is not for marketing , " hoffmann said as he took down a show to make room for a classical music concert later that night .
" it 's for experiments and workshops , and getting together with other artists from other cities and maybe other countries . "
the price of creativity but the land the buildings occupy is valuable and could be profitable for investors and developers .
hamburg 's daily abendblatt newspaper reported that renovation costs could run as high as 20 million euros -lrb- $ 30.1 million -rrb- and that the city might have to pay two million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- just to get the property back .

he says the city is currently renegotiating the redevelopment deal with hanzevast , looking for a way to preserve more of the original buildings while giving space to the artists to work .
possible solutions include the city buying the property back or hanzevast substantially changing their redevelopment plan .

money is a big issue for the artists .
they are frustrated that the city only values things that will be profitable .
while artists can make money selling their work , both ebeling and fellow artist carl hoffmann argue that the contribution made by the art shown in the gaengeviertel is more cultural than commercial .

" it 's for experiments and workshops , and getting together with other artists from other cities and maybe other countries . "
the price of creativity but the land the buildings occupy is valuable and could be profitable for investors and developers .
hamburg 's daily abendblatt newspaper reported that renovation costs could run as high as 20 million euros -lrb- $ 30.1 million -rrb- and that the city might have to pay two million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- just to get the property back .

the 37-year-old babbel was fired less than 24 hours after stuttgart drew 1-1 with bochum , leaving the swabians in 16th place in the 18-team division with only 12 points from 15 games .
after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .
i did not find it . "

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .
the prime minister has faced charges of bribery , tax fraud and false accounting and has been accused of trying to reform the judicial system to his own ends .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .
the prime minister has faced charges of bribery , tax fraud and false accounting and has been accused of trying to reform the judicial system to his own ends .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .

nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 06.12.2009 austrian sculptor hrdlicka dies after a lifetime of fighting fascism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrdlicka devoted his life to fighting fascism austria 's most famous and politically outspoken sculptor , alfred hrdlicka , has died .
war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the 37-year-old babbel was fired less than 24 hours after stuttgart drew 1-1 with bochum , leaving the swabians in 16th place in the 18-team division with only 12 points from 15 games .
after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .
i did not find it . "
switzerland 's christian gross is to take on babbel 's job , the club confirmed on sunday evening. nk / dpa / reuters / afp editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they 've occupied buildings and held rallies .
but instead of sending in the police , the city is now trying to meet their demands . the name gaengeviertel literally means the neighborhood of passageways .
and that 's exactly what the gaengeviertel in hamburg once was , a dense district of narrow alleys .
there 's very little left of the old gaengeviertel now .
but just west of the showy jungfernstieg waterfront boulevard , shoulder to shoulder with modern office and apartment buildings is a remnant of the neighborhood a bit like it once was .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the gaengeviertel are surrounded by modern buildings this group of twelve run-down buildings has stood mostly empty for years and the city was delighted when an investor willing to foot the bill for the development of the project was found .
dutch investment company hanzevast drew up plans to tear down some of the original buildings , restore the facades of others , and develop a complex of high-end offices and apartment buildings .
but what the city and hanzevast had not realized is that new life had sprouted in the historic neighborhood .
protest movement late in august a group of artists moved into the gaengeviertel to protest the sale and hanzevast 's development plans .
in the dim and musty rooms , they 've set up ateliers , an information center and gallery space .
visitors wander in off the street to take a look at the art hanging on the walls .
" it 's like an oasis here , " said andi barelas , an artist who stencils images onto oil drums that then let the light from a fire inside shine through .
" we 're sitting here between glass and concrete .
but this is a bit of the old city center , which is also very important for hamburg 's history . "
the police never arrived to kick the artists out of the gaengeviertel .
instead the artists ' efforts have won them the sympathy of city officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrance to the gaengeviertel , described by one artist as an " oasis " " very soon after the artists occupied part of the property , the hamburg senate got in contact with the artists and the current investor to see if there was a way to meet in part the demands of the artists , " enno isermann of the city 's office for urban development and the environment told deutsche welle .
he says the city is currently renegotiating the redevelopment deal with hanzevast , looking for a way to preserve more of the original buildings while giving space to the artists to work .
possible solutions include the city buying the property back or hanzevast substantially changing their redevelopment plan .
hanzevast has taken the city to court to force the artists to leave , but rulings thus far have not required the city to do so until the property is officially handed over to the investor in february 2010 .
hanzevast declined to comment for this article .
bringing life back downtown according to isermann , the city 's main goals are to preserve part of the historic area while making room for the artists .
while the calls by artists to create a more diversified downtown area may have struck a chord with hamburg residents , he said those in charge of city planning heard them as well .
" the goal of a big city like hamburg is to make life in the city as colorful and multifaceted as possible , " he said .
" that 's certainly another reason why we are trying to take up the artists ' initiatives , because we 're convinced that a lively city like hamburg must make space for such ideas . "
despite the city 's assertions that it wants to bring a new energy downtown , gaengeviertel spokeswoman christine ebeling is wary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since moving in , artists have provided free cultural events for the city according to her , the only ideas the city has presented about reviving the city center after shops close for the day are fair rides or food and beer that you have to pay for .
she says the artists ' free exhibitions bring something to the downtown area that it lacks .
money is a big issue for the artists .
they are frustrated that the city only values things that will be profitable .
while artists can make money selling their work , both ebeling and fellow artist carl hoffmann argue that the contribution made by the art shown in the gaengeviertel is more cultural than commercial .
" this is not for marketing , " hoffmann said as he took down a show to make room for a classical music concert later that night .
" it 's for experiments and workshops , and getting together with other artists from other cities and maybe other countries . "
the price of creativity but the land the buildings occupy is valuable and could be profitable for investors and developers .
hamburg 's daily abendblatt newspaper reported that renovation costs could run as high as 20 million euros -lrb- $ 30.1 million -rrb- and that the city might have to pay two million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- just to get the property back .
but numbers like these do n't worry ebeling .
" if a company or an investor were to do this , i think they would have to pay a lot of money , " she said .
but the artists have access to a team of volunteers and experience seeking donated materials .
she points out the progress that has already been made on the buildings - a new roof on one , repainted walls on another .
" most of us are good workers , " she says .
" we have an architect , we have city planners and we 've got a lot of craftsmen and craftswomen .
so everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it . "

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .
the prime minister has faced charges of bribery , tax fraud and false accounting and has been accused of trying to reform the judicial system to his own ends .

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .

they 've occupied buildings and held rallies .
but instead of sending in the police , the city is now trying to meet their demands . the name gaengeviertel literally means the neighborhood of passageways .
and that 's exactly what the gaengeviertel in hamburg once was , a dense district of narrow alleys .
there 's very little left of the old gaengeviertel now .
but just west of the showy jungfernstieg waterfront boulevard , shoulder to shoulder with modern office and apartment buildings is a remnant of the neighborhood a bit like it once was .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the remnants of the gaengeviertel are surrounded by modern buildings this group of twelve run-down buildings has stood mostly empty for years and the city was delighted when an investor willing to foot the bill for the development of the project was found .
dutch investment company hanzevast drew up plans to tear down some of the original buildings , restore the facades of others , and develop a complex of high-end offices and apartment buildings .
but what the city and hanzevast had not realized is that new life had sprouted in the historic neighborhood .
protest movement late in august a group of artists moved into the gaengeviertel to protest the sale and hanzevast 's development plans .
in the dim and musty rooms , they 've set up ateliers , an information center and gallery space .
visitors wander in off the street to take a look at the art hanging on the walls .
" it 's like an oasis here , " said andi barelas , an artist who stencils images onto oil drums that then let the light from a fire inside shine through .
" we 're sitting here between glass and concrete .
but this is a bit of the old city center , which is also very important for hamburg 's history . "
the police never arrived to kick the artists out of the gaengeviertel .

he says the city is currently renegotiating the redevelopment deal with hanzevast , looking for a way to preserve more of the original buildings while giving space to the artists to work .
possible solutions include the city buying the property back or hanzevast substantially changing their redevelopment plan .
hanzevast has taken the city to court to force the artists to leave , but rulings thus far have not required the city to do so until the property is officially handed over to the investor in february 2010 .
hanzevast declined to comment for this article .
bringing life back downtown according to isermann , the city 's main goals are to preserve part of the historic area while making room for the artists .
while the calls by artists to create a more diversified downtown area may have struck a chord with hamburg residents , he said those in charge of city planning heard them as well .
" the goal of a big city like hamburg is to make life in the city as colorful and multifaceted as possible , " he said .
" that 's certainly another reason why we are trying to take up the artists ' initiatives , because we 're convinced that a lively city like hamburg must make space for such ideas . "
despite the city 's assertions that it wants to bring a new energy downtown , gaengeviertel spokeswoman christine ebeling is wary .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since moving in , artists have provided free cultural events for the city according to her , the only ideas the city has presented about reviving the city center after shops close for the day are fair rides or food and beer that you have to pay for .
she says the artists ' free exhibitions bring something to the downtown area that it lacks .
money is a big issue for the artists .
they are frustrated that the city only values things that will be profitable .
while artists can make money selling their work , both ebeling and fellow artist carl hoffmann argue that the contribution made by the art shown in the gaengeviertel is more cultural than commercial .
" this is not for marketing , " hoffmann said as he took down a show to make room for a classical music concert later that night .
" it 's for experiments and workshops , and getting together with other artists from other cities and maybe other countries . "
the price of creativity but the land the buildings occupy is valuable and could be profitable for investors and developers .
hamburg 's daily abendblatt newspaper reported that renovation costs could run as high as 20 million euros -lrb- $ 30.1 million -rrb- and that the city might have to pay two million euros -lrb- $ 3 million -rrb- just to get the property back .
but numbers like these do n't worry ebeling .
" if a company or an investor were to do this , i think they would have to pay a lot of money , " she said .
but the artists have access to a team of volunteers and experience seeking donated materials .
she points out the progress that has already been made on the buildings - a new roof on one , repainted walls on another .
" most of us are good workers , " she says .
" we have an architect , we have city planners and we 've got a lot of craftsmen and craftswomen .
so everyone knows what needs to be done and how to do it . "

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .

the 37-year-old babbel was fired less than 24 hours after stuttgart drew 1-1 with bochum , leaving the swabians in 16th place in the 18-team division with only 12 points from 15 games .
after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .

after saturday 's draw , several thousand angry stuttgart fans had gathered outside the club 's mercedes-benz arena to demand babbel 's resignation .
riot police were called in to stop the fans attacking the clubhouse .
two officers were injured and three people were arrested .
stuttgart 's management decided to part with babbel just days ahead of a crucial champions league match .
the club still has the chance to reach the knock-out stages of the lucrative champions league if they beat romanian champions unirea urziceni on wednesday .
stuttgart 's deep fall babbel took over midway through last season , after former stuttgart coach armin veh was fired .
babbel , an ex-national team defender , was off to a good start at stuttgart and even clinched a champions league spot but his luck ran out this season .
stuttgart - like hertha berlin - took a terrific plunge this year after finishing third in the bundesliga last season .
this year has seen a spate of sackings , including hertha berlin 's lucien favre , bochum 's marcel koller and hanover 's dieter hecking .
" i wish the new coaching team all the best , " said babbel , adding " i hope they will find the button and push it so that the team can function again .
i did not find it . "
switzerland 's christian gross is to take on babbel 's job , the club confirmed on sunday evening. nk / dpa / reuters / afp editor : matt zuvela send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .

he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .

maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .

war , suppression and rebellion were recurring themes not only in his art , but also in his political activism . alfred hrdlicka , who was known throughout the german-speaking world both for his strong political views and art , has died at the age of 81 .
his sculptures , drawings and paintings are known as much for their artistic subtlety as their controversial themes .
he is probably best known for the disturbing ' memorial against war and fascism ' , which was unveiled in vienna in 1991 .
one figure in the sculpture is of a jew scrubbing the pavement , bringing back the horrors of austrian national socialism within hitler 's third reich .
hrdlicka was also responsible for a monument to friedrich engels , author of ' the communist manifesto ' in the german city of wuppertal as well as an “ antimemorial ” to a war memorial in hamburg .
comments and criticism hrdlicka 's work and his membership of the communist party provoked both political commentary and social criticism .
the artist , who was said to be instrumental in the formation of germany 's left party , was described by party co-chairman oskar lafontaine as a " secret godfather " of the party .
he had originally intended to be a dental technician but turned towards painting and later to sculpture .
an encounter with mentally ill people in the 1960s led to an initial interest in their suffering and and later to the themes of pain and threat in general .
hrdlicka held professorships at art academies in vienna and the german cities of stuttgart and hamburg .
major exhibitions of his work were held in austria , germany , italy , france , the czech republic and hungary .
opposition to president he publicly opposed former austrian president kurt waldheim , whose nazi past and service as an intelligence officer during the second world war had caused controversy .
hrdlicka remained active until late in life , despite many illnesses .
austrian president heinz fischer paid tribute to the artist for devoting his life to fighting fascism and anti-semitism .
the country 's education and art minister claudia schmied described hrdlicka as " a giant of international art . "
hrdlicka often referred to himself as a " cave man " or " proletarian " of art - uniting in his work the rough and the highly refined. rc / dpa / ap editor : r. balasubramanyam send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it comes as the country 's prime minister faces allegations of connections with the mob . italian police have arrested two of the mafia 's most senior bosses a day after claims that prime minister silvio berlusconi had links with the crime group .
the man believed to be the crime group 's second-in-command , 28-year-old gianni nicchi , was found hiding in an apartment , the italian prime minister told journalists .
at roughly the same time on saturday , milan police arrested third ranked gaetano fidanzati while he was walking along a street in the city .
announcing the arrests , berlusconi appeared to make references to the allegations that had he had helped the mafia and that the organization held the country in its grip .
" this is the best response to all the slander made by irresponsible people who , by doing this , are only slinging mud " at italy , berlusconi said .
testimony allegations the accusations came on friday in the testimony of an ex-mafia member who said that mob chief giuseppe graviano had claimed that berlusconi , in the years before he entered politics , along with his current political ally senator marcello dell 'utri had aided the mafia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlusconi said the arrests were the best answer to mafia-link allegations gaspare spatuzza told a turin court that graviano had said he " got everything thanks to the reliability of these people , " before giving the names of berlusconi and dell 'utri .
he added that graviano said the sicilian mafia had " the country in their hands " .
arrested near to court interior minister roberto maroni told italian television that the hideout where nicchi was arrested was close to palermo 's main court .
maroni said it was thought that nicchi had taken over the number two position last month , after the arrest of domenico raccuglia , who had been running from police for the last 15 years .
nicchi , who is relatively young to be a boss by mafia standards , has been a fugitive since 2006 , and was last year sentenced to 18 years in prison for extortion .
the mafia is now believed to be headed by 51-year-old matteo messina denaro , known as the “ playboy boss ” due to his taste for fast cars , women and gold watches .
the arrests came as up to 90,000 italians protested in rome , calling for berlusconi to resign amid multiple corruption allegations .
