it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .

" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.12.2009 german environment minister blames china , us for climate stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says china does n't want to lead on climate issues while the us can not german environment minister norbert roettgen has lashed out at the us and china , accusing them of thwarting a binding climate agreement at the recently concluded un summit in copenhagen . german environment minister norbert roettgen told the news magazine der spiegel that the chinese were not concerned about climate protection but instead about hindering the process .
he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .

he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .

on saturday eurostar maintained that passenger safety was never compromised during the ordeal and called on eurotunnel to wait until the results of an independent review are released before making accusations .
" we are concerned that eurotunnel has misunderstood the nature of the independent review which has the backing of both the british and french governments … and will establish the truth once and for all , " eurostar said in a statement , urging eurotunnel to " allow the panel of experts to get on with the review and let the facts speak for themselves . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of passengers were stranded at rail stations both sides of the channel some 2,000 passengers were forced to evacuated five eurostar trains after snow in the engine compartments led to short circuits and train breakdowns .
some passengers spent up to 16 hours trapped in the channel tunnel , which runs under the english channel and connects britain with continental europe .
on friday eurotunnel released a statement laying most of the blame for the handling of the incident as well as its cause on eurostar .
" all the evidence shows that eurotunnel was not the cause of the breakdowns and not responsible for eurostar 's customer relations , and that our teams worked quickly and professionally outside of their normal roles , " eurotunnel said .
the company added that the evacuation " was unfortunately extended because the eurostar team , in complete violation of the safety procedures , asked passengers to take their bags with them . "
the breakdowns led eurostar to suspend it 's service for three days , stranding thousands of passengers in london and paris , and led french president nicolas sarkozy to demand an explanation .
the independent inquiry into the breakdowns is to be released late next month. hf / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .

it says it will take gm to court unless the american auto-giant pays up . russia 's sberbank is seeking compensation from general motors to recoup costs from the unsuccessful deal to buy the german carmaker opel .
sberbank head german gref told russian television that he hoped gm would freely agree to restitution .
if the beleaguered us auto company did not agree , sberbank would take legal action , gref said .
" we have formulated all the expenses now and forwarded to the company a proposal on voluntary compensation of the costs , " the ria-novosti news agency quoted gref .
he said the explanations given by gm about the deal 's collapse were insufficient . gm had agreed to sell a majority of opel to canadian-austrian autoparts company magna and its partner sberbank , before deciding not to sell the unit after all and instead to restructure opel itself at the last minute .
the paperwork was ready sberbank had been poised to assume 35 percent of opel , while magna was to take a 20 percent stake .
russia had hoped the deal would provide a needed shot in the arm for its ailing auto industry .
" nine months of talks , 9,000 initialed pages of the contract had been ready for signing , " gref said according to interfax .
" and two days before the deal gm abandoned it . "
sberbank , the largest credit institution in russia , accounts for about a quarter of the aggregate russian banking assets and a third of banking capital .
for 2009 sberbank 's net income decreased to 18.5 billion rubles from 113.2 billion rubles , almost 84 percent year-over-year , according to an 11 month statement of financial highlights based on russian accounting standards sjt / dpa / afp / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 26.12.2009 german environment minister blames china , us for climate stalemate großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : roettgen says china does n't want to lead on climate issues while the us can not german environment minister norbert roettgen has lashed out at the us and china , accusing them of thwarting a binding climate agreement at the recently concluded un summit in copenhagen . german environment minister norbert roettgen told the news magazine der spiegel that the chinese were not concerned about climate protection but instead about hindering the process .
he also said that in the united states , the political elite had not succeeded in winning support for climate protection .
the comments come amid the backdrop of criticism levelled by the german government over the attitude of countries like the us and china following the disappointing outcome at the united nations climate summit in copenhagen earlier this month .
the climate conference of 193 countries agreed merely to " take note " of a new copenhagen accord to fight global climate change , after two weeks of talks in the danish capital .
the accord is not legally binding , and does not commit countries to agree a binding successor to the kyoto protocol .
referring to us president barack obama and the chinese prime minister wen jiabao in particular , the german minister said they had settled for the lowest common denominator .
" china does not want to lead and the united states can not lead , ” roettgen , who belongs to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic party , said .
he said the " low point " of the climate talks came when china failed to accept a unilateral offer by industrialized countries to reduce co2 emissions by at least 80 percent by 2050 .
lashing out at the us , roettgen told the magazine " they only want cheap money for consumption , and do not want to limit their co2 emissions . "
niebel 's appeal to developing nations meanwhile , german development minister dirk niebel called on china and other emerging countries to endorse a binding climate agreement .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate activists had urged for a strong and binding climate treaty in copenhagen in an interview to be published in the monday edition of the hamburger abendblatt newspaper , the minister , who 's from the free democratic party – junior partners to merkel 's conservative bloc – said these countries should realize that germany would not settle for a mere continuation of the kyoto protocol , which is due to run out in 2012 .
kyoto limits the emissions of nearly 40 developed countries from 2008-2012 , but the united states never ratified the protocol and it does not bind the emissions of developing nations .
niebel said china had acted in copenhagen as if they were like other developing countries , while they were in fact among the world 's biggest emitters of greenhouse gases .
niebel called for emissions trading at the global level .
" global warming can best be limited by the instruments of the market economy , " he said .
that way , each country gets a certain amount of carbon credits , niebel pointed out , adding that those who want to emit more , will have to purchase emission rights from other countries .
german government blamed the leader of the green party , juergen trittin , accused environment minister roettgen and chancellor merkel of doing too little to ensure success at the copenhagen summit .
" the federal government has failed , " trittin told the welt am sonntag newspaper .
two more rounds of climate talks are scheduled to be held in bonn and mexico next year , where negotiators hope to nail down what they failed to achieve in copenhagen .
the goal is to complete a signable treaty in mexico city in december 2010 and have it take effect from 2013 , after the current roster of pledges under the kyoto protocol expires. rb / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
