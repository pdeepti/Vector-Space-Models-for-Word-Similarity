european companies want easier access to india ’ s booming economy but one sticking point has been the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in the retail industry .
some western supermarkets are already making their mark .
some customers are happy but ngos fear that millions of jobs could be at risk . there are roughly 12 million small traders in india - they sell everything from spices to shoelaces .
but competition has arrived - in the form of massive foreign supermarkets .
metro , walmart and carrefour all have stores in india ’ s big cities .
some customers are happy about the development - especially those from the middle class , for whom it is a status symbol to be able to shop at a supermarket .
one customer , for example , thinks they are very convenient : “ whatever you want you can get here .
that ’ s why i like big bazaar .
i get all my every household things from here . ” 1 percent of food products sold by supermarkets at the moment , only 1 percent of food products are bought in supermarkets and there are still considerable restrictions on foreign companies .
for example , the german group metro is only allowed to have wholesale stores in cities with over one million inhabitants and to sell products to licensed retailers .
until recently , the sale of fruit and vegetables was banned .
marita wiggerthale , a trade and agriculture expert at oxfam warned that the consequences could be catastrophic if the restrictions were lifted rapidly and without careful regulation policies being put in place to ensure salaries are fair and working conditions are good .
she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .
this has to do with the fact that the gap between the demands of the supermarket chains and the capacities of agricultural smallholdings is widening . ”
government policies have not benefitted population dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , a coalition of trade unions , professional associations and ngos that has been campaigning against the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in india , explained that government policies had not benefitted the whole population .
“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

european companies want easier access to india ’ s booming economy but one sticking point has been the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in the retail industry .
some western supermarkets are already making their mark .
some customers are happy but ngos fear that millions of jobs could be at risk . there are roughly 12 million small traders in india - they sell everything from spices to shoelaces .
but competition has arrived - in the form of massive foreign supermarkets .
metro , walmart and carrefour all have stores in india ’ s big cities .
some customers are happy about the development - especially those from the middle class , for whom it is a status symbol to be able to shop at a supermarket .
one customer , for example , thinks they are very convenient : “ whatever you want you can get here .
that ’ s why i like big bazaar .
i get all my every household things from here . ” 1 percent of food products sold by supermarkets at the moment , only 1 percent of food products are bought in supermarkets and there are still considerable restrictions on foreign companies .
for example , the german group metro is only allowed to have wholesale stores in cities with over one million inhabitants and to sell products to licensed retailers .
until recently , the sale of fruit and vegetables was banned .
marita wiggerthale , a trade and agriculture expert at oxfam warned that the consequences could be catastrophic if the restrictions were lifted rapidly and without careful regulation policies being put in place to ensure salaries are fair and working conditions are good .
she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .
this has to do with the fact that the gap between the demands of the supermarket chains and the capacities of agricultural smallholdings is widening . ”
government policies have not benefitted population dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , a coalition of trade unions , professional associations and ngos that has been campaigning against the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in india , explained that government policies had not benefitted the whole population .
“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

until recently , the sale of fruit and vegetables was banned .
marita wiggerthale , a trade and agriculture expert at oxfam warned that the consequences could be catastrophic if the restrictions were lifted rapidly and without careful regulation policies being put in place to ensure salaries are fair and working conditions are good .
she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .
this has to do with the fact that the gap between the demands of the supermarket chains and the capacities of agricultural smallholdings is widening . ”
government policies have not benefitted population dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , a coalition of trade unions , professional associations and ngos that has been campaigning against the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in india , explained that government policies had not benefitted the whole population .
“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

the disagreement has blocked croatian attempts to join the european union . at the signing ceremony in stockholm on wednesday , the eu commissioner for enlargement , olli rehn , called it " a very good day for slovenia and croatia , and the european union . " the european union has been waiting for the dispute between an existing member and a candidate member to be resolved before it proceeds with croatian accession , although the country is already well on the way to finalizing conditions .
the deal allows international arbitration over the bay of piran in the north adriatic sea , which has been claimed by both countries since they declared independence during the break-up of yugoslavia in 1991 .
access to the sea bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : piran bay : the disputed waters italy controls one edge of the bay and croatia the other . slovenia 's entire coastline , including the fishing town of piran , is in the middle , but it has no access to the sea .
the arbitration tribunal 's ruling will be binding for both countries and will secure slovenian access to international shipping waters .
slovenia agreed not to block croatia joining the eu and that arbitration will only start after croatia has concluded its negotiations .
at the signing ceremony , slovenian prime minister borut pahor told his croatian counterpart jadraka kosor : " the trust between the two of us was of crucial significance .
we overcame the obstacles on the border issues which were too high to reach for negotiations before us . " mll / afp / dpa / / reuters editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround . "
" it is the best decision for britain and our plants , " unite general-secretary tony woodley said .
" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .
but , he warned , although a restructuring plan can cut costs , it can not replace a weak product line. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 04.11.2009 consequences of 1979 hostage crisis still influencing us-iran relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us rhetoric harks back to the time of the 1979 crisis thirty years on from the capture of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students , the consequences of that event still reverberate through iran and its relations with the united states . the latent unease and unrest in iran was once again visible wednesday on the islamic republic 's day of national confrontation against world imperialism - the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students in support of the iranian revolution .
thousands of supporters of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad marked the 30th anniversary of the takeover of the us compound by filling the streets around the closed embassy in a state-organized anti-us rally chanting slogans such as " death to america " and " death to israel . "
nearby , security forces clashed with opposition supporters and anti-ahmadinejad protestors , still smarting from the disputed reelection of the president in june .
the demonstrators , many of whom wore the green colors of failed presidential candidate mir-hossein moussavi , shouted " death to the dictator " as police responded with tear gas .
both sides seemed to be capitalizing on the anniversary of the capture of the us embassy 30 years ago to renew confrontations which may have been suppressed since the weeks of unrest following the presidential elections but have not been eradicated .
significant anniversary for both sides of iranian political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides of the iranian divide mark the anniversary the nov .
4 date holds significance for both sides .
supporters of the regime see the capture of the us embassy as a pivotal event in the rise of the islamic republic and an unprecedented success against the united states .
it remains a source of pride which fuels the belief that a sovereign iran can be strong and independent in the face of us hegemony .
" we continue to hear very hostile rhetoric harking back to the period of the hostage crisis from iran 's leaders , " anthony dworkin , a senior policy fellow and expert on us foreign policy at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" ahmadinejad continues to very much play that card .
the view from outside iran is that ahmadinejad and his support relies on this feeling of intense antagonism between iran and the united states .
people see a vested interest in stoking up these feelings on ahmadinejad 's part . "
for opposition supporters , the anniversary marks the moment when the door to diplomacy and engagement in the world was slammed shut ; a door that moderate iranians hope to force open for the good of the nation , allowing iran to fully rejoin the international community .
" there is a feeling in iran that other regimes would have been more open to engagement and less invested in a stance of hostility towards the west , " dworkin added .
" the moderates would undoubtedly have been more open to negotiations with the us . "
this view was supported recently by iran 's top dissident cleric grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri who said that the capture of the us embassy and the holding of us citizens as hostages was a mistake .
" the occupation of the american embassy at the start had the support of iranian revolutionaries and the late imam khomeini and i supported it too , " he said .
" but considering the negative repercussions and the high sensitivity which was created among the american people and which still exists , it was not the right thing to do .
principally an embassy is part of that country and occupying an embassy of a country which was not at war with us was like declaring a war against that country .
it was not a correct thing . "
hostage crisis continues to color us perception of iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist students stormed the us embassy in tehran certainly the repercussions from the 1979 us hostage crisis rumble on in the current relations between the united states and iran , adding weight to the belief of moderates like montazeri that the event was highly detrimental to iran 's standing not only with the united states but in the wider western world .
" the embassy and hostage crisis on 1979 lay at the roots of the pretty widespread feeling in the united states that iran is a hostile and threatening country and that dates back to the time of the islamic revolution , " dworkin said .
" it still affects they way people in the us feel about iran , even though more recently the whole nuclear issue has colored that , but i think the events around the whole hostage crisis are still resonant in the us because relations have been pretty frozen since then and there has n't really been a chance to set a new tone . "
despite the continuing anti-us rhetoric and the freeze in relations , there have been moves by us president barack obama to reach out to iran through his engagement strategy , a very different foreign agenda to the previous bush administration 's policy of confrontation .
while there have been some counter offers from iran , they fall short of the clear-cut statements that the us is looking for .
the experts believe this has much to do with the complexity of the situation within iran .
obama 's engagement strategy causing unease in tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's strategy puts pressure on ahmadinejad " it 's clear that the us wants to reopen dialogue and we 've seen a lot from obama ; his praise of the iranian people , his shift in language , his constant stressing of the legitimate interests of iran and its dignity , civilization and so on , " said dworkin .
" on the other hand , the political situation in iran is going to make it difficult for the regime to respond positively to that .
domestically , it would be very hard for ahmadinejad to go too far too quickly in responding to the us . "
" obama too is under pressure to show that the engagement strategy is yielding results .
i think there are strong reasons on both sides to pursue an engagement strategy but the political context makes it quite difficult for both countries to spin this out for too much longer . ”
dr. josef braml from the german council on foreign relations believes that obama 's engagement policy could make life more uncomfortable for iran 's current regime and have a detrimental effect on a possible thawing of relations .
" obama offered an open hand , he unclenched his fist but the iranian leadership has bitten it , " braml told deutsche welle .
" for iran , this approach has caused problems because if someone approaches you with a smiling face , he shows the rest of the world that he 's open .
if you 're not willing to accept that then it will be easier for obama to get other countries on board which may have been reluctant to take a stand against iran .
being open and cooperative and not being rewarded for that is an argument for stronger sanctions . "
" but i think there is still a chance of restoring ties by engaging iran and involving iran as part of the solution rather than part of the problem , " braml added .
" this would give the iranian leadership some acknowledgement .
there is no longer any talk about regime change and more talk about how the iranians can be part of international solutions . "

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.11.2009 social service providers fear military conscription cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscripts are a great help to the elderly , ill and disabled in germany the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months will also apply to those who opt to do community service instead .
community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .
we 're talking about rising sea levels , which will also affect germany 's coasts .
so we must not belittle climate change - it will have a massive effect on us . interview : irene quaile -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .

of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .

they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .

against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.11.2009 social service providers fear military conscription cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscripts are a great help to the elderly , ill and disabled in germany the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months will also apply to those who opt to do community service instead .
community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 04.11.2009 new treatments for neglected diseases come from emerging nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs for otherwise neglected diseases could be a market for emerging economies drug companies in emerging nations are well positioned to develop ways to fight dozens of otherwise neglected tropical diseases that affect mainly the poor . peter singer is professor of medicine and the head of the mclaughlin-rotman centre for global health . he talked to deutsche welle about ways to combat dozens of neglected tropical diseases . deutsche welle : why do you think it is vital to step up the fight against neglected tropical diseases ? peter singer : neglected tropical diseases are about 30 diseases that nobody can name - things most people have n't heard of .
but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .
christian von soest is a southern africa expert with the german institute of global and area studies in hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 surprise and anger greet gm decision to keep opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has decided to keep opel political leaders and employees expressed dismay and surprise at the announcement by us carmaker general motors not to sell its european unit , opel . gm 's decision was a blow to german chancellor angela merkel , who was on a visit to washington , and who had in the past strongly supported the move to sell opel to canadian auto parts supplier magna .
in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the clashes come as iran marks the 30th anniversary of the student storming of the us embassy in the capital . several hundred opposition supporters shouting " death to dictators " have gathered in a street in central tehran .
according to media reports , several thousand police used batons and teargas in an attempt to disperse them .
there were also reports that police have fired shots into the crowd , wounding several people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .

analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .

he and five other artists were pioneers in organizing an uncensored exhibition : the first leipzig fall salon . hans-hendrik grimmling was practically born with a paintbrush in his hand .
by 14 , he and a friend had already set up their own studio in grimmling 's hometown zwenkau , near leipzig . the two boys did not just have art on their minds , though .
although they painted , copied works by artists including franz marc , and even sold a couple of pieces , the studio served more as a sanctuary of freedom .
they used the space to drink and throw parties , and would rent the room to young couples in exchange for a glass of beer .
everyone else kept their distance . " it felt great , " recalled grimmling .
" at such a young age , we had already carved a niche and tried to free ourselves from convention . " the soldier with the painting kit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : grimmling , seen here in his studio , is now an art professor in berlin after finishing school , hans-hendrik grimmling joined the national people 's army -lrb- nva -rrb- , as all young men in east germany were required to do .
he later described the experience as the most terrible time of his life , full of humiliation and hidden tears . during his service , grimmling 's painting kit was one of the only personal items he was allowed to keep .
he retreated to his room each night to paint and avoid the problems he faced in the military .
" there , i painted just for myself as an escape and to feel a kind of tenderness .
painting saved me from the reality i faced and helped me survive , " he said . upon completing his military service , grimmling was accepted to east germany 's most renowned university for artists , in leipzig .
he and his classmates gained a reputation for being wild - but also unbelievably productive . " completely strange imagination " grimmling finished his basic studies with werner tuebke , one of the most famous gdr painters , and was accepted along with five other students for the advanced class called " free art . "
it was led by wolfgang mattheuer , another important figure in the leipzig art scene .
mattheuer 's class provided grimmling with an important forum where he could enjoy artistic freedom . however , grimmling was prevented from graduating just before the end of his studies .
the faculty cited his " completely strange imagination " and the influence of " imperialistic decadence " in his work as reasons for his failure .
there was nothing of the proletariat to be found in his paintings , they criticized . faced with expulsion , grimmling accepted an assignment to paint two miners in a piece called " working heroes . "
he explained that he had not yet developed a radically alternative perspective and still wanted the official recognition that a diploma confers . " working heroes " led grimmling to graduate with the grade of " very good " and he was offered a position at the association of visual artists .
the job provided for his basic needs and offered opportunities to take part in state-sponsored art projects and deals . bildunterschrift : " umerziehung der voegel " -lrb- reeducation of the birds -rrb- , by hans-hendrik grimmling , 1978 catching the censors ' attention alongside his official role , however , grimmling was developing his own vision .
he painted birds without wings or with contorted bodies turning in on themselves , while experimenting and testing boundaries with fellow artists . his work began to draw attention from the east german censors .
in particular , a line from a poem he and artist and friend olaf wegewitz posted above a gallery door raised concern .
the line ran " the word ruins the way , " and the censors wondered whether grimmling meant to implicate the ruling sed party . government officials cancelled the gallery 's planned exhibition one day before its opening date and ordered that it be taken down .
the episode frustrated wegewitz and grimmling , who recalled , " we were humiliated , but , at the same time , we felt a sort of pleasure in being able to define ourselves differently and not belong to ' them . " ' beyond the state 's imagination bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " ich in leipzig " -lrb- me in leipzig -rrb- , by hans-hendrik grimmling , 1978 another of grimmling 's exhibits was forbidden a year later , but the artist did not give up .
he sought new ways to exhibit his work , and finally he had a stroke of genius . together with five other artists , grimmling organized the " first leipzig fall salon . "
the 1984 event became the first uncensored exhibition to take place in east germany . due to their membership in the association of visual artists , grimmling and fellow painter guenther huniat were able to rent a space for the exhibit from a government agency in leipzig .
the state officials could n't imagine that the artists were not planning to show official works from the association , but their own independent creations . eventually , the stasi - the east german secret police - caught wind of the group 's plans and documented the work of grimmling and his peers as hostile and negative .
security officials wondered , however , whether banning the exhibition would draw too much attention to the artists . in light of these concerns , the exhibit was allowed to take place but with an important proviso : no more than six visitors could see the exhibition daily .
nevertheless , the show was a hit and attracted more than 10,000 visitors in the course of four weeks . a threat to communism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mauerbild " -lrb- picture of the wall -rrb- , by hans-hendrik grimmling , 1983 despite the exhibition 's success , it proved to be a defeat for grimmling .
it became clear to him that the state would never permit a second installment of the fall salon .
this conclusion led him to a significant decision : he filed an official request to be allowed to travel out of east germany . the stasi file on grimmling reveals that he was viewed as a lost cause who could not be won back for the good of society .
as such , grimmling 's request to leave the country was processed and approved in an unusually quick manner . in 1986 , the artist traveled into west berlin , together with his wife and young daughter .
they lived with friends while grimmling created a makeshift studio and began to paint with limited materials on packing paper from a hardware store .
he was also able to sell a few paintings left over from his time in leipzig . moving forward in berlin gradually , grimmling established himself more and more in west berlin .
he had begun offering painting courses by 1988 .
in 2001 , he became a lecturer and later a professor at the technical university for art in berlin . he said of his work there , " now and again , i try to explain to my students that it makes sense and can even bring a kind of joy to get mixed up in things that you think might be manipulated .
and even after the fall of the wall , there 's still plenty of manipulation . " author : nadine wojcik -lrb- gw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.11.2009 social service providers fear military conscription cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscripts are a great help to the elderly , ill and disabled in germany the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months will also apply to those who opt to do community service instead .
community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround .

" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround . "
" it is the best decision for britain and our plants , " unite general-secretary tony woodley said .
" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .
but , he warned , although a restructuring plan can cut costs , it can not replace a weak product line. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "

the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .
we 're talking about rising sea levels , which will also affect germany 's coasts .
so we must not belittle climate change - it will have a massive effect on us . interview : irene quaile -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 04.11.2009 consequences of 1979 hostage crisis still influencing us-iran relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us rhetoric harks back to the time of the 1979 crisis thirty years on from the capture of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students , the consequences of that event still reverberate through iran and its relations with the united states . the latent unease and unrest in iran was once again visible wednesday on the islamic republic 's day of national confrontation against world imperialism - the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students in support of the iranian revolution .
thousands of supporters of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad marked the 30th anniversary of the takeover of the us compound by filling the streets around the closed embassy in a state-organized anti-us rally chanting slogans such as " death to america " and " death to israel . "
nearby , security forces clashed with opposition supporters and anti-ahmadinejad protestors , still smarting from the disputed reelection of the president in june .
the demonstrators , many of whom wore the green colors of failed presidential candidate mir-hossein moussavi , shouted " death to the dictator " as police responded with tear gas .
both sides seemed to be capitalizing on the anniversary of the capture of the us embassy 30 years ago to renew confrontations which may have been suppressed since the weeks of unrest following the presidential elections but have not been eradicated .
significant anniversary for both sides of iranian political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides of the iranian divide mark the anniversary the nov .
4 date holds significance for both sides .
supporters of the regime see the capture of the us embassy as a pivotal event in the rise of the islamic republic and an unprecedented success against the united states .
it remains a source of pride which fuels the belief that a sovereign iran can be strong and independent in the face of us hegemony .
" we continue to hear very hostile rhetoric harking back to the period of the hostage crisis from iran 's leaders , " anthony dworkin , a senior policy fellow and expert on us foreign policy at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" ahmadinejad continues to very much play that card .
the view from outside iran is that ahmadinejad and his support relies on this feeling of intense antagonism between iran and the united states .
people see a vested interest in stoking up these feelings on ahmadinejad 's part . "
for opposition supporters , the anniversary marks the moment when the door to diplomacy and engagement in the world was slammed shut ; a door that moderate iranians hope to force open for the good of the nation , allowing iran to fully rejoin the international community .
" there is a feeling in iran that other regimes would have been more open to engagement and less invested in a stance of hostility towards the west , " dworkin added .
" the moderates would undoubtedly have been more open to negotiations with the us . "
this view was supported recently by iran 's top dissident cleric grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri who said that the capture of the us embassy and the holding of us citizens as hostages was a mistake .
" the occupation of the american embassy at the start had the support of iranian revolutionaries and the late imam khomeini and i supported it too , " he said .
" but considering the negative repercussions and the high sensitivity which was created among the american people and which still exists , it was not the right thing to do .
principally an embassy is part of that country and occupying an embassy of a country which was not at war with us was like declaring a war against that country .
it was not a correct thing . "
hostage crisis continues to color us perception of iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist students stormed the us embassy in tehran certainly the repercussions from the 1979 us hostage crisis rumble on in the current relations between the united states and iran , adding weight to the belief of moderates like montazeri that the event was highly detrimental to iran 's standing not only with the united states but in the wider western world .
" the embassy and hostage crisis on 1979 lay at the roots of the pretty widespread feeling in the united states that iran is a hostile and threatening country and that dates back to the time of the islamic revolution , " dworkin said .
" it still affects they way people in the us feel about iran , even though more recently the whole nuclear issue has colored that , but i think the events around the whole hostage crisis are still resonant in the us because relations have been pretty frozen since then and there has n't really been a chance to set a new tone . "
despite the continuing anti-us rhetoric and the freeze in relations , there have been moves by us president barack obama to reach out to iran through his engagement strategy , a very different foreign agenda to the previous bush administration 's policy of confrontation .
while there have been some counter offers from iran , they fall short of the clear-cut statements that the us is looking for .
the experts believe this has much to do with the complexity of the situation within iran .
obama 's engagement strategy causing unease in tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's strategy puts pressure on ahmadinejad " it 's clear that the us wants to reopen dialogue and we 've seen a lot from obama ; his praise of the iranian people , his shift in language , his constant stressing of the legitimate interests of iran and its dignity , civilization and so on , " said dworkin .
" on the other hand , the political situation in iran is going to make it difficult for the regime to respond positively to that .
domestically , it would be very hard for ahmadinejad to go too far too quickly in responding to the us . "
" obama too is under pressure to show that the engagement strategy is yielding results .
i think there are strong reasons on both sides to pursue an engagement strategy but the political context makes it quite difficult for both countries to spin this out for too much longer . ”
dr. josef braml from the german council on foreign relations believes that obama 's engagement policy could make life more uncomfortable for iran 's current regime and have a detrimental effect on a possible thawing of relations .
" obama offered an open hand , he unclenched his fist but the iranian leadership has bitten it , " braml told deutsche welle .
" for iran , this approach has caused problems because if someone approaches you with a smiling face , he shows the rest of the world that he 's open .
if you 're not willing to accept that then it will be easier for obama to get other countries on board which may have been reluctant to take a stand against iran .
being open and cooperative and not being rewarded for that is an argument for stronger sanctions . "
" but i think there is still a chance of restoring ties by engaging iran and involving iran as part of the solution rather than part of the problem , " braml added .
" this would give the iranian leadership some acknowledgement .
there is no longer any talk about regime change and more talk about how the iranians can be part of international solutions . "

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 should germany be surprised by gm 's opel decision ? großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a statue of opel founder adam opel in ruesselsheim .
gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundeswehr -pipe- 04.11.2009 social service providers fear military conscription cuts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : conscripts are a great help to the elderly , ill and disabled in germany the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months will also apply to those who opt to do community service instead .
community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 04.11.2009 new treatments for neglected diseases come from emerging nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs for otherwise neglected diseases could be a market for emerging economies drug companies in emerging nations are well positioned to develop ways to fight dozens of otherwise neglected tropical diseases that affect mainly the poor . peter singer is professor of medicine and the head of the mclaughlin-rotman centre for global health . he talked to deutsche welle about ways to combat dozens of neglected tropical diseases . deutsche welle : why do you think it is vital to step up the fight against neglected tropical diseases ? peter singer : neglected tropical diseases are about 30 diseases that nobody can name - things most people have n't heard of .
but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .

opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .

spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 04.11.2009 consequences of 1979 hostage crisis still influencing us-iran relations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : anti-us rhetoric harks back to the time of the 1979 crisis thirty years on from the capture of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students , the consequences of that event still reverberate through iran and its relations with the united states . the latent unease and unrest in iran was once again visible wednesday on the islamic republic 's day of national confrontation against world imperialism - the anniversary of the 1979 seizure of the us embassy in tehran by islamist students in support of the iranian revolution .
thousands of supporters of iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad marked the 30th anniversary of the takeover of the us compound by filling the streets around the closed embassy in a state-organized anti-us rally chanting slogans such as " death to america " and " death to israel . "
nearby , security forces clashed with opposition supporters and anti-ahmadinejad protestors , still smarting from the disputed reelection of the president in june .
the demonstrators , many of whom wore the green colors of failed presidential candidate mir-hossein moussavi , shouted " death to the dictator " as police responded with tear gas .
both sides seemed to be capitalizing on the anniversary of the capture of the us embassy 30 years ago to renew confrontations which may have been suppressed since the weeks of unrest following the presidential elections but have not been eradicated .
significant anniversary for both sides of iranian political divide bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both sides of the iranian divide mark the anniversary the nov .
4 date holds significance for both sides .
supporters of the regime see the capture of the us embassy as a pivotal event in the rise of the islamic republic and an unprecedented success against the united states .
it remains a source of pride which fuels the belief that a sovereign iran can be strong and independent in the face of us hegemony .
" we continue to hear very hostile rhetoric harking back to the period of the hostage crisis from iran 's leaders , " anthony dworkin , a senior policy fellow and expert on us foreign policy at the european council on foreign relations , told deutsche welle .
" ahmadinejad continues to very much play that card .
the view from outside iran is that ahmadinejad and his support relies on this feeling of intense antagonism between iran and the united states .
people see a vested interest in stoking up these feelings on ahmadinejad 's part . "
for opposition supporters , the anniversary marks the moment when the door to diplomacy and engagement in the world was slammed shut ; a door that moderate iranians hope to force open for the good of the nation , allowing iran to fully rejoin the international community .
" there is a feeling in iran that other regimes would have been more open to engagement and less invested in a stance of hostility towards the west , " dworkin added .
" the moderates would undoubtedly have been more open to negotiations with the us . "
this view was supported recently by iran 's top dissident cleric grand ayatollah hossein ali montazeri who said that the capture of the us embassy and the holding of us citizens as hostages was a mistake .
" the occupation of the american embassy at the start had the support of iranian revolutionaries and the late imam khomeini and i supported it too , " he said .
" but considering the negative repercussions and the high sensitivity which was created among the american people and which still exists , it was not the right thing to do .
principally an embassy is part of that country and occupying an embassy of a country which was not at war with us was like declaring a war against that country .
it was not a correct thing . "
hostage crisis continues to color us perception of iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : islamist students stormed the us embassy in tehran certainly the repercussions from the 1979 us hostage crisis rumble on in the current relations between the united states and iran , adding weight to the belief of moderates like montazeri that the event was highly detrimental to iran 's standing not only with the united states but in the wider western world .
" the embassy and hostage crisis on 1979 lay at the roots of the pretty widespread feeling in the united states that iran is a hostile and threatening country and that dates back to the time of the islamic revolution , " dworkin said .
" it still affects they way people in the us feel about iran , even though more recently the whole nuclear issue has colored that , but i think the events around the whole hostage crisis are still resonant in the us because relations have been pretty frozen since then and there has n't really been a chance to set a new tone . "
despite the continuing anti-us rhetoric and the freeze in relations , there have been moves by us president barack obama to reach out to iran through his engagement strategy , a very different foreign agenda to the previous bush administration 's policy of confrontation .
while there have been some counter offers from iran , they fall short of the clear-cut statements that the us is looking for .
the experts believe this has much to do with the complexity of the situation within iran .
obama 's engagement strategy causing unease in tehran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama 's strategy puts pressure on ahmadinejad " it 's clear that the us wants to reopen dialogue and we 've seen a lot from obama ; his praise of the iranian people , his shift in language , his constant stressing of the legitimate interests of iran and its dignity , civilization and so on , " said dworkin .
" on the other hand , the political situation in iran is going to make it difficult for the regime to respond positively to that .
domestically , it would be very hard for ahmadinejad to go too far too quickly in responding to the us . "
" obama too is under pressure to show that the engagement strategy is yielding results .
i think there are strong reasons on both sides to pursue an engagement strategy but the political context makes it quite difficult for both countries to spin this out for too much longer . ”
dr. josef braml from the german council on foreign relations believes that obama 's engagement policy could make life more uncomfortable for iran 's current regime and have a detrimental effect on a possible thawing of relations .
" obama offered an open hand , he unclenched his fist but the iranian leadership has bitten it , " braml told deutsche welle .
" for iran , this approach has caused problems because if someone approaches you with a smiling face , he shows the rest of the world that he 's open .
if you 're not willing to accept that then it will be easier for obama to get other countries on board which may have been reluctant to take a stand against iran .
being open and cooperative and not being rewarded for that is an argument for stronger sanctions . "
" but i think there is still a chance of restoring ties by engaging iran and involving iran as part of the solution rather than part of the problem , " braml added .
" this would give the iranian leadership some acknowledgement .
there is no longer any talk about regime change and more talk about how the iranians can be part of international solutions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .
we 're talking about rising sea levels , which will also affect germany 's coasts .
so we must not belittle climate change - it will have a massive effect on us . interview : irene quaile -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .
we 're talking about rising sea levels , which will also affect germany 's coasts .
so we must not belittle climate change - it will have a massive effect on us . interview : irene quaile -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 gm-run opel will still need government cash großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm may ask spain , where opel has factories , to help fund its restructuring plans general motors says it will cost three billion euros to restructure opel and it did n't say where the money will come from .
analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .

the company added that " harsh economic realities had taken an adverse effect " on the carmaker and that it needed to " cut costs and focus on its core business . "

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.11.2009 surprise and anger greet gm decision to keep opel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm has decided to keep opel political leaders and employees expressed dismay and surprise at the announcement by us carmaker general motors not to sell its european unit , opel . gm 's decision was a blow to german chancellor angela merkel , who was on a visit to washington , and who had in the past strongly supported the move to sell opel to canadian auto parts supplier magna .
in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround . "
" it is the best decision for britain and our plants , " unite general-secretary tony woodley said .
" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .
but , he warned , although a restructuring plan can cut costs , it can not replace a weak product line. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround . "
" it is the best decision for britain and our plants , " unite general-secretary tony woodley said .
" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .
but , he warned , although a restructuring plan can cut costs , it can not replace a weak product line. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deutsche welle takes a look back at the on-again , off-again process . in 1862 the young german entrepreneur adam opel set himself up as a sewing machine manufacturer in rüsselheim .
his business went from strength to strength and in 1886 , opel branched out into bicycles , followed by motor cars three years later .

under gm 's management , opel continued to thrive .
by 1972 , it had a market share of 20.4 percent , making it germany 's leading car manufacturer .
but almost two decades later , its fortunes had turned .
the 1990s the first gulf war ushers in a period of unstable oil prices with long-time repercussions for opel .
from this point on , opel 's growth never really regains momentum .
under manager jose ignacio lopez , opel gets a reputation for bad design and slow performance .

deutsche welle takes a look back at the on-again , off-again process . in 1862 the young german entrepreneur adam opel set himself up as a sewing machine manufacturer in rüsselheim .
his business went from strength to strength and in 1886 , opel branched out into bicycles , followed by motor cars three years later .
in 1929 , us car manufacturing giant gm motors acquired 80 percent of opel shares , and in 1931 , it bought the remaining 20 percent .
under gm 's management , opel continued to thrive .
by 1972 , it had a market share of 20.4 percent , making it germany 's leading car manufacturer .
but almost two decades later , its fortunes had turned .
the 1990s the first gulf war ushers in a period of unstable oil prices with long-time repercussions for opel .
from this point on , opel 's growth never really regains momentum .

european companies want easier access to india ’ s booming economy but one sticking point has been the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in the retail industry .
some western supermarkets are already making their mark .
some customers are happy but ngos fear that millions of jobs could be at risk . there are roughly 12 million small traders in india - they sell everything from spices to shoelaces .
but competition has arrived - in the form of massive foreign supermarkets .
metro , walmart and carrefour all have stores in india ’ s big cities .
some customers are happy about the development - especially those from the middle class , for whom it is a status symbol to be able to shop at a supermarket .
one customer , for example , thinks they are very convenient : “ whatever you want you can get here .
that ’ s why i like big bazaar .
i get all my every household things from here . ” 1 percent of food products sold by supermarkets at the moment , only 1 percent of food products are bought in supermarkets and there are still considerable restrictions on foreign companies .
for example , the german group metro is only allowed to have wholesale stores in cities with over one million inhabitants and to sell products to licensed retailers .
until recently , the sale of fruit and vegetables was banned .
marita wiggerthale , a trade and agriculture expert at oxfam warned that the consequences could be catastrophic if the restrictions were lifted rapidly and without careful regulation policies being put in place to ensure salaries are fair and working conditions are good .
she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .
this has to do with the fact that the gap between the demands of the supermarket chains and the capacities of agricultural smallholdings is widening . ”
government policies have not benefitted population dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , a coalition of trade unions , professional associations and ngos that has been campaigning against the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in india , explained that government policies had not benefitted the whole population .
“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .

unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 04.11.2009 supermarkets invade india großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's metro group already has five megastores in india the european union has been negotiating a free trade deal with india since 2007 .
european companies want easier access to india ’ s booming economy but one sticking point has been the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in the retail industry .
some western supermarkets are already making their mark .
some customers are happy but ngos fear that millions of jobs could be at risk . there are roughly 12 million small traders in india - they sell everything from spices to shoelaces .
but competition has arrived - in the form of massive foreign supermarkets .
metro , walmart and carrefour all have stores in india ’ s big cities .
some customers are happy about the development - especially those from the middle class , for whom it is a status symbol to be able to shop at a supermarket .
one customer , for example , thinks they are very convenient : “ whatever you want you can get here .
that ’ s why i like big bazaar .
i get all my every household things from here . ” 1 percent of food products sold by supermarkets at the moment , only 1 percent of food products are bought in supermarkets and there are still considerable restrictions on foreign companies .
for example , the german group metro is only allowed to have wholesale stores in cities with over one million inhabitants and to sell products to licensed retailers .
until recently , the sale of fruit and vegetables was banned .
marita wiggerthale , a trade and agriculture expert at oxfam warned that the consequences could be catastrophic if the restrictions were lifted rapidly and without careful regulation policies being put in place to ensure salaries are fair and working conditions are good .
she did not think that small farmers would benefit at all from a freeing up of the market : “ the problem is that supermarket chains tend to work with bigger and medium-sized companies .
this has to do with the fact that the gap between the demands of the supermarket chains and the capacities of agricultural smallholdings is widening . ”
government policies have not benefitted population dharmendra kumar , the director of india fdi watch , a coalition of trade unions , professional associations and ngos that has been campaigning against the liberalisation of foreign direct investment in india , explained that government policies had not benefitted the whole population .
“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 04.11.2009 indian education sector to expand großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : top universities such as cambridge hope to open campuses in india india will soon be opening up its education sector to foreign universities and allowing them to open up campuses .
top institutions such as yale , princeton and cambridge are lining up to court indian students on their home turf . for years now , india has been sending its best and brightest students to study at foreign universities .
according to the national knowledge commission of india , more than 160,000 indian students are currently enrolled in colleges and universities abroad , paying fees of roughly four billion us dollars .
every seventh foreign student at university in the united states is an indian .
now , the government is planning to open up india ’ s heavily-regulated educational sector to foreign universities in order to stem the brain drain .
transformation of the education sector human resources development minister kapil sibal said the move would transform the education sector : “ if you are spending 20 million us dollars by sending your children out , you can transform the education sector by investing 20 million us dollars into it . ”
he explained that that it was important “ to open up the education sector to greater investments and to allow children to go to the school they want without any concern about where the money is from ” by putting in place a loan scheme .
in terms of enrolment , india has the third-largest higher education system in the world - after china and the us .
there are 10 million students enrolled at over 400 universities and nearly 21,000 colleges .
huge investment is needed if the government is to achieve its target of 21 million students by 2012 .
world-class educational hub the government is keen for india to become a world-class educational hub with access to global institutions .
it especially wants to create a pool of skilled managers to secure its economic future .
it is determined to take advantage of the strength of its youth , as the average age of citizens in other nations is much higher .
prof sanjay srivastava from the institute of economic growth thought it was more important to ensure the learning environment was appropriate : “ one of the key concerns is that what we do not really need so many harvards or yales but universities that are suited to indian conditions . ”
students are excited siddarth misra , a student who now studies in the us , is excited about the proposal to open up the education sector : “ i think it is great for india .
the brain drain - all the students who were leaving india for jobs and opportunities overseas can come back . ”
“ there will be more opportunity here as well as foreign students having the opportunity to come to india as an emerging market .
there is a lot going on and it ’ s an exciting place to be .
i know for myself that if i had the opportunity to come to india and study in an american institution i would definitely look into that . ”
the legislation still needs to be approved by indian parliament and the government also has to ease regulatory roadblocks and find a way to make education a financially viable business for all concerned .
but once that is done , many more indian students will be able to stay at home to study .

“ the growth that india witnessed did create some kind of middle class but it also created , on the other hand , a vast majority of extremely poor people and pushed them further into extreme poverty .
unemployment pushed people out of agriculture and since there was a process of deindustrialisation going on people couldn ’ t find another job other than retail , other than selling groceries on the streets . ”
thus , if the supermarkets take their business , small traders who sell groceries on the streets might not be able to find other jobs at all .
however , not all customers are embracing the supermarkets . a woman insisted she would continue to buy her fruit and vegetables from her local , familiar trader : “ i find it more convenient .
at big bazaar there is normally a long queue .
if i have about ten minutes to pick up fruit , it ’ s much quicker here and the quality is better . ”
in the end , quality is one of the few weapons india 's small traders have to ensure that global recession , supermarkets and liberalisation policies do not take away their customers .

deutsche welle takes a look back at the on-again , off-again process . in 1862 the young german entrepreneur adam opel set himself up as a sewing machine manufacturer in rüsselheim .
his business went from strength to strength and in 1886 , opel branched out into bicycles , followed by motor cars three years later .

deutsche welle takes a look back at the on-again , off-again process . in 1862 the young german entrepreneur adam opel set himself up as a sewing machine manufacturer in rüsselheim .
his business went from strength to strength and in 1886 , opel branched out into bicycles , followed by motor cars three years later .

the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .

the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .

we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .

of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .

the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "

but wolfsburg took a step towards qualification with a win in turkey . germany 's most decorated football team suffered a shock defeat at home on tuesday , going down 2-0 to girondins bordeaux , who earned qualification to the champions league knockout stages .
yoann gourcuff opened the scoring after 37 minutes and marouane chamakh added a late second to guarantee bordeaux , with 10 points , a top two finish in group a. juventus are second on eight points after a 1-0 win at maccabi haifa , leaving bayern in third spot and facing a battle to qualify .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : girondins bordeaux scored once in each half bayern , with striker luca toni partnering miroslav klose up front instead of mario gomez , missed a few good chances in the first half and hit the post through edson braafheid in the third minute .
in a goalmouth scramble later in the game , michael ciani cleared a klose shot off the line , although television replays showed the bordeaux player had touched the ball with his hand .
" these details decide games .
we were n't lucky , but we were n't good enough either , " admitted bayern manager louis van gaal after the game .
" in a top game it is always important to get a goal , " he added , before focussing on the bavarian team 's only glimmer of hope : " we 're not out yet , we still have a small chance . "

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

community groups warn of exploding costs and cuts to social services . many of the organizations that provide social services in germany are worried about the german government 's plans to cut military conscription to six months from nine months .
they rely on the 70,000 young men who opt out of service with the armed forces , the bundeswehr , in favor of doing community service for non-profit organizations across germany .
but come january 2011 , when those doing what is called " civilian service " are only bound for six months , there could be a shortage of caregivers .
" disabled people and those requiring special care will suffer , " said ulrike mascher , head of the largest german social service provider , sozialverband vdk , with 1.4 million members .
" many are able to study only because there are young men doing community service who accompany them to school or university , " she said .
" it 's going to be hard if they have to train and get used to someone new every six months . "
mascher said costs would likely skyrocket when the number of people doing community service in lieu of military service drops .
she fears services will be cut if donors or the german state do not provide more money .
" all organizations offering care will have to adapt to the change .
costs will increase and we are going to need more money . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the red cross will offer less training if conscription is shortened high costs , less training the red cross , which relies on a large army of young men doing community service , has also begun rethinking its employment strategy in view of the shortened conscription period .
" it wo n't be worth training them anymore if they only have to serve for six months , " said gabrielle thivissen , head of administration at the red cross in the state of north-rhine westphalia .
around 850 young men currently perform community service for the north-rhine westphalia branch , a quarter of whom are assigned to emergency services .
their basic training alone takes three months .
" we just wo n't be putting any of these young men in this particular area anymore , " thivissen said , adding that in future many of the young men will be assigned less interesting jobs , for example , as porters or storehouse packers .
" many of our units have already signaled that they 'll assign new conscripts to simple jobs , " she said .
" because that work is dull , we expect to attract fewer people for community service altogether . "
cheap labor thivissen said it makes no economic sense to place highly trained , expensive personnel in jobs that conscripts - whose labor costs are very low - have been carrying out until now , such as spending time talking with the elderly , ill and disabled .
the entire system of social services was under threat , she said , adding that care for the elderly was expensive and the numbers of those who needed care was increasing . furthermore , few people seek a career in the field .
" we find that -lsb- the conscripts -rsb- often enjoy this work , " thivissen said .
" after having done it for nine months , quite a few stay on once their official term is over .
they either go on to do voluntary work , or they make it their job .
all that will disappear . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 04.11.2009 neighbors to put pressure on zimbabwe 's leadership großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zimbabwe 's president robert mugabe , left and prime minister morgan tsvangirai are under pressure to make their power-sharing deal work a regional summit on thursday will attempt to break the political deadlock in zimbabwe .
in an interview with deutsche welle , africa expert christian von soest warns against high expectations . how can the leaders of mozambique , swaziland and zambia contribute to a political solution in zimbabwe ?
is there anything they can do ?
christian von soest : they could put more pressure on president robert mugabe and his party zanu-pf in an effort to bring them back to the global political agreement .
that was also the main goal of prime minister morgan tsvangirai , i think , when he suspended his cooperation with zanu-pf in the unity government . do zimbabwe 's neighbors have more than mere diplomatic tools ?
their tools are rather limited .
mugabe knows very well that the southern africa development community -lrb- sadc -rrb- pressured tsvangirai into this global political agreement between his own movement of democratic change -lrb- mdc -rrb- and zanu-pf .
so mugabe may not expect too much pressure himself from the sadc , nor from the main regional power : south african president jacob zuma was very vocal about zimbabwe before he was elected , but has turned rather quiet since .
it sounds a bit as if this summit wo n't make a big difference at all .
at the moment it is hard to see a new approach .
it 's hard to tell , but i 'm rather sceptic , whether there will be any progress .
on the other hand tsvangirai 's move to suspend the cooperation with zanu-pf is a reason for the sadc to talk to mugabe and try to make him return to the main agreement .
just last week president mugabe refused un torture expert manfred nowak entry to the country because nowak had been invited officially by prime minister tsvangirai .
does that show who really is in power in zimbabwe ?
it does indeed .
but there is more .
it shows that mugabe and his zanu-pf still control the security forces - police , intelligence , the army .
this incident shows that mugabe is still in command .
it 's not the first time something like this happened .
a year ago , a group of elder statesmen , amongst them former un secretary general kofi annan and former us president jimmy carter , were refused entry into zimbabwe .
so this has happened before .
but looking at the economic policy , despite the fact that mugabe reappointed the central bank governor , gideon gono , there is more influence from the mdc .
is it known how mugabe and tsvangirai communicate with one another ?
do n't they inform each other , e.g. about whom they invite to visit the country ?
when morgan tsvangirai was in germany recently , we asked him that question - how is cooperation on a day-to-day basis .
he said it was working quite well .
and i read that both mugabe and tsvangirai met a couple of days ago for some hours , but that was the first time in weeks that they had a personal encounter .
so i think communication between both is quite limited and dominated by mistrust .
does that also explain morgan tsvangirai 's partial withdrawal from the unity government last month ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the sadc have urged tsvangirai to end his boycott of the unity government tsvangirai realises that mugabe is trying to outsmart him and that the president wants to really govern the country .
with his move tsvangirai wants to draw the attention of the sadc and western countries and to express the need of pressure and intervention from the outside in order to make zanu-pf and mugabe respect the global political agreement .
at the same time the sadc does n't seem to be happy with tsvangirai 's move .
they even urged him to stop his boycott .
there is a pattern behind that .
when it was led by south africa , the sadc also tried to push tsvangirai into the global political agreement .
it is a fact that mugabe still has a very strong stand in the sadc , while there is no strong support from the sadc for the mdc .
so apart from botswana which has openly criticized mugabe they have a rather ambivalent position .
sadc chairman , democratic republic of congo 's president joseph kabila , is trying to mediate in zimbabwe as well .
how big is his influence on mugabe and tsvangirai ?
kabila himself says he is optimistic .
well , i 'm not so optimistic .
i can not imagine how kabila as a relatively new leader could tell mugabe , one of the liberation heroes in southern africa , what to do .
mugabe is the oldest president in southern africa .
also between former south african president mbeki as sadc chairman and mugabe there was this hierarchy .
it is n't any different with kabila .
in africa mugabe is still respected and hard to approach or even be criticised .
neither can i see the sadc change its position on zimbabwe at the moment .
that may happen one day , but at the moment i ca n't see any signs indicating progress .
at the same time the political deadlock is a barrier for economic recovery , zimbabwe 's most pressing problem .
yes - and one must also recognize that there has been some progress , like the introduction of the us dollar as the de facto currency .
civil servants are being paid now .
inflation has been reduced .
it is a fact though that these small achievements are now at risk .
the key really is cooperation within the unity government .
could it be that the political deadlock remains until the next elections ?
everything is possible , but i understand from some mdc representatives that if there is no solution within the next couple of weeks or months , that they want new elections . i really can not imagine how that should work at the moment .
the solution from my point of view must come from somewhere else , and the sadc is the only key player i can see around .
they must put more pressure on mugabe , because it looks as if his zanu-pf is not prepared to share power , and as if the mdc and tsvangirai are n't strong enough to force them to do so .
pressure from outside could make the difference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 04.11.2009 industrialized countries should set climate protection example , says expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some countries are reluctant to sacrifice industrial growth for the sake of the climate as a key climate conference in copenhagen nears , some nations are still showing little willingness to reach an agreement to protect the earth .
the usa , in particular , needs to change its tune , a german expert told dw . professor mojib latif is a climate expert at the leibniz-institute of marine sciences at the university of kiel .
he told deutsche welle about his expectations and doubts regarding the upcoming climate conference in the danish capital . deutsche welle : how do you rate climate change as a challenge to humankind at this point in time ? mojib latif : at the moment , we 're at the beginning of climate development .
we can already prove there is human influence on the climate , but the warming is around 0.7 degrees celsius over the last 100 years .
that 's very little by comparison with what could be ahead of us - possibly up to 4 degrees celsius by the end of the century if we do n't turn around and just keep on the way we are going . what action needs to be taken ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions are a worldwide problem it 's important that all over the world we halve emissions of greenhouse gases - especially co2 - by the middle of the century , and then reduce them by around 80 percent by the end of the century .
of course the industrialized countries have to make a bigger effort than the developing countries . the barcelona talks are the last preparatory round for the un climate conference in copenhagen .
what role do these international conferences play when it comes to reaching international agreement ? i think international conferences are important with regard to gaining public attention .
ultimately that 's where the leaders of this world will presumably come together to reach some final agreement on the climate .
i hope copenhagen will mark the start of a long-term strategy to protect the climate . how optimistic are you ? at the moment , all the signs indicate that a lot of countries are still blocking , but i hope that the political skill of some of the actors will help to bring about a sensible result . how do you rate the willingness of germany and the willingness of key countries like india and china to sign a far-reaching , binding agreement ? so far the leading industrial countries have not been credible .
they are the ones who bear the most responsibility for the problem .
but they are not willing to adopt really bold targets , especially the usa .
against that background , it 's understandable that emerging countries like china and india are still holding back with climate protection measures .
but that will change instantly if the usa really gives a clear signal and agrees to some courageous emissions targets in copenhagen . at the moment , there is a lot of pessimism to be heard .
you could almost get the impression that some countries and lobby groups are preparing us for the conference 's failure .
how serious would the situation be if there 's no binding agreement after the copenhagen talks ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : where people have more money , there 's more pollution i would consider it absolutely disastrous if there were to be no final protocol in copenhagen , because we have already waited too long .
the kyoto protocol was n't even kept to - the usa in particular did n't even ratify it .
we only have a very small timeframe to act and any further delay is unacceptable . what can ordinary consumers do ? ordinary consumers here also have no credibility abroad .
for instance , a german emits between 10 and 11 tons of co2 per year on average , an indian only 1 .
so we have to try to reduce our per-capita emissions in germany and in other industrialized countries considerably .
that 's the only way we can attain credibility .
the long-term goal has to be something like " carbon justice . "
every human being in the world should have the same right to emit co2 . you can do a lot of things yourself .
ultimately , sustainable climate protection means restructuring the world 's economy in the direction of renewable energies .
every individual can make his or her own contribution today , whether it 's driving a smaller car , insulating their home or putting solar cells on their roof .
or you can cut down on overseas travel . a lot of people see climate change as something that wo n't affect them directly .
how is climate change affecting germany and what dangers are still coming ? climate change will have a lasting negative effect on the very basis of our lives .
we 're talking about extremely dry summers , yet at the same time torrential rainfall that will repeatedly lead to floods .
we 're talking about rising sea levels , which will also affect germany 's coasts .
so we must not belittle climate change - it will have a massive effect on us . interview : irene quaile -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

analysts say germany and other european countries will be asked to chip in . germany had been willing to lend spurned opel suitor magna as much as 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.7 billion -rrb- to buy and restructure the ruesselsheim-based unit of general motors .
the question is whether now , after very publicly embarrassing chancellor angela merkel and much of the german political establishment , whether general motors will be able to secure a sizable government loan to restructure opel itself .
gm needs the money to close factories , pay severance and further shift its design emphasis towards small fuel-efficient cars , says david bailey , a professor at coventry business school , who adds that though gm 's finances have turned the corner , the company would will likely need state support to restructure .
" i think they will also go to european governments , including the germans , asking for financial assistance .
they 'll be back knocking on doors asking for support , " bailey said .
other likely candidates who will receive a knock on their door include governments in belgium , britain and spain , all of which are home to general motors factories .
the british government , which had feared dramatic jobs losses at the two british factories that produce vauxhall vehicles , praised general motors ' decision and indicated wednesday it may be ready to offer aid .
spanish leaders also indicated their willingness to work with gm and the belgian province of flanders , which is home to an opel factory in antwerp , has long offered up to 500 million euros to any buyer willing to keep the plant open .
frustration and anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel 's government is furious at gm for backing out of the magna deal german politicians have reacted lividly to gm 's decision and demanded that opel repay the 1.5 billion euro bridge loan it extended to the company when gm entered bankruptcy protection .
the new economy minister rainer bruederle said gm 's move was " totally unacceptable . "
but gm 's decision puts the german government in a bind , says bailey .
the government had received a knuckle-rapping from the european commission over strings attached to aid for opel 's eventual buyer - conditions which , according to critics , meant only magna could compete successfully in the bidding process .
" germany 's going to be in a difficult position with the european commission if it now goes back and says we 're not going to fund general motors ' restructuring because , in effect , that says it 's undermining state aid rules , " bailey said .
the german government has invested an enormous amount of time and political capital into rescuing the company , which it saw as a key component of german industry that could not be allowed to disappear .
further , the government was facing an election in september and did not want to be seen abandoning blue-collar workers at a time when banks were being bailed out with government funds .
" the german government was fully committed from day one , " said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
german funding still likely despite the very public anger german politicians expressed about how gm rejected the magna deal , stefan bratzl of the university of bergisch gladbach believes both german federal and state governments will soon change their tune despite the possibility that gm will use their money to close one or more production sites in germany .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british politicians and unions are pleased with gm 's decision and think it will save jobs " when the dust clears , i 'm sure the german government will be willing to offer some credit to gm , " bratzl told deutsche welle , saying two to three billion euros could be made available .
if combined with aid from other countries with opel factories , the total sum available to gm could come close to the 4.5 billion euros germany was prepared to make available to magna .
" the danger i think here for taxpayers is that gm in effect touts its business around europe asking for the biggest subsidy package , " said coventry business school 's bailey , who said that the european commission would need to step in to prevent a subsidy bidding war .
but auto analyst bratzl said eu states may have learned their lesson from the very public rebuke germany received over its initial loan conditions to magna , which would have heavily favored german industry over other eu members .
" governments will probably be a bit more cautious about giving money that sets conditions , " bratzl said .

in a statement read to journalists in berlin , government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said the german government " regrets the decision " and that merkel would convene her cabinet on wednesday to discuss the move .
german economics minister rainer bruederle called gm 's u-turn on opel " totally unacceptable " and said he expected general motors to present a restructuring plan as quickly as possible .
the decision was an abrupt end to months of talks in which the german government had agreed to provide 4.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.6 billion -rrb- in financial aid for the magna deal in september .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch says he is worried about opel 's future state leaders defend their opel factories in the german state of hesse , where opel has its european headquarters , state premier roland koch said he was " shocked and angry " over the decision to scrap the sale of opel .
" in light of the negative experiences of the past years with gm 's business model , i am very worried about the future of this firm and its jobs , " koch said .
koch also said that he expected general motors to pay back the 1.5 billion euro transition loan that is currently keeping opel 's day-to-day operations afloat " so that the german taxpayer does not suffer the loss . "
facing a possibly contentious election next spring , juergen ruettgers , the state premier of north rhine-westphalia , where opel 's bochum plant is located , said that " turbo-capitalism had reared its ugly head " and that gm was " leaving its workers out in the rain . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juergen ruettgers says gm has ' left workers in the rain ' ferdinand dudenhoeffer , a german expert on the auto industry , was also highly critical of the gm announcement , calling it " the umpteenth restructuring plan " and accusing the us carmaker of having no real strategy for its european business .
dudenhoeffer warned that gm now faces disappointed workers , who distrust a weakened management , and lots of red ink .
reiner einenkel , the german works council chief at opel 's factory in bochum , said gm 's decision created " a difficult situation for employees … -lsb- because -rsb- … gm needs money to keep opel running . "
opel works council president klaus franz has called for warning strikes at the carmaker 's facilities across europe beginning thursday .
decision affects workers across europe about half of opel 's 50,000 employees work in germany , with the rest divided among auto assembly plants located in britain , spain , belgium and poland .
engines , transmissions and powertrains are also built at opel subsidiaries in italy , hungary and austria .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : opel employees at an earlier demonstration in germany representatives of spanish opel workers on wednesday expressed surprise at gm 's decision to keep opel , saying they were " exhausted by so much uncertainty . "
employees at opel 's figueruelas plant near zaragoza deplored the sudden change of the situation after weeks of tough negotiations .
spanish opel workers had reached a deal with magna to cut 900 out of 7,500 jobs , instead of the 1,300 originally planned .
in belgium , the news " was not good for antwerp " said kris peeters , the governor of the dutch-speaking flanders region , referring to the plant located there . the british government said it would work with general motors on future proposals for opel . " we have noted gm 's announcement and want to work closely with gm to understand their plan for the business and what it means for the uk , " a spokesman for the department of business said . britain had been unwilling to support the restructuring plan by magna for opel , fearing job losses at opel subsidiary vauxhall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at opel vauxhall in england the unions are happy news not all bad the british trade union unite , however , welcomed gm 's move , calling it " an incredible turnaround . "
" it is the best decision for britain and our plants , " unite general-secretary tony woodley said .
" i am absolutely delighted that general motors has finally done the right thing for them and for us , " he said .
german auto analyst dudenhoeffer said a " plausible scenario " now would be a bankruptcy plan for opel , which would include plant closures in bochum and kaiserslautern in germany , antwerp , belgium and ellesmere port in england .
but , he warned , although a restructuring plan can cut costs , it can not replace a weak product line. gb / dpa / afp / ap / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 04.11.2009 new treatments for neglected diseases come from emerging nations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : drugs for otherwise neglected diseases could be a market for emerging economies drug companies in emerging nations are well positioned to develop ways to fight dozens of otherwise neglected tropical diseases that affect mainly the poor . peter singer is professor of medicine and the head of the mclaughlin-rotman centre for global health . he talked to deutsche welle about ways to combat dozens of neglected tropical diseases . deutsche welle : why do you think it is vital to step up the fight against neglected tropical diseases ? peter singer : neglected tropical diseases are about 30 diseases that nobody can name - things most people have n't heard of .
but they are the true diseases of the poor .
they affect a billion people , they are chronic infections and they keep people in poverty . unfortunately , there are very few innovations , drugs , vaccines and diagnostics for these diseases .
that 's why it 's an important problem and that 's why any source of innovation really needs to be tapped and identified . we have so many drugs for so many diseases like tuberculosis and malaria and there 's so much money being spent on aids .
why is there so little money being spent on these neglected diseases ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : even malaria and other diseases that get the most attention do n't have vaccines even though there is a lot of money being spent on tuberculosis and malaria and hiv , we still do n't have a malaria vaccine , an effective tuberculosis vaccine , or an hiv vaccine on the market , but having said that , those three diseases were pretty neglected until five or 10 years ago . the 30 diseases are really , really neglected because they affect the poor .
we looked at 78 companies in india , china , brazil and south africa to identify the products they have on the market and the products they have in the pipeline and one of our key conclusions is that there is a pipeline of affordable innovations of vaccines , drugs and diagnostics for these neglected diseases in emerging economy companies .
you can also think of it as a new vein of gold just sitting below the surface that has n't been fully mined . do you think these drugs from companies in emerging nations could help more effectively than multinational pharmaceutical companies ? i would n't say more effectively , but i would say they are an alternative and an additional , rich source of drugs and vaccines and diagnostics .
we found 62 products for neglected tropical diseases , 28 of which are on the market , with 44 others in development . one key feature is that they were more affordable because these companies are closer to the problem and when they are innovating they are doing it with the price in mind .
this is a source of affordable innovation .
with the cost structures of multinationals , as important as their programs are , there will always be drug and technology donation programs . for companies in emerging economies , diseases of poverty become market opportunities .
some of these innovations could be developed on a quasi-commercial or commercial basis , which is more sustainable and scalable . if affordability is one of the main criteria , how can you ensure that the products are affordable for the poor ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : keeping drug treatment affordable is a major concern for poor nations even if something is 10 times cheaper , you can buy 10 times as much or buy it in the first place if it was too expensive .
there still is a market failure at the very bottom of the pyramid .
what we 've done is propose the global health accelerator to help get these drugs , vaccines and diagnostics to the poor . we found companies could serve their local and regional markets well but often had innovations that were useful for distant markets but never reached them .
the global health accelerator would provide business services , access to financing for research , and even an annual global health enterprise to recognize the most affordable and effective innovations for the poor .
there is still some help needed to get drugs and diagnostics from emerging economies to the very distant poor markets , but if you have affordable innovation you 're at a much better starting point . multinationals have been donating drugs to poor regions .
do you think these donations could be replaced by the new system ? i would say supplemented .
these are different types of innovations .
the multinationals have historically had different types of innovation . i do n't see any reason to replace it if you have a finished drug on the market that is excellent for river blindness , for example , and it happens to be owned by a multinational and that company has been donating that drug for 30 years and virtually eliminated the problem , and this is an example of an actual case with merk - you would n't want to stop that .
you 'd want to continue it .
but what about the other 29 neglected tropical diseases for which there are n't that many vaccines and drugs and diagnostics ?
that 's where any additional source - like the very robust source of companies in emerging economies - should be welcome . i think we need to put the pieces of the puzzle together to tackle the huge , technical , social , ethical problems like the problem of global health . click on the audio link below to find out how the global health accelerator could help companies , government and non-government organizations improve the fight against neglected tropical diseases and the health of the poor around the world . interview : anke rasper -lrb- sms -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we discussed climate change extensively and all of us agreed that it was imperative for us to redouble our efforts in the weeks between now and the copenhagen meeting to ensure that we create a framework for progress , " obama told reporters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso was more optimistic about copenhagen after speaking to obama the un conference to fight climate change will be held in copenhagen from december 7 to 18 , where emerging economic powerhouses china and india will face western industrial nations in the drive to reduce greenhouse gas emissions .
the meeting in washington was deemed a success by both sides , with eu leaders visibly happier with obama 's attitude to the problem than that of his predecessor .
" president obama changed the climate on the climate negotiations .
with the strong leadership of the united states we can indeed make an agreement , " said european commission president jose manuel barroso , " regarding climate change , i want to say that i am more confident now than i was in days before . "
immune to pressure at the short eu-us summit , which continues wednesday when the eu leaders meet us energy secretary steven chu , the europeans pressed washington to take action on climate change ahead of december 's summit , warning that not enough had been done .
the meeting followed angela merkel 's historic speech before congress , in which she set a fixed target for lawmakers around the world .
" we need an agreement on one objective - global warming must not exceed 2 degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 f -rrb- , " she said , " to achieve this , we need the readiness of all countries to accept internationally binding obligations . "
but a significant political faction in the us remains immune to international pressure .
even as merkel and obama stressed the need to solidify a framework agreement at copenhagen , republican lawmakers boycotted a committee meeting on an obama-backed bill to set the first us requirements on curbing carbon emissions .
asked what impact merkel 's speech might have on the us debate , senator james inhofe , the top republican on the committee looking at the climate legislation , said , " none whatsoever . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : climate change is becoming more and more of a priority for the eu despite the boycott , senate environment and public works committee chairman barbara boxer hailed the committee 's first work session a success .
she told reporters that she sensed a " fundamental shift " in the debate , after receiving a letter from us chamber of commerce saying it was open to a " new conversation " on the issue .
copenhagen will be no kyoto before meeting obama , barroso warned against setting expectations for copenhagen too high .
" of course we are not going to have a full-fledged binding treaty , kyoto-type , by copenhagen , " he told reporters .
" this is obvious .
there is no time for that . "
an international meeting next year in mexico could be used to finalize a treaty , but barroso said copenhagen needed to come up with the framework of the deal , and that the usa in particular should take a lead role. bk / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gm has owned opel since 1929 .
german politicians appeared shocked by general motors ' decision to hold onto opel rather than sell it to auto parts maker magna .
but gm had been signalling that it was unenthusiastic about the deal for months . although the official reaction in berlin on wednesday was one of shock and surprise , the signs were present all along that general motors did not want to sell a controlling stake in opel to magna .
throughout the torturous negotiation process , underway since february , gm executives had said they were concerned about losing access to technology and vehicles under development at the opel design center in ruesselsheim .
in august , gm 's management even indicated that it preferred a rival bid from the belgian private equity fund rhj that would give gm the option of repurchasing opel - but then the german government said it would not finance such a deal .
" i am surprised only in that i thought -lsb- the deal -rsb- was too far gone , " said david bailey , a professor at coventry business school in britain .
" gm has never been happy with the deal . "
bildunterschrift : gm says it will spend three billion euros to restructure opel .
general motors ' future hinges on opel by holding onto opel , general motors is pinning its future to the small car platform under development in ruesselsheim , said csm worldwide analyst mark fulthorpe .
a deal with magna would have separated gm from those designs after the newest models are introduced .
" we all thought this was a stumbling block to the deal , because ruesselsheim was so key to the development of the global epsilon delta platforms , " fulthorpe told deutsche welle .
" so much intellectual property resides there . "
further , magna 's deal was financed by the state-owned russian sberbank and many observers believed that magna would have transferred gm technology to russian carmakers , strengthening potential rivals in a market gm sees as essential to the company 's future , said business professor bailey .
government-backed scrapping bonuses that encouraged consumers to replace older cars with new models have supported sales throughout europe and the united states , along with the emerging economic recovery , have also emboldened general motors .
on tuesday , gm announced that sales in the us had risen for the first time in 21 months .
" clearly gm thinks that their financial position is such that they can afford to restructure gm in europe , " said bailey . in a statement issued tuesday evening , gm estimated restructuring opel would cost three billion euros -lrb- $ 4.5 billion -rrb- - far less than the 4.5 billion euros magna said it would require .
european opposition helped sink the deal germany 's decision to underwrite the sale to magna through government loans also raised problems that were becoming apparent to all involved in the negotiations .
factories in belgium , britain and spain were targeted for closure or job cuts , leading governments in those countries to accuse germany of subsidizing the protection of german jobs at the expense of their own .
the european commission stepped in and agreed that germany could not finance a loan package that favored magna 's plan , which weighted job cuts outside of germany more heavily , over the plans of other buyers .
the commission 's decision gave cover to general motors to hold opel , said bailey , because now the german government will find it hard to avoid offering gm a similar loan package to the one it offered magna .

viewpoint ros levenson lay member of the general medical council ' doctors need to deliver vital information in a way that is sympathetic to our needs ' one of the most vital skills a doctor can learn is how to deliver difficult or bad news in a clear and sympathetic way .
ros levenson , a lay member of the general medical council , explains how their training is changing to make sure that all doctors have a good bedside manner .
doctors are often there at the most crucial times in our lives such as births , deaths and occasions when close family members or friends may be ill .
in the past , it was all a bit more hit-and-miss we trust they know how to help us and put our faith in their skills , knowledge and abilities .
yet can their crucial ' bedside manner ' help doctors to deliver us with vital information in a way that we can understand and is sympathetic to our needs ?
future doctors basic medical knowledge and clinical skills , while fundamentally important , will not be enough on their own .
medical students must be inspired to learn about medicine in all its aspects to work with patients and become the doctors of the future .
students need to be taught to work effectively with others , passing on information and handing over care , as well as giving feedback to colleagues read your comments we 're all familiar with the idea that a doctor 's ' bedside manner ' may be as important to the patient as his or her technical competence , possibly even affecting the recovery process .
but perhaps in the past , it was all a bit more hit-and-miss .
we assumed and hoped that young doctors were either inherently good communicators , or they would automatically learn how to communicate -lrb- and how not to -rrb- from their more experienced colleagues .
while i would n't assume that all medical students and junior doctors have the same innate communication skills or compassionate personalities on which to build , i certainly do believe that we can and should provide them with the tools and training to be effective communicators .
sensitive issues that is why the new edition of tomorrow 's doctors , published by the general medical council -lrb- gmc -rrb- is so important .
tomorrow 's doctors requires medical schools to ensure that their students can communicate effectively - including demonstrating how to break bad news , discuss sensitive issues or plan treatment with vulnerable patients .
some students may find these hard lessons to learn students also need to be taught to work effectively with others , passing on information and handing over care , as well as giving feedback to colleagues .
tomorrow 's doctors will also see students expected to master specific clinical procedures like administering a local anaesthetic before they graduate .
' hard lessons ' these procedures ensure that students are able to take advantage of advances in medical technology that allows increasingly lifelike training mannequins to be used for clinical procedures , as well as developing skills on real patients with consent and under supervision .
it is important that students are able to communicate effectively with patients in these situations and put them at ease .

in rare instances , it may even be necessary to advise students to pursue other courses more suited to their abilities .
we also need to help students to develop their confidence and their communication skills .
student assistantships , in which students act as assistants to a junior doctor , with defined duties under appropriate supervision , can be very helpful .
and , of course , it is hoped that tomorrow 's doctors will continue to improve their bedside manner throughout their careers as they gain experience and listen to what their patients tell them .

advertisement " this box not only brings the world to your living room - it has changed the world . "
after a little over 12 months and more than 50,000 miles the bbc box is back in the uk at television centre in west london .
it has picked up a few dents and is slightly faded but was still striking enough to attract rapt attention from passers by as it was carried along wood lane in heavy traffic .
many of you have been tracking the bbc shipping container on its travels around the world since last september .
its voyage has coincided with some of the most dramatic developments in the global economy including the first global recession in 60 years .
and the battering our container has had along the way has been more than matched by the battering visited on the container shipping industry .
trade at standstill the box at television centre with a record 10 % of the fleet idle , and revenues per container likely to drop from already extremely depressed levels , it has certainly been an interesting time to be following a single container around the world .
the bbc box project was intended to tell the story of the global economy and international trade over the course of a year and we have charted its progress on radio , television and online .
and as global trade reached near standstill at the height of the turmoil , our box followed .
from april until july it sat forlornly -lrb- if containers can be forlorn -rrb- in the japanese port of yokohama .
it was just one tiny illustration of the statistic that the container business made a collective profit of £ 3bn in 2008 , but is estimated to have lost a cool £ 20bn in 2009 .
so what else have we learnt from the journey ?
way back , in what seems like a different economic world , our container delivered its first cargo of scotch whisky from greenock to shanghai , in china .
we showed the growing strength of china 's consumer class whose buying habits seem only to have been momentarily slowed by the global recession .
piracy issues but even that blip badly hurt in brazil as we found out when the box arrived at the busy port of santos earlier this year .
for them the dip in china 's iron imports was painful - a dip made worse by falling demand across the world for goods made in china .
from singapore to new york , los angeles and bangkok we learned vividly just how inter-dependent countries have become , and what globalisation really means close up .
demand for goods made in china fell , so fewer containers were shipped along the way , literally , we were able to cover developments in international piracy , including its impact on insurance and the profitability of the suez canal through which the box passed early in its journey .
perhaps my favourite story was that of copenhagen express captain sanjeev kaushal who only found out about the bbc box , and that he was carrying it on his own ship , from relatives e-mailing him on board .
i should be clear that the project has had some frustrations .
the gps satellite tracking on the container has been intermittent and for periods of the year , we have had to manually track the position of the box , though not nearly as frequently as we would have liked .
soup kitchen the box project has been overseen by a small team in addition to their other full-time roles and thus we have not been able to respond to as many of your e-mails and comments as we would have liked .
and there were plans that we could n't see through for budgeting or logistical challenges , such as placing a bbc correspondent on board a container ship for one leg of its journey .
i should reiterate here that this project has not cost the bbc a great deal of money .
the box is now back in the uk , but will soon be sent to africa at all times , this has been a real , working box and we have only paid for the journalism to cover it .
this week we have invited some of the schoolchildren who have been following the bbc box in their classes all year to come along to see it close up , and share with us what they have learned .
but that is not the final chapter .
our project partners nyk have generously agreed to donate the container for charitable use and they will transport it to africa where it will be refitted as a permanent soup kitchen for some of those people who have been worst affected by the global recession .
and for all the box aficionados , our website will remain active so all the content we have produced can continue to be enjoyed in the future .

advertisement " this box not only brings the world to your living room - it has changed the world . "
after a little over 12 months and more than 50,000 miles the bbc box is back in the uk at television centre in west london .
it has picked up a few dents and is slightly faded but was still striking enough to attract rapt attention from passers by as it was carried along wood lane in heavy traffic .
many of you have been tracking the bbc shipping container on its travels around the world since last september .
its voyage has coincided with some of the most dramatic developments in the global economy including the first global recession in 60 years .
and the battering our container has had along the way has been more than matched by the battering visited on the container shipping industry .
trade at standstill the box at television centre with a record 10 % of the fleet idle , and revenues per container likely to drop from already extremely depressed levels , it has certainly been an interesting time to be following a single container around the world .
the bbc box project was intended to tell the story of the global economy and international trade over the course of a year and we have charted its progress on radio , television and online .
and as global trade reached near standstill at the height of the turmoil , our box followed .
from april until july it sat forlornly -lrb- if containers can be forlorn -rrb- in the japanese port of yokohama .
it was just one tiny illustration of the statistic that the container business made a collective profit of £ 3bn in 2008 , but is estimated to have lost a cool £ 20bn in 2009 .
so what else have we learnt from the journey ?
way back , in what seems like a different economic world , our container delivered its first cargo of scotch whisky from greenock to shanghai , in china .
we showed the growing strength of china 's consumer class whose buying habits seem only to have been momentarily slowed by the global recession .
piracy issues but even that blip badly hurt in brazil as we found out when the box arrived at the busy port of santos earlier this year .
for them the dip in china 's iron imports was painful - a dip made worse by falling demand across the world for goods made in china .
from singapore to new york , los angeles and bangkok we learned vividly just how inter-dependent countries have become , and what globalisation really means close up .
demand for goods made in china fell , so fewer containers were shipped along the way , literally , we were able to cover developments in international piracy , including its impact on insurance and the profitability of the suez canal through which the box passed early in its journey .
perhaps my favourite story was that of copenhagen express captain sanjeev kaushal who only found out about the bbc box , and that he was carrying it on his own ship , from relatives e-mailing him on board .
i should be clear that the project has had some frustrations .
the gps satellite tracking on the container has been intermittent and for periods of the year , we have had to manually track the position of the box , though not nearly as frequently as we would have liked .
soup kitchen the box project has been overseen by a small team in addition to their other full-time roles and thus we have not been able to respond to as many of your e-mails and comments as we would have liked .
and there were plans that we could n't see through for budgeting or logistical challenges , such as placing a bbc correspondent on board a container ship for one leg of its journey .

but tuesday , 3 november 2009 , is a day that many democrats will probably want to forget .
one year after the election of the nation 's first african-american president , voters in virginia and new jersey turned their back on the democratic party .
it is inevitable that these results will reflect badly on the president .
that is certainly what the republicans wanted .
but in reality these elections were not a simple referendum on mr obama .
exit polls in both virginia and new jersey showed that a small majority still approved of the way he is running the country .
it is the economy that seems to have been the overriding concern .
that along with a whole host of more parochial and even personality issues .
' stumbling performances ' it is worth remembering that these were essentially local elections .
virginia was the first state to turn from blue to red .
but at a democratic " victory " party in arlington the activists i spoke to blamed the defeat on their candidate , creigh deeds , not mr obama .
a number told me he had simply failed to get his message across .
his stumbling performances had made his republican rival , bob mcdonnell , appear slick .
virginians also have a habit of changing their mind after each presidential election .
after voting for obama last year , it was the turn of the democrats to get a kick in the teeth .
new jersey followed the same way as virginia , with republican chris christie ousting the sitting democratic governor , jon corzine .
at first this gubernatorial contest might have also looked like a referendum on barack obama .
jon corzine had been hanging on the coat tails of the president 's personal popularity in this strongly democratic state .
mr obama had lent his support on the campaign trail and in tv ads .
but once again the economy and concerns about jobs seem to have been the deciding factors .
jon corzine had raised taxes , chris christie promised to cut them .
exit polls showed that voters who expressed the highest levels of economic discontent heavily favoured the republican candidate .
bitter row so all in all it looked like a good night for republicans .
but there was a sting in the tail .
it happened in the 23rd congressional district in upstate new york , a seat that has been in republican hands for more than a century .
last night it voted democrat thanks largely to a bitter row within republican ranks .
dede scozzafava was the republican candidate .
crazy name , and for a republican some pretty crazy policies - pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage , positions more likely to incense rather than excite the party base .
so some of the party 's biggest names like sarah palin and fred thompson ended up supporting the " conservative party " candidate , doug hoffman .
dede pulled out of the race and backed the democratic candidate - bill owens .
and mr owens ended up winning .
more than that , the democratic party and president obama now have a powerful weapon with which to attack the republican party .
they will say this is the proof that the republican party is being taken over by the right - that it is no longer a place for moderates or independent minded voters .
it was hardly a good night for president obama .
but it could have been much worse .

but tuesday , 3 november 2009 , is a day that many democrats will probably want to forget .
one year after the election of the nation 's first african-american president , voters in virginia and new jersey turned their back on the democratic party .
it is inevitable that these results will reflect badly on the president .
that is certainly what the republicans wanted .
but in reality these elections were not a simple referendum on mr obama .
exit polls in both virginia and new jersey showed that a small majority still approved of the way he is running the country .
it is the economy that seems to have been the overriding concern .
that along with a whole host of more parochial and even personality issues .
' stumbling performances ' it is worth remembering that these were essentially local elections .
virginia was the first state to turn from blue to red .
but at a democratic " victory " party in arlington the activists i spoke to blamed the defeat on their candidate , creigh deeds , not mr obama .
a number told me he had simply failed to get his message across .
his stumbling performances had made his republican rival , bob mcdonnell , appear slick .
virginians also have a habit of changing their mind after each presidential election .
after voting for obama last year , it was the turn of the democrats to get a kick in the teeth .
new jersey followed the same way as virginia , with republican chris christie ousting the sitting democratic governor , jon corzine .
at first this gubernatorial contest might have also looked like a referendum on barack obama .
jon corzine had been hanging on the coat tails of the president 's personal popularity in this strongly democratic state .
mr obama had lent his support on the campaign trail and in tv ads .
but once again the economy and concerns about jobs seem to have been the deciding factors .
jon corzine had raised taxes , chris christie promised to cut them .
exit polls showed that voters who expressed the highest levels of economic discontent heavily favoured the republican candidate .
bitter row so all in all it looked like a good night for republicans .
but there was a sting in the tail .
it happened in the 23rd congressional district in upstate new york , a seat that has been in republican hands for more than a century .
last night it voted democrat thanks largely to a bitter row within republican ranks .
dede scozzafava was the republican candidate .
crazy name , and for a republican some pretty crazy policies - pro-abortion and pro-gay marriage , positions more likely to incense rather than excite the party base .
so some of the party 's biggest names like sarah palin and fred thompson ended up supporting the " conservative party " candidate , doug hoffman .
dede pulled out of the race and backed the democratic candidate - bill owens .
and mr owens ended up winning .
more than that , the democratic party and president obama now have a powerful weapon with which to attack the republican party .
they will say this is the proof that the republican party is being taken over by the right - that it is no longer a place for moderates or independent minded voters .
it was hardly a good night for president obama .
but it could have been much worse .

earlier , the department said it was unable to confirm reports that a child with the virus had died last thursday .
jim wells said he would be asking health minister michael mcgimpsey to reverse the decision .
the minister said the policy of reporting the deaths as soon as possible was no longer sustainable .
the child who died is understood to be a girl from county antrim who had complex medical needs .
she is the fifth special needs child in ni with swine flu to have died .
she is the 11th person from ni to have died after contracting the disease .
' rumour mill ' nine of those deaths occurred in ni , while one person died in england and another in spain .
" northern ireland is a small place and if you do n't provide accurate information to the public fairly quickly , the rumour mill starts to spin and i think that is not helpful in the fight against swine flu , " mr wells said .
" i understand that the department of health are following guidelines from england , where it is done every thursday .
" the difficulty is that northern ireland is a much more close-knit community than that and i think we should adapt our policy to reflect that situation . "
however , mr mcgimpsey said the previous policy of reporting swine flu related deaths as soon as possible was no longer sensible .
" first and foremost , we know that for those families who have just suffered the death of a relative , to then be asked to release personal information for publication is very intrusive and deeply upsetting , " he said .
" secondly , it has become clear that the vast majority of families do not wish to have any details released and only want to grieve in peace . "
last month , two girls from foyleview special school in londonderry who had the virus died within a week of each other .
they were ashleigh lynch and orla o 'kane .
following their deaths , there were calls from some school principals for teachers in special schools to be included in the first wave of vaccinations .
that has now taken place .
more than 2,500 children in over 20 special schools for severe learning disability across northern ireland were offered the vaccine as a matter of urgency .
