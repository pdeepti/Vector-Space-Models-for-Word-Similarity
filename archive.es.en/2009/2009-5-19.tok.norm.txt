when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .

bankers in the us and the uk are hit , textile workers in bangladesh or carmakers in japan .
but the most affected are those already on the bottom rungs of society .
for example , china ’ s rubbish collectors and sorters .
the chinese recycling industry is on the brink of collapse .
the market for recyclable waste paper , metal , glass and plastic has plunged with the export market . the 43-year-old li li has been sitting in front of her bag of bottle tops for hours , removing the plastic from the metal .
her yard in dongxiaokou , on the northern edge of beijing , smells of waste .
roughly 700 people from henan live and work here - surrounded by mountains of plastic bottles , scrap electronic equipment and waste paper .
" people who were born in beijing don ’ t want to do this work , " says li li .
" just some unemployed people who have no other alternatives perhaps .
but we outsiders are used to tough conditions .
the work is filthy and painstaking . "
li li and her three children practically live on the rubbish .
their tiny house is filled to the brim with piles of plastic bottles .
for years , they were able to earn a decent living from collecting and selling recyclable waste .
factories in southern china needed plastic , paper and metal .
but now the world is buying fewer textiles , plastic toys and electronics from china .
the prices have gone down by half or more .
plunging demand just a stone ’ s throw from the lis , people are sorting through huge mountains of plastic bottles , weighing them and shredding them in simple machines .
people are filling bags with plastic chips and piling them up .
before , they would have been sold on immediately and made into synthetic fibres for fleece jackets for example .
but not anymore , says 35-year-old zhang who is surrounded by a sea of bottles and is pulling off their labels : " these synthetic fibres used to be exported but foreigners don ’ t want them any more .
the domestic demand is covered .
the warehouses are full .
this raw material isn ’ t worth anything any more . "
china made a fortune recycling .
the head of nine dragons paper , a southern chinese paper firm , became the richest woman in china by importing waste paper from the us .
but shares have fallen by 90 percent since the beginning of the crisis .
facing debt problems even though in dongxiaokou the figures are much lower , many people also lost out from mis-speculation .
in ying zuozhang ’ s yard , a guard dog is pulling impatiently at his chain .
the 63-year-old ying stands before several mountains of waste paper and cardboard .
he bought it all a year ago when the times were still good .
he was banking on rising prices .
now he ca n't get rid of the card .
ying zhuozhang would rather close shop but he can ’ t because of his debts .
however , li li is seriously thinking of giving up : " i want to sell everything and give up now .
we can rent a flat somewhere , find work and earn a couple hundred yuan a month .
after the financial crisis , we ’ ll find a new place for our business but right now we ’ re just making losses . "
however , like many other rubbish entrepreneurs , li li hasn ’ t yet found anyone to take over her business .
nobody wants anything to do with the once lucrative rubbish mountains of dongxiaokou .

but the most affected are those already on the bottom rungs of society .
for example , china ’ s rubbish collectors and sorters .
the chinese recycling industry is on the brink of collapse .
the market for recyclable waste paper , metal , glass and plastic has plunged with the export market . the 43-year-old li li has been sitting in front of her bag of bottle tops for hours , removing the plastic from the metal .
her yard in dongxiaokou , on the northern edge of beijing , smells of waste .
roughly 700 people from henan live and work here - surrounded by mountains of plastic bottles , scrap electronic equipment and waste paper .
" people who were born in beijing don ’ t want to do this work , " says li li .
" just some unemployed people who have no other alternatives perhaps .
but we outsiders are used to tough conditions .
the work is filthy and painstaking . "
li li and her three children practically live on the rubbish .
their tiny house is filled to the brim with piles of plastic bottles .
for years , they were able to earn a decent living from collecting and selling recyclable waste .
factories in southern china needed plastic , paper and metal .
but now the world is buying fewer textiles , plastic toys and electronics from china .
the prices have gone down by half or more .
plunging demand just a stone ’ s throw from the lis , people are sorting through huge mountains of plastic bottles , weighing them and shredding them in simple machines .
people are filling bags with plastic chips and piling them up .
before , they would have been sold on immediately and made into synthetic fibres for fleece jackets for example .
but not anymore , says 35-year-old zhang who is surrounded by a sea of bottles and is pulling off their labels : " these synthetic fibres used to be exported but foreigners don ’ t want them any more .
the domestic demand is covered .
the warehouses are full .
this raw material isn ’ t worth anything any more . "
china made a fortune recycling .
the head of nine dragons paper , a southern chinese paper firm , became the richest woman in china by importing waste paper from the us .
but shares have fallen by 90 percent since the beginning of the crisis .
facing debt problems even though in dongxiaokou the figures are much lower , many people also lost out from mis-speculation .
in ying zuozhang ’ s yard , a guard dog is pulling impatiently at his chain .
the 63-year-old ying stands before several mountains of waste paper and cardboard .
he bought it all a year ago when the times were still good .
he was banking on rising prices .
now he ca n't get rid of the card .
ying zhuozhang would rather close shop but he can ’ t because of his debts .
however , li li is seriously thinking of giving up : " i want to sell everything and give up now .
we can rent a flat somewhere , find work and earn a couple hundred yuan a month .
after the financial crisis , we ’ ll find a new place for our business but right now we ’ re just making losses . "
however , like many other rubbish entrepreneurs , li li hasn ’ t yet found anyone to take over her business .
nobody wants anything to do with the once lucrative rubbish mountains of dongxiaokou .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .

netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.05.2009 nuclear lobby buoyant as europe warms up to atomic energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's rethink of of nuclear energy has boosted to the industry 's lobby the revival of atomic energy in europe and a new nuclear-friendly mood in both the eu commission and the eu parliament has given the industry 's powerful lobby in brussels a shot in the arm . from sami tulonen 's office in brussels , it 's just a five-minute walk to the eu parliament and three minutes on foot to the european commission .
it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .
" the president gave voice to today 's international consensus in support of the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent and sovereign palestinian state .

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

but merkel ignored them and the hunger strike was called off after five days when it became dangerous to the farmers ' health .
but now , only a few days later , old political allies from bavaria have succeeded in calling a crisis meeting of germany 's state agriculture ministers .
under pressure from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the ministers come together wednesday , ahead of a meeting next week of european union agriculture ministers .
together , the csu and cdu make up the union , the conservative senior partner in germany 's coalition government with the social democrats .
bavaria 's agriculture minister , helmut brunner -lrb- csu -rrb- , promised on tuesday that the ministers would come up with " further support measures " for the farmers and bolster support for federal agriculture minister , ilse aigner , also of the csu , before she heads to brussels for talks .
farmers demand response from government the special attention the csu is paying to the dairy farmers may be a matter of self-preservation .
farmers have long been some of the most devoted union voters .
yet even as milk , and food prices in general , have dropped dramatically in the last year , there has been little reaction from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices have dropped so low that many farmers say they are on the brink of bankruptcy " i have made my disagreement clear , " said brunner , in response to merkel 's refusal to meet with the striking farmers .
both the cdu and csu may face a backlash from voters down on the farm , if the issue is not handled more to their liking .
" there 's an estrangement between the farmers and the union , " said romuald schaber , head of the association of german dairy farmers .
according to a survey conducted by his organization , only 23 percent of dairy farmers would currently vote for the cdu and csu .
the dairy farmers have been divided themselves over the last several years .
the planned lifting of production quotas in 2015 , from which the larger farms in the north and east should profit , has angered the predominantly small , independent farmers of bavaria .
across europe the average wholesale price of milk has dropped by half over the last 18 months .
german dairy farmers are currently getting around 20 cents -lrb- $ 0.27 -rrb- a liter .
at first , it was the bavarian farmers feeling the pinch of dropping prices , but now the " bavarian illness " has spread .
" there 's no difference between east and west or north and south , " said brunner. hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "

" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .

the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .

of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eick was responding to recent comments from metro 's ceo eckhard cordes , who publicly indicated that his company would be willing to support the struggling department store .
old-fashioned department stores have suffered from weak sales in germany as consumers flock to hypermarkets - which combine supermarkets with department stores - and shops run by retail clothing brands .
a merger between the 247 kaufhof and karstadt department stores nationwide , would leave just one department store chain in germany .
although eick dismissed a merger in a newspaper interview tuesday , he did not downplay the seriousness of his company 's financial situation .
eick is the head of arcandor , which runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the quelle mail order business and the thomas cook travel company .
last week , arcandor said it would ask for a 650-million-euro -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- in government-backed loan guarantees to help the company restructure and avoid bankruptcy .
" when we do n't get the state guarantees , arcandor would face insolvency .
that is the unavoidable alternative , " eick told the sueddeutsche zeitung. th / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eick was responding to recent comments from metro 's ceo eckhard cordes , who publicly indicated that his company would be willing to support the struggling department store .
old-fashioned department stores have suffered from weak sales in germany as consumers flock to hypermarkets - which combine supermarkets with department stores - and shops run by retail clothing brands .
a merger between the 247 kaufhof and karstadt department stores nationwide , would leave just one department store chain in germany .
although eick dismissed a merger in a newspaper interview tuesday , he did not downplay the seriousness of his company 's financial situation .
eick is the head of arcandor , which runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the quelle mail order business and the thomas cook travel company .
last week , arcandor said it would ask for a 650-million-euro -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- in government-backed loan guarantees to help the company restructure and avoid bankruptcy .
" when we do n't get the state guarantees , arcandor would face insolvency .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .
it warns these groups are potential recruiting grounds for violent extremists. th / dpa / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.05.2009 us experience brought out the european in me , wenders says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is known for his passion for on-the-road location filming in a candid interview with dw , acclaimed director wim wenders , the last german winner of the palme d 'or at cannes , talks about the influence of us films , his love of road movies and his identity as a european filmmaker . born in 1945 in dusseldorf , wim wenders is considered a major player in the " new german cinema " movement of the 1970s .
he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .

wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .

stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .

gul is highly regarded in europe , where he has acted as one of the driving forces behind turkey 's bid for european union membership . gul 's presidential immunity does not cover allegations which date back to the time before he took office , the court ruled .
turkish authorities must now re-examine the case against gul , who is accused of falsifying documents in the 1990s for the welfare party , a predecessor his ruling ak party .
" it is unthinkable that presidents not be protected by immunity when deputies are , " government spokesman cemil cicek said in response to the court ruling .
the welfare party has been accused of embezzling public money and was outlawed in 1998 .
former prime minister necmettin erbakan was found guilty five years ago for the same fraud case .
gul pardoned him last year .
secularists unhappy with gul the case will now go to an appeals court .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .

powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "

" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .

the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .

but merkel ignored them and the hunger strike was called off after five days when it became dangerous to the farmers ' health .
but now , only a few days later , old political allies from bavaria have succeeded in calling a crisis meeting of germany 's state agriculture ministers .
under pressure from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the ministers come together wednesday , ahead of a meeting next week of european union agriculture ministers .
together , the csu and cdu make up the union , the conservative senior partner in germany 's coalition government with the social democrats .

" there 's an estrangement between the farmers and the union , " said romuald schaber , head of the association of german dairy farmers .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.05.2009 us experience brought out the european in me , wenders says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is known for his passion for on-the-road location filming in a candid interview with dw , acclaimed director wim wenders , the last german winner of the palme d 'or at cannes , talks about the influence of us films , his love of road movies and his identity as a european filmmaker . born in 1945 in dusseldorf , wim wenders is considered a major player in the " new german cinema " movement of the 1970s .
he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .
it warns these groups are potential recruiting grounds for violent extremists. th / dpa / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eick was responding to recent comments from metro 's ceo eckhard cordes , who publicly indicated that his company would be willing to support the struggling department store .
old-fashioned department stores have suffered from weak sales in germany as consumers flock to hypermarkets - which combine supermarkets with department stores - and shops run by retail clothing brands .
a merger between the 247 kaufhof and karstadt department stores nationwide , would leave just one department store chain in germany .
although eick dismissed a merger in a newspaper interview tuesday , he did not downplay the seriousness of his company 's financial situation .
eick is the head of arcandor , which runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the quelle mail order business and the thomas cook travel company .
last week , arcandor said it would ask for a 650-million-euro -lrb- $ 880 million -rrb- in government-backed loan guarantees to help the company restructure and avoid bankruptcy .
" when we do n't get the state guarantees , arcandor would face insolvency .
that is the unavoidable alternative , " eick told the sueddeutsche zeitung. th / dpa / ap / afp editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany 's two largest retailers contemplate merger the giant german retailer , metro group , according to a newspaper report , has proposed a takeover of the karstadt department store chain , which belongs to its troubled retail and tourism competitor , arcandor .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.05.2009 us experience brought out the european in me , wenders says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is known for his passion for on-the-road location filming in a candid interview with dw , acclaimed director wim wenders , the last german winner of the palme d 'or at cannes , talks about the influence of us films , his love of road movies and his identity as a european filmmaker . born in 1945 in dusseldorf , wim wenders is considered a major player in the " new german cinema " movement of the 1970s .
he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .

" today , we have been able to liberate the whole country from ltte terrorism , " rajapaksa told parliament .
" we have been able to defeat one of the most heinous terrorist groups in the world . "
the government has said it killed the tamil tigers leader , vellupillai prabhakaran , as well as his son and heir-apparent , charles anthony , and two top lieutenants .

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .
the only thing the east german system taught us , she said , " was that we should never do it that way again . " hf / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .

the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bankers in the us and the uk are hit , textile workers in bangladesh or carmakers in japan .
but the most affected are those already on the bottom rungs of society .
for example , china ’ s rubbish collectors and sorters .
the chinese recycling industry is on the brink of collapse .
the market for recyclable waste paper , metal , glass and plastic has plunged with the export market . the 43-year-old li li has been sitting in front of her bag of bottle tops for hours , removing the plastic from the metal .
her yard in dongxiaokou , on the northern edge of beijing , smells of waste .
roughly 700 people from henan live and work here - surrounded by mountains of plastic bottles , scrap electronic equipment and waste paper .
" people who were born in beijing don ’ t want to do this work , " says li li .
" just some unemployed people who have no other alternatives perhaps .
but we outsiders are used to tough conditions .
the work is filthy and painstaking . "
li li and her three children practically live on the rubbish .
their tiny house is filled to the brim with piles of plastic bottles .
for years , they were able to earn a decent living from collecting and selling recyclable waste .
factories in southern china needed plastic , paper and metal .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.05.2009 nuclear lobby buoyant as europe warms up to atomic energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's rethink of of nuclear energy has boosted to the industry 's lobby the revival of atomic energy in europe and a new nuclear-friendly mood in both the eu commission and the eu parliament has given the industry 's powerful lobby in brussels a shot in the arm . from sami tulonen 's office in brussels , it 's just a five-minute walk to the eu parliament and three minutes on foot to the european commission .
it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

gul is highly regarded in europe , where he has acted as one of the driving forces behind turkey 's bid for european union membership . gul 's presidential immunity does not cover allegations which date back to the time before he took office , the court ruled .
turkish authorities must now re-examine the case against gul , who is accused of falsifying documents in the 1990s for the welfare party , a predecessor his ruling ak party .
" it is unthinkable that presidents not be protected by immunity when deputies are , " government spokesman cemil cicek said in response to the court ruling .
the welfare party has been accused of embezzling public money and was outlawed in 1998 .
former prime minister necmettin erbakan was found guilty five years ago for the same fraud case .
gul pardoned him last year .
secularists unhappy with gul the case will now go to an appeals court .
in the meantime , gul will continue to serve as president .
" it does n't look like gul 's future is at stake anywhere in the short term but the secularist opposition could try to use this to create noise and discredit the government , " wolfango piccoli from eurasia group think-tank told reuters news agency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands rallied on sunday to support the country 's secular system the court ruling is likely to increase animosity between turkish secularists and the islamist-rooted government .
the secularist establishment includes many army generals , judges and academics .
many secularists accuse the akp of seeking to replace turkey 's secular legal system with a regime based on sharia , or koranic law .
the akp has denied these accusations , saying that while it has religious roots , it is not islamist . the ak party has pointed to political and economic reforms it has undertaken aimed at bringing turkey into the european union. th / afp / reuters editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet everyone was back at the table on tuesday , according to a united nations official . russia had been upset that pro-russian separatists from the breakaway region of abkhazia were not present .
abkhazia had reportedly boycotted the talks , which are being mediated by the eu , the un and the organization for security and cooperation in europe -lrb- osce -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : georgia 's upset by the walkout all of the parties , including abkhazia and south ossetia have agreed to continue the talk , which are aimed at easing tensions between the two countries . russia and georgia briefly fought a war over the rebel regions of abkhazia and ossetia last summer .
abkhazia boycotted the talks to show their displeasure after the united nations described the region as abkhazia , georgia .
georgia upset by walkout the walkout angered georgia , which accused its larger neighbor of trying to " blackmail the international community . "
" this shameful step is yet another violation of the european union-brokered ceasefire agreements and of the latest un resolution , " georgia 's deputy foreign minister giga bokeria told afp .
another georgian diplomat accused the russians of leaving in an " awkward and insulting manner . "
us called walk-out a " coordinated action " the united states said it was " dismayed " at moves by the russians and separatist allies to spurn talks on georgia , calling their actions a coordinated effort to undermine the discussions . " the fact that the walk-out occurred before any substantive discussions began clearly signals a coordinated effort to undermine the geneva talks , " state department spokesman ian kelly said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us state department was dismayed by the action however , the state department later issued a revised statement dropping the sentence accusing the three parties of staging a " coordinated effort to undermine " the discussions .
it gave no explanation .
tensions remain high acrimony between russia and georgia has not died down , despite international efforts .
earlier this month , georgia accused russia of encouraging an army mutiny .
also , a previous meeting with south ossetian officials was called off because the sides could not agree on where to hold it .
russian troops marched into georgia in early august 2008 to fend off a georgian assault on south ossetia .
russian forces briefly occupied large parts of georgia before withdrawing into south ossetia and abkhazia , which moscow recognizes as independent states .
the international community is eager to bring stability to the volatile south caucasus region , which serves as an important transit point for gas and oil. th / afp / reuters / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .
the only thing the east german system taught us , she said , " was that we should never do it that way again . " hf / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .

eu concerned about civilian casualties the european union has demanded an independent inquiry into allegations of human rights abuses during the fighting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of civilians were caught up in the fighting " i very much hope the government of sri lanka will realize that this is the moment to show it governs in the interests of all the people of sri lanka , not just some of them , " british foreign secretary david miliband said .

on tuesday , international aid agencies pushed sri lanka to allow emergency aid to be delievered to an estimated 265,000 people who fled fighting in recent months .
the international committee of the red cross , the only international aid oganization working in the conflict zone , said the military 's final assault had made it impossible to reach civilians in need of help .
" no humanitarian aid has reached those who need it for over a week , " director pierre kraehenbuehl said .
government urged to protect civil rights washington called on sri lanka to " turn the page " and to " create a political arrangement that promotes and protects the rights of all sri lankans . "

rajapaksa also vowed to resettle those displaced by the fighting .
" there are no minority communities in the country , " he added .

his vehicle was hit and the body burned , according to army sources .
ltte spokesman selvarasa pathmanathan said the government had fabricated the news in order to " gloat " following its military victory .

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .
it warns these groups are potential recruiting grounds for violent extremists. th / dpa / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.05.2009 nuclear lobby buoyant as europe warms up to atomic energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's rethink of of nuclear energy has boosted to the industry 's lobby the revival of atomic energy in europe and a new nuclear-friendly mood in both the eu commission and the eu parliament has given the industry 's powerful lobby in brussels a shot in the arm . from sami tulonen 's office in brussels , it 's just a five-minute walk to the eu parliament and three minutes on foot to the european commission .
it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .
the only thing the east german system taught us , she said , " was that we should never do it that way again . " hf / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .

what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

eick was responding to recent comments from metro 's ceo eckhard cordes , who publicly indicated that his company would be willing to support the struggling department store .
old-fashioned department stores have suffered from weak sales in germany as consumers flock to hypermarkets - which combine supermarkets with department stores - and shops run by retail clothing brands .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .

but four months ahead of a general election , the vote on saturday is testing allegiances between old and potential new allies . the race for the german presidency is traditionally devoid of costly campaigning and mud-slinging rhetoric .
in the past the country 's highest political office almost automatically went to the strongest political party 's candidate .
but as september 's general election looms large on the horizon , germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- has decided to put up a fight and has fielded gesine schwan as its candidate .
the spd is seeking to unseat incumbent president horst koehler with the help of the left party .
in an apparent attempt to rally the hard left behind her bid , gesine schwan has blamed germany 's business elite for the current economic crisis , and warned of " an explosive social atmosphere " that could be emerging among the population .
" we can not ignore people 's anger and outrage about the injustices brought about by the crisis , " she told german public broadcaster zdf recently .
" we have to take them seriously when they feel that they have to pay the price for the failures of those who are now shirking their responsibility . "
presidential backlash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : horst koehler hopes to be re-elected for one last term horst koehler has criticized those remarks , accusing his social democratic challenger indirectly of scaremongering .
" what we should n't be doing is creating panic in germany , " he told rbb public radio .
" we should n't give the impression that we can neither cope with the economic nor the social repercussions of the crisis .
of course we can cope , " he added .
koehler is seeking a second term in office and has a narrow majority in the 1,224-seat federal assembly which will elect the next president on saturday .
he 's backed by chancellor angela merkel 's cdu and its bavarian sister party csu as well as the conservatives ' traditional allies the liberal free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
the conservatives hope to form germany 's next government coalition with the fdp .
additional support is expected to come from the conservative free voters ' alliance from bavaria , which has 10 delegates in the federal assembly .
shaky left-wing alliance bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schwan rallies support at a green party convention the social democrats ' contender , gesine schwan , has had to forge a more diverse following , which means wooing the green party and the left party .
the conservatives have accused the spd of flirting with the left party in an attempt to forge a political marriage aimed at taking over the government after september 's general election .
but gesine schwan - a former president of the german-polish viadrina university in frankfurt / oder - is also viewed with skepticism by the hard left .
she is known for her anti-communist stance and has repeatedly called left party chairman oskar lafontaine a demagogue .
as a result the left party has nominated its own candidate - peter sodann - a popular theater and television actor .
however , he stands no chance of being elected president .
third-round cliffhanger nevertheless , challenger gesine schwan is banking on the votes of the left party as well as a third round of voting in which she believes that the hard left will abandon its own candidate .
she also hopes to entice cdu or fdp delegates to her side to win the 613-vote simple majority required in the third round to become german president .
last time around , schwan did win over delegates from the conservative and liberal camps , but she still lost to koehler .
the federal assembly is , indeed , an unpredictable body .
it is made up of 612 members of parliament in addition to a further 612 delegates who come from all walks of life and are chosen by the country 's 16 state governments .
the vote will be held by secret ballot , which makes it a test of political alliances in which a major upset is not entirely unlikely. uw / reuters / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .
" the president gave voice to today 's international consensus in support of the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent and sovereign palestinian state .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .
" the president gave voice to today 's international consensus in support of the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent and sovereign palestinian state .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .

" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de agriculture -pipe- 19.05.2009 farmers ' fury may threaten merkel 's union großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dairy farmers want more protection from the government despite chancellor merkel 's decision to ignore the dairy farmers holding a hunger strike outside her office last week , plummeting prices and struggling farmers may yet weaken her party 's bid for re-election this fall . camping in a field next to the chancellery in berlin with about 150 other dairy farmers , the six hunger strikers had vowed not to eat until angela merkel met with them to organize an emergency national dairy summit .
but merkel ignored them and the hunger strike was called off after five days when it became dangerous to the farmers ' health .
but now , only a few days later , old political allies from bavaria have succeeded in calling a crisis meeting of germany 's state agriculture ministers .
under pressure from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the ministers come together wednesday , ahead of a meeting next week of european union agriculture ministers .
together , the csu and cdu make up the union , the conservative senior partner in germany 's coalition government with the social democrats .
bavaria 's agriculture minister , helmut brunner -lrb- csu -rrb- , promised on tuesday that the ministers would come up with " further support measures " for the farmers and bolster support for federal agriculture minister , ilse aigner , also of the csu , before she heads to brussels for talks .
farmers demand response from government the special attention the csu is paying to the dairy farmers may be a matter of self-preservation .
farmers have long been some of the most devoted union voters .
yet even as milk , and food prices in general , have dropped dramatically in the last year , there has been little reaction from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices have dropped so low that many farmers say they are on the brink of bankruptcy " i have made my disagreement clear , " said brunner , in response to merkel 's refusal to meet with the striking farmers .
both the cdu and csu may face a backlash from voters down on the farm , if the issue is not handled more to their liking .
" there 's an estrangement between the farmers and the union , " said romuald schaber , head of the association of german dairy farmers .
according to a survey conducted by his organization , only 23 percent of dairy farmers would currently vote for the cdu and csu .
the dairy farmers have been divided themselves over the last several years .
the planned lifting of production quotas in 2015 , from which the larger farms in the north and east should profit , has angered the predominantly small , independent farmers of bavaria .
across europe the average wholesale price of milk has dropped by half over the last 18 months .
german dairy farmers are currently getting around 20 cents -lrb- $ 0.27 -rrb- a liter .
at first , it was the bavarian farmers feeling the pinch of dropping prices , but now the " bavarian illness " has spread .
" there 's no difference between east and west or north and south , " said brunner. hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german milk farmers threaten strike as prices plunge the german dairy farmers ' lobby is threatening to strike amid plummeting milk prices and soaring operating costs .
-lrb- 11.05.2009 -rrb- germany urges eu action to halt plunging milk prices last summer , german farmers launched a series of " milk strikes " to protest falling prices .

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .
it warns these groups are potential recruiting grounds for violent extremists. th / dpa / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 19.05.2009 us experience brought out the european in me , wenders says großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders is known for his passion for on-the-road location filming in a candid interview with dw , acclaimed director wim wenders , the last german winner of the palme d 'or at cannes , talks about the influence of us films , his love of road movies and his identity as a european filmmaker . born in 1945 in dusseldorf , wim wenders is considered a major player in the " new german cinema " movement of the 1970s .
he won the top prize at the cannes film festival for his movie ' ' paris , texas " -lrb- 1984 -rrb- and best director three years later for ' ' wings of desire , " -lrb- 1987 -rrb- an homage to berlin .
wenders lived in the united states for more than a decade and made more films there than in europe .
what interested you the most at the beginning of your career ?
pictures , text or music ?
wim wenders : i was purely an image maker .
actually , i originally wanted to be a painter .
i saw my first short films as a continuation of painting by other means .
at the same time , i worked as a film critic and wrote about films .
i never would have dreamed that i would become neither a painter nor a critic , but something in between - a filmmaker .
bildunterschrift : wenders ' 1984 film " paris , texas " won the prestigious palme d 'or at the cannes film festival that happened gradually .
stories happen as soon as you cut two pictures together - that 's already the first step to telling a story .
if you cut some more pictures together , then suddenly you have a character .
then somebody says something and all of a sudden you 're in a narrative without having really noticed .
a beautiful world then opens up when you realize , " aha , i 'm not painting anymore ; rather , i 've suddenly landed in a film . "
it took a few years for me to find my feet .
and then , over the years , i became more of a narrator and less of an image-maker .
you 're known for your passion for on-the-road location filming , which is reflected in your trilogy of road movies .
what does traveling mean for you as a filmmaker ?
i discovered around the time that i made the film " alice in the cities " -lrb- 1974 -rrb- and then in particular with the film " kings of the road " -lrb- 1976 -rrb- that you could practice a profession as filmmaker on the road and that there was a type of film where you could narrate continuously and chronologically - that was the road movie .
that 's where the map was the screenplay or , to put in a better way , the route was the script where you could experience so much as a filmmaker and also later on the big screen .
i saw that as my medium , so to speak - this road movie , this " being-on-the-road " feeling .
i 've always traveled , ever since i was a child .
and now i do it as a profession .
i can almost say that i 'm a traveler first and then a director or photographer .
the fact that you can combine that , that music comes into the picture on the way , that a road movie is practically unthinkable without music , that you need the soundtrack to the trip - that 's where i 'm in my element .
you lived in america for several years and directed most of your films there .
what does that experience mean for you today ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenders in cannes in 2008 yes , i made more films in america than anywhere else .
i lived in the us for a total of 15 or 16 years .
it was a kind of new home for me , a home by choice even though it was there that i really rediscovered myself as a german , or rather discovered myself in the first place .
and i realized during the effort to make american films that i was n't an american director and would never become one .
i also realized that i could never make american films but that i was a german at heart , and a european filmmaker by profession .
i only recognized that abroad , in america , and then accepted it .
how did your european roots shape your perception of cinema ?
i grew up with american films just like any boy in germany , at least in west germany .
just as in former east germany many grew up watching russian films , i grew up with westerners watching american movies .
at the time i did n't really value my european film education - all the films by antonioni , bergman , bunuel and fellini .
that was until i went to america and realized that my world was really more about european cinema and that my real roots did n't lie in american films .

other officials at the meeting confirmed that a financing plan had been established , which will include the federal and state governments and state-controlled banks .
the plan was contingent on a new investor taking over opel and opel 's assets being placed in a trust , according dpa news agency .

but merkel ignored them and the hunger strike was called off after five days when it became dangerous to the farmers ' health .
but now , only a few days later , old political allies from bavaria have succeeded in calling a crisis meeting of germany 's state agriculture ministers .
under pressure from the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- , the bavarian sister party of merkel 's christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- , the ministers come together wednesday , ahead of a meeting next week of european union agriculture ministers .
together , the csu and cdu make up the union , the conservative senior partner in germany 's coalition government with the social democrats .
bavaria 's agriculture minister , helmut brunner -lrb- csu -rrb- , promised on tuesday that the ministers would come up with " further support measures " for the farmers and bolster support for federal agriculture minister , ilse aigner , also of the csu , before she heads to brussels for talks .
farmers demand response from government the special attention the csu is paying to the dairy farmers may be a matter of self-preservation .
farmers have long been some of the most devoted union voters .
yet even as milk , and food prices in general , have dropped dramatically in the last year , there has been little reaction from berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milk prices have dropped so low that many farmers say they are on the brink of bankruptcy " i have made my disagreement clear , " said brunner , in response to merkel 's refusal to meet with the striking farmers .
both the cdu and csu may face a backlash from voters down on the farm , if the issue is not handled more to their liking .
" there 's an estrangement between the farmers and the union , " said romuald schaber , head of the association of german dairy farmers .
according to a survey conducted by his organization , only 23 percent of dairy farmers would currently vote for the cdu and csu .
the dairy farmers have been divided themselves over the last several years .
the planned lifting of production quotas in 2015 , from which the larger farms in the north and east should profit , has angered the predominantly small , independent farmers of bavaria .
across europe the average wholesale price of milk has dropped by half over the last 18 months .
german dairy farmers are currently getting around 20 cents -lrb- $ 0.27 -rrb- a liter .
at first , it was the bavarian farmers feeling the pinch of dropping prices , but now the " bavarian illness " has spread .
" there 's no difference between east and west or north and south , " said brunner. hf / afp / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .

eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .

it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .

but so far obama has failed to win commitment from tel aviv . benjamin netanyahu 's first visit to the oval office did not bring about the easing of tensions that the international community had hoped for .
the israeli prime minister did not endorse a two state solution while in israel itself , a new settlement in the west bank is on the agenda .
on both of those issues us president barack obama had hoped to sway the israeli leader towards compromise .
" it is , i believe , in the interests not only of the palestinians , but also the israelis and the united states and the international community to achieve a two-state solution , in which israelis and palestinians are living side by side in peace and security , " obama said .
the us president also urged netanyahu to freeze jewish settlement building in the west bank , warning that " we have seen progress stalled on this front .
settlements have to be stopped in order for us to move forward . "
the meeting took place only hours after reports emerged in israel that the government appears to plan a new settlement in the west bank .
netanyahu says he 's ready to talk to palestinians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : obama with israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu the two leaders tried to paper over their differences but it was obvious that there was considerably less agreement than washington had hoped for .
netanyahu expressed his readiness to talks with the palestinians but stopped short of mentioning a two-state solution .
instead he only spoke of an " arrangement where palestinians and israelis live side by side in dignity , security and in peace . "
there was yet another issue on the agenda of the talks : iran .
and it was clearly teheran 's nuclear ambitions that were netanyahu 's prime concern for the talks .
" the worst danger we face is that iran would develop nuclear military capabilities , " he said .
israel is in favor of stepping up the pressure right away , to force teheran to abandon its nuclear program .
barack obama however said he will wait until iran 's general elections are over to only then start negotiations with teheran .
but he sought to reassure israel that washington will not " talk forever " .
" by the end of the year we should have some sense whether we are starting to see serious movements on the part of the iranians .
we 're not going to create a situation in which the talks become an excuse for inaction while iran proceeds with developing a nuclear weapon . "
european hopes set to be disappointed the persisting rift in us-israeli relations comes as a disappointment to many in the international community .
european leaders had hoped that the hard-line stance of the new israeli government might be softened somewhat by pressure from washington .
looking ahead at netanyahu 's trip to the us , german chancellor angel merkel earlier this month said that there was " no alternative " to a two-state solution as the only path to peace in the middle east .
she described the coming months as a decisive window of opportunity with a keen eye on how ties between washington and tel aviv would develop .
europe 's own first experience with israel 's new leadership had been somewhat sobering .
earlier this month , foreign minister avigdor lieberman toured the eu to a much disillusioning effect .
the ultranationalist lieberman has rejected the idea of a palestinian state and has announced that israel was no longer bound by the so-called annapolis peace process which formed the basis of israeli-palestinian peace talks in 2008 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israeli foreign minister lieberman found little to agree on with his french counterpart kouchner meeting lieberman in berlin earlier this month , germany 's foreign minister frank walter steinmeier had underlined berlin 's " expectation that the new israeli government maintain its commitment to results produced in previous talks and the goal of a two-state solution . "
steinmeier 's french counterpart bernard kouchner equally insisted that the creation of a palestinian state was central to any chance of peace .
the eu 's external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner warned last month that a planned upgrade of bilateral relations between israel and the eu could not come about until the government in tel aviv commits to the peace talks with the palestinians .
in a reaction to netanyahu 's meeting with obama , the palestinian chief negotiator saeb erekat expressed his disappointement at netanyahu 's stance but welcomed washington 's " unequivocal support " for a palestinian state and the call to freeze settlement activity .
" the president gave voice to today 's international consensus in support of the two-state solution and the establishment of an independent and sovereign palestinian state .

eick was responding to recent comments from metro 's ceo eckhard cordes , who publicly indicated that his company would be willing to support the struggling department store .
old-fashioned department stores have suffered from weak sales in germany as consumers flock to hypermarkets - which combine supermarkets with department stores - and shops run by retail clothing brands .
a merger between the 247 kaufhof and karstadt department stores nationwide , would leave just one department store chain in germany .
although eick dismissed a merger in a newspaper interview tuesday , he did not downplay the seriousness of his company 's financial situation .
eick is the head of arcandor , which runs not only the karstadt department store chain , but also the quelle mail order business and the thomas cook travel company .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 19.05.2009 initiatives for journalistic cooperation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : working together all around the world global media cooperation is our business .
working with radio stations all over the world we produce high quality broadcast features and reports - and promote journalistic skills in our partner countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reporting about pressing topics when deutsche welle started its first international coproduction in april 1979 no one could have predicted it would form the founding stone for 30 years of analysis and reportage .
that first programme with african broadcaster ' voice of kenya ' aired under the title " huduma za sayansi kwa mkulima “ or " science in the service of people " and went out it in kisuaheli , one of the 30 languages dw broadcasts in . since then dw has contributed to over 350 similar coproductions , broadcasting with more than 90 countries from africa , asia , latin america , the caribbean and eastern europe .
in english , spanish , portuguese , german , french , arabic , chinese , russian as well as regional languages . bringing people closer together bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : calling problems by their names one main objective of our coproductions is to develop media cooperation , particularly with radio stations in developing countries and the former eastern bloc .
dw reporters frequently travel to our partner stations all over the world to maintain a high level of personal contact . journalists from deutsche welle and its partner regions have to work together as a team to turn material into radio reportage - sometimes using the most diverse production means and techniques .
each step of the production is undertaken in tandem right through to the final transmission .
all the research , interviewing , voice-clipping and script writing is worked on together up to and including final studio production , taking into consideration of course all the different languages that are in play . the world as your oyster bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowledge breeds understanding coproductions are a challenging medium for the journalists of both dw and its partner stations .
they have to be able to carry out research together and write and produce together .
that means being prepared to get into each other 's mentality and culture , often under new and unfamiliar circumstances . but it is precisely these characteristics that so many co-workers find rewarding .
both sides can really learn and benefit from each other .
because of and in spite of the differences in their global perspectives .
for our german journalists it is often the first time they really get an idea of how difficult life in developing countries can be .
we take a lot of things for granted : like central heating or clean drinking water , things that people in asia , africa and latin america can only dream of . knowledge breeds understanding bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing language barriers and at the end there is always the knowledge that the correspondents have learned from each other and produced a mutual product - reportage or a feature that goes out all over the world , giving listeners an idea of what is going on in developing countries and making them aware of possible solutions .
and at the same time deutsche welle contributes to furthering media development in its partner countries . deutsche welle 's journalistic contributions are subsidised by the federal ministry for economic cooperation and development .
because of this dw journalists are obligated to focus on their partner 's regional journalistic development .
amongst other things this includes professional advice on certain aspects of research and interview techniques and advice on the dramatisation of features scripts for radio . the co-productions are not only carried by local stations but are aired by deutsche welle .
on top of this coverage dw sends the broadcasts to numerous global partners and uses its dw-world web pages to provide the broadest possible coverage .
within germany some of the co-productions are taken up by state broadcasters topics that get under your skin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : close to the people the coproductions cover a broad range of topics and whether it ’ s about the problems of progressive desertification , lacking educational opportunities for women , dirty drinking water in slums , reconciliation processes in countries that have suffered civil war - the dw reporter and their local counterpart have provided a full picture every time . the productions that are also produced and broadcast in the local language achieve extremely high journalistic and technical standards .
proof of this lies in the positive listener feedback both at home and abroad .
because what is important is that we tackle topics that get under people 's skin . commendations and awards the quality of our international service is reflected in the amount of prestigious prizes we have won .
they are also an indicator of how important the topics are that the producers choose .
they are a continuing reflection of the high standards the journalists achieve . 2002 o new york international radio festival 2002 silver medal for , " a rose fell from heaven ... on child labour in ecuador " o new york international radio festival 2002 bronze medal for , " we 're learning to read and ride mopeds .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 19.05.2009 nuclear lobby buoyant as europe warms up to atomic energy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's rethink of of nuclear energy has boosted to the industry 's lobby the revival of atomic energy in europe and a new nuclear-friendly mood in both the eu commission and the eu parliament has given the industry 's powerful lobby in brussels a shot in the arm . from sami tulonen 's office in brussels , it 's just a five-minute walk to the eu parliament and three minutes on foot to the european commission .
it 's the perfect strategic location - a stone 's throw from the corridors of power - for the chief lobbyist of foratom , the umbrella organization of the european nuclear industry .
" when something energy-related is discussed in the commission or parliament , my team is there in a proactive manner to make sure that the nuclear industry is being heard in that debate , " said tulonen .
eu warms up to nuclear energy the nuclear lobby has certainly been banging the drum in recent years and with increasing success .
at the end of 2005 , a slew of eu parliamentarians signed a " statement on climate change and nuclear energy " initiated by foratom .
they included conservative german mps herbert reul and daniel caspary .
" nuclear energy should play an increasingly key role in the worldwide fight against climate change and remain a pillar of eu energy and environment policy , " the paper said .
" we 're firmly convinced that the increased use of nuclear energy - the biggest single component in the fight against climate change - is essential . "
since then , the eu parliament has reaffirmed its nuclear-friendly stance in a number of votes .
most recently in february , mps pushed for nuclear energy to continue to be part of the energy portfolio in europe .
in a report , they urged the eu commission to create a " concrete timetable for investments in nuclear energy . "
the rhetoric dovetails with what is often referred to as a " nuclear renaissance " in europe .
many member states , including france , italy , britain , sweden and a few eastern european countries , are going ahead with plans for the construction of new nuclear plants .
the nuclear industry has stepped up efforts to advertize the potentially positive effects of atomic energy in cutting carbon emissions and limiting global warming as well as reducing europe 's energy dependency .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rebecca harms from germany 's greens says the nuclear industry is exploiting climate change critics have condemned the rethink on nuclear power , pointing out that many eu parliamentarians are letting themselves be fooled by the nuclear lobby 's " climate " arguments .
" if you wanted to be really cynical you could say that the nuclear industry had to invent the whole climate discussion in order to see a chance for themselves , " said rebecca harms , an mp from germany 's green party .
" i know of no other case in which a huge industry tries so hard to benefit from a huge global problem as the nuclear industry does in the case of climate change . "
tide turns in europe despite the criticism , figures show that proponents of nuclear energy are gaining in strength .
a poll by the eu commission said that in 2008 , almost 45 percent of europeans said they were in favor of nuclear energy - a rise of seven percent compared to three years ago .
the european commission too has embraced atomic energy , making it an official part of the bloc 's climate-change policy and describing it as a key component of its energy portfolio for the future .
it 's a far cry from the nuclear-wary mood that prevailed in europe in the wake of the chernobyl incident in 1986 , the world 's worst nuclear disaster .
at the time , safety fears and concerns over radioactive waste prompted many eu nations to announce plans to phase out nuclear power .
the new pro-nuclear mood in brussels is also reflected in the bulging contact lists of the atomic lobby , tulonen said .
" we have a huge number of contacts , compared to five years ago , who frequently discuss - and naturally that 's the biggest value of our work . without contacts , you ca n't do any lobbying , " tulonen said .
" from our perspective , the biggest success , where we 've played some part , is the realization that nuclear is part of the solution .
i think is isreflected in many decisions and reports issued by the commission and the parliament . "
critics deplore lack of transparency but for some , the nuclear lobby 's methods of networking with policy makers remain foggy .
that was illustrated in the case of former euro mp rolf linkohr who worked as a special consultant for eu energy commissioner andris piebalgs after the end of his parliamentary term .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl nuclear disaster swung public opinion in europe in the 1980s against atomic energy in 2007 , linkohr was fired after it emerged he had been on the board of nuclear energy giant enbw and had been consulting energy companies with a private firm during his work for the commission .
for non-governmental organizations such as the corporate europe observatory ceo , linkohr 's case was proof of the murky links between politics and the influential nuclear lobby .
ceo says the nuclear lobby is marked by a persisting lack of transparency .
the eu commission is advised by various expert groups and some of them are from the nuclear sector , yorgos vassalos of ceo said .
" most of the time we have no access to the minutes of the meetings or the membership , because of these safety concerns .
in general it 's very hard to find out about the links of the between the decision-makers and the nuclear lobby , " vassalos said .
powerful and flush with cash what is known for a fact is that the nuclear lobby in brussels is - much like the nuclear industry - one of the most influential and well-funded groups .
according to foratom 's web site , the group spent 1.6 million euros -lrb- $ 2.2 million -rrb- on lobbying the various arms of the eu in 2007 .
tulonen is convinced that nuclear energy has a bright future in europe and that his lobbying work will bear fruit regardless of who wins the european elections next month .
" the european parliament and the european commission have become quite pro-nuclear in the past three to four years , " tulonen said .
" and we 're expecting this to continue , because this is not about dogmatism , it 's about pragmatism . "

that 's according to an annual government report on political extremism . crimes by right-wing extremists jumped 16 percent to 20,422 last year , according to the yearly report published by germany 's interior ministry .
it also concluded there were nearly 900 reports of injuries caused by right-wing violence in 2008 , while the number of neo-nazis rose to about 4,800 .
" the number of neo-nazis , and this is alarming , has risen again , " interior minister wolfgang schaeuble announced during a press conference held to coincide with the report 's release .
violent incidents were the highest in eastern germany , when population differences were taken into account .
a separate survey carried out by the friedrich ebert institute last year found that one in three people in former east germany are openly prejudiced against foreigners .
far-right party losing members bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is losing members the rise in neo-nazis stood in contrast to a decrease in interest in the npd , which has 7,000 members .
part of that drop could be explained by internal squabbles and financial problems that have plagued the party recently .
yet some experts worry that while the npd may be facing a financial crisis internally , the global financial crisis may be boosting support for the far right .
there are fears that voters heading to the polls soon for various state elections will turn to the npd if unemployment soars as a result of economic turmoil .
politicians failed in a bid to have the country 's constitutional court ban the party in 2003 . terrorism remains a concern besides far-right extremism , the report found terrorism poses the other main threat to german security . germany has become a target for islamist terrorists due to its military involvement in afghanistan .
terrorists are a " real danger for security in germany , " the conservative minister said .
according to the report , there are 29 active " islamist groups " in germany with 34,700 members .
it warns these groups are potential recruiting grounds for violent extremists. th / dpa / ap editor : nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

when the berlin wall fell , she toasted the event with a can of beer . chancellor merkel revealed a little bit more about her youth in then-communist east germany on a television talk show on tuesday , amid implications from the leader of the left party that she was somehow complicit in the abuses of the regime .
based on her involvement in the free german youth , the official socialist youth group of the communist german democratic republic , or gdr , left party leader oskar lafontaine said last week that merkel had " belonged to the party 's reserve of fighters . "
" this black and white discussion does n't move us forward , " she countered , saying that joining the group was a matter of course for most young people .
merkel ultimately chose to pursue a career in physics , because , as she put it , " there , the truth is n't so easily bent . "
but , in the late 1970s , when she showed up for a job interview for position as a physicist at the university of ilmenau , she was escorted to a room where she was surprised to find an officer from the stasi secret police , she said .
" i quickly said that it was n't for me because i could n't keep my mouth shut , " merkel commented .
the stasi apparently was n't interested , and she did n't get the job at the university either .
although she did consider fleeing to west germany and had the opportunity to do so in 1986 when she visited a cousin in hamburg , merkel 's relationship to her parents , friends and relatives was too important to take that step , she said .
when she first heard that the border between east and west was open , she called her mother and told her " it could be about to happen . "
later that evening she crossed into west berlin and then ended up " in a totally unknown apartment where there was a case of beer , " she said .
while merkel defended the individual citizens of the gdr , she said there was nothing about the system itself worth duplicating today .
the only thing the east german system taught us , she said , " was that we should never do it that way again . " hf / ap / dpa editor : nancy isenson send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in between her many activities , she found time to send in her “ portrait ” : “ i am a female of 9 years and a pupil studying in the 5th standard .

let ’ s see how many hobbies i can manage to maintain in my future life .

thanking you . ” deepa chakrabarty of new delhi , india entered our june inbox question – which was “ what music makes you think of germany or the german people ? ” read her response and you will understand why she will be receiving a grundig yacht boy 80 radio ! “ my first encounter with german music began when i was a small girl , hardly eight years old . my father presented me with a cassette containing a collection of european classical music .
für elise was the musical piece that greatly attracted my attention . my interest in german music grew and i began to take piano lessons and to learn more about german music , in particular about ludwig van beethoven , the renowned composer of all time . it can be said that fur elise shaped my life . i began to grow up with its lyrical melodies and beautiful tune . this forcefully marked music haunted me as no music has ever done . it has left an everlasting imprint on my life . für elise 's rhythm has been a part of me both in my gloomy and happier days . through for elise i have come to understand the german nation and its friendly , persevering people . this masterpiece , though short , is enough to highlight the extraordinary talent of its composer , beethoven . the intellectual depth , innovative power , intense personal expression and high quality of perfection - traits for which germany is so famous - are all visibly present in für elise , the popular name of the bagatelle in a minor . though i am no authority in music , yet it is my opinion that the solo piano musical number für elise is the greatest gift of germany to the world . now i am a 35 year-old lady but für elise is as fresh and new to me as it was when i first heard it in my childhood . für elise together with beethoven will remain immortal till the last day of my life . ” wasiliy wolkow in krasnoyarsk , russia gave us some insight into his life as well as bringing a smile to our faces with his choice of music ! “ hello dear friends , my name is wasiliy wolkow .
i 'm a young scientist from russia , siberia -lrb- i 'm 28 now -rrb- i really love the german language and germany on the whole .
i look forward to studying the german culture since i work in krasnoyarsk museum of contemporary art .
and also i 'm a teacher in university .
my girlfriend natasha also listens to your radio after my strong advice to learn english through your news and major information programmes .
we adore germany as a centre of culture and art . i 've been in berlin twice and i have really good german friends there .
they also work in a sphere of culture and contemporary art .
so i am looking forward to hear on your waves more about culture , art , science , youth , urban diversity , educational programs and so on .
my favourite programs are arts on the air , inspired minds , concert hour , cool and living planet .
it 's also interesting to hear the german view on the world news .
a song which reminds me most of germany is a song from my german courses in the goethe institute about a little bug something like this : " auf der mauer , auf der lauer sitsne kleiner wanze ... "
sorry about my german : -rrb- i 'm on the way to improving it .
i listened to sido after one of your programs .
and a lot of more german groups .
kraftwerk of course .
best wishes always with you wasiliy wolkow from siberia with love ” we have also given listeners the chance of sharing their program preferences with us and this is what s. s. gunawardhana , secretary of the dw lists club in telijjawila , sri lanka has to say on behalf of his fellow listeners : “ in an institution of your level , it is not a possibility to format programmes to satisfy all the individual tastes .
we could not come to an agreement but as a whole , even out of the present programmes , there is not a single programme which was voted out by the entire membership , even though there were a couple of programmes which were not equally liked by everyone .
it is mentioned here that inbox does not come under any of these categories .
the name of the programme has varied from time to time depending on the tastes , notions , whims and the aspirations of the policy-making heads of the relevant departments at a particular time .
whatever the name of the programme is , the contents of a programme in the form of listeners ’ feedback and opinions was always selected as the most popular and the most used one in the entire set of programmes .
further , whatever is said and done , the general format of the present “ inbox ” is the same old format used in the “ yours sincerely ” of the early seventies .
it does not vary .
in other words , there is hardly anything for one to change in the format .
as such , we request you to keep the “ inbox ” as it is even under a new name , which might change according to future requirements of the time . ” debrabrata bosu of hooghly , west bengal , india sent in the correct answer to our april inbox question as well as giving us some additional information : “ there is a lot of confusion regarding what easter sunday is all about .
for some , easter sunday is about the easter bunny , colourfully decorated easter eggs , and easter egg hunts .
most people understand that easter sunday has something to do with the resurrection of jesus , but are confused as to how the resurrection is related to the easter eggs and the easter bunny .
biblically speaking , there is absolutely no connection between the resurrection of jesus christ and the common modern traditions related to easter sunday .
essentially , what occurred is that in order to make christianity more attractive to non-christians , the ancient roman catholic church mixed the celebration of jesus ' resurrection with a celebration that involved spring fertility rituals .
these spring fertility rituals are the source of the egg and bunny traditions . should we celebrate easter or allow our children to go on easter egg hunts ?
this is a question both parents and church leaders struggle with .
there is nothing essentially evil about painting and hiding eggs and having children search for them .
what is important is our focus .
if our focus is on christ and not the eggs , our children will understand that the eggs are just a game .
children can participate in an easter egg hunt as long as the true meaning of the day is explained and emphasized , but ultimately this must be left up to the discretion of parents . ” miss timi okoko is a member of the radio zeater club in port harcourt , river state of nigeria and has this to say : “ writing to your programme for me is like an experiment .
biochemistry is the search into the chemical composition of life itself .
it gives me great joy to say that i am on the progress to apply for my doctorate in that same line of studies .
you can imagine how fortunate i will be when i am awarded a scholarship .
i am a young african woman in my early 30 's .
as a little girl i had made up my mind to break down the barriers against the female child in the african society .
i duly dedicate ample time to voluntary causes such as the red cross .
i am also an active member of the radio zeater club .
wariebi blip porbeni - principal co-ordinator of the club - is my brother in-law .
for this letter i give credit to him for insisting so much .
he keeps saying that “ if you don ’ t talk about yourself nobody else talks about you " . as always , here at inbox we love to hear from our listeners and – where possible – your response will be featured in inbox or on the inbox page .
many thanks for your continued interest .

the 200m long reinforced concrete structure will provide berths for six new astute-class submarines at the royal navy 's faslane base .
the valiant jetty will be kept in place by four piles at its corners , each as tall as nelson 's column , allowing it to rise and fall with the tide .
five tugs towed the structure on its nine-mile journey from greenock .
the £ 150m jetty , built by amec and morgan est at the inchgreen dry dock , weighs 44,000 tonnes , making it twice as heavy as a typical aircraft carrier .
its hull is composed of 12 watertight cells , running its whole length , with concrete walls half a metre thick .
at each end , a heavy steel " forepeak " provides a mooring for the submarines .
the floating design was necessary because there is a 3m tidal range on the gare loch .

a report by the welsh assembly 's cross-party autism group -lrb- cpag -rrb- revealed 75 % of schools surveyed felt there was a lack of adequate local help available .
some 58 % described further education provision in wales as inadequate .
the national autistic society cymru said the absence of support for autistic young people and their families was " sometimes devastating " .
the study , a snapshot of autism education provision in wales , is based on information gathered from 33 education providers .
these include special schools , mainstream schools with autism resources and further education -lrb- fe -rrb- colleges .
it follows concerns raised in a number of cpag meetings that young people with autism in post-16 and further education were missing out due to a lack of organisation , awareness and understanding .
the issues highlighted in this report are daily realities for young people with autism and their families in wales .
shirley parsley , national autistic society cymru the report examines topics such as the role of the welsh assembly government 's strategic action plan on autistic spectrum disorders , released last year .
it also looks at cooperation between local agencies , schools and colleges and disparities between state and independent provision .
the report also looks specifically at issues affecting young people with asperger 's syndrome , a condition on the ' higher end ' of the autism spectrum .
as one parent told the cpag : " my son will be leaving education soon .
we are having to look for a college in england .
" there is nothing suitable in south wales for him to go to -lrb- post-16 -rrb- so we are having to look in england for places that are n't too far away . "
report findings 75 % of schools feel that there is a lack of adequate local provision of services for the young people they support .
57 % of state schools feel out-competed by the independent sector .
58 % said there is inadequate fe provision for young people on the autism spectrum in wales .
75 % of schools think there are specific issues for young people with asperger 's syndrome in accessing ongoing support in college .
source : a snapshot of autism education provision in wales commenting on the report , janet ryder , assembly member and cpag chair , said the report offered " a useful insight into the problems faced by young people with autism in wales , as well as problems faced by the education providers themselves " .
" some cases of good practice have also been highlighted , which we hope will serve as examples elsewhere in wales , " she added .
" in many cases , if these institutions have an improved understanding an awareness of autism , coupled with suitable guidance , the problems young people face can be addressed . "
' profound effect ' shirley parsley , national coordinator of the national autistic society cymru , said the issues highlighted in the report were daily realities for young people with autism and their families in wales .
she said : " we are told of parents who have had under a week between hearing a decision on a placement , and their child beginning college .
" autism is much more common than most people think .
it affects over 25,000 people in wales .
of these , 6,000 are children and young people aged under 18 .
" missing out on the right support at the right time can have a profound - sometimes devastating - effect on these youngsters and their families . "
cpag was established in 2002 to bring individuals , families , professionals and ams together to discuss autism issues .
the report is being launched at an event hosted by the cpag at the senedd building , cardiff bay .

a report by the welsh assembly 's cross-party autism group -lrb- cpag -rrb- revealed 75 % of schools surveyed felt there was a lack of adequate local help available .
some 58 % described further education provision in wales as inadequate .
the national autistic society cymru said the absence of support for autistic young people and their families was " sometimes devastating " .
the study , a snapshot of autism education provision in wales , is based on information gathered from 33 education providers .
these include special schools , mainstream schools with autism resources and further education -lrb- fe -rrb- colleges .
it follows concerns raised in a number of cpag meetings that young people with autism in post-16 and further education were missing out due to a lack of organisation , awareness and understanding .
the issues highlighted in this report are daily realities for young people with autism and their families in wales .
shirley parsley , national autistic society cymru the report examines topics such as the role of the welsh assembly government 's strategic action plan on autistic spectrum disorders , released last year .
it also looks at cooperation between local agencies , schools and colleges and disparities between state and independent provision .
the report also looks specifically at issues affecting young people with asperger 's syndrome , a condition on the ' higher end ' of the autism spectrum .
as one parent told the cpag : " my son will be leaving education soon .
we are having to look for a college in england .
" there is nothing suitable in south wales for him to go to -lrb- post-16 -rrb- so we are having to look in england for places that are n't too far away . "
report findings 75 % of schools feel that there is a lack of adequate local provision of services for the young people they support .
57 % of state schools feel out-competed by the independent sector .
58 % said there is inadequate fe provision for young people on the autism spectrum in wales .
75 % of schools think there are specific issues for young people with asperger 's syndrome in accessing ongoing support in college .
source : a snapshot of autism education provision in wales commenting on the report , janet ryder , assembly member and cpag chair , said the report offered " a useful insight into the problems faced by young people with autism in wales , as well as problems faced by the education providers themselves " .
" some cases of good practice have also been highlighted , which we hope will serve as examples elsewhere in wales , " she added .
" in many cases , if these institutions have an improved understanding an awareness of autism , coupled with suitable guidance , the problems young people face can be addressed . "
' profound effect ' shirley parsley , national coordinator of the national autistic society cymru , said the issues highlighted in the report were daily realities for young people with autism and their families in wales .
she said : " we are told of parents who have had under a week between hearing a decision on a placement , and their child beginning college .
" autism is much more common than most people think .
it affects over 25,000 people in wales .
of these , 6,000 are children and young people aged under 18 .
" missing out on the right support at the right time can have a profound - sometimes devastating - effect on these youngsters and their families . "

the cost of a lot of electrical items and clothing seems to be coming down , and a lot of the major retailers seem to be having massive sales .
depending on what you can afford / need to buy , there are some bargains to be had .
one new habit i have acquired recently is challenging retailers when they try to charge a different price to what is advertised .
previously if the difference was small i 'd let it pass but now it just makes me even more aware of how prices are creeping up .

february february has been a somewhat stressful month for us , and not just financially .
the car accident which i mentioned in my last entry has taken up an awful lot of my time although thankfully the other driver has now admitted liability and things are at last progressing .
however , as liability was disputed , no accident management company would touch us , which meant that we had to replace the car which was a write-off , out of our savings , without a courtesy car being provided .
my car is also up for its mot and has needed some major work .
sorting out the garden , which we 'd been planning and saving towards for months , is working out to be more complicated and costly to put right .
the last few weeks have been a tad nightmarish .
however there does appear to be light at the end of the tunnel , at least in relation to the accident .
by my rough calculations the cost of daily essentials seem to have gone up by about 30 % in the last 4 years .

petrol and diesel have both crept up considerably over the last few weeks .
its hard to find diesel at under a pound a litre now and there is no sign of the gas and electricity prices coming down anything like the amount by which they have gone up over the last year .
we had really wanted to take a holiday abroad this year , something we have never actually done together , but with the current weakness of sterling i suspect we will head to gb rather than the eurozone .
still , we realise we are lucky in that we at least have secure jobs .
if anything positive can come out of this recession it might be that we begin to realise the value of what we have .
january inflation calculator this month 's personal inflation : 1.9 % use the calculator this month has seen the usual january blues amplified , although christmas was nowhere near as hard on our finances as might have been the case .
there have been so many bills due this month in terms of car tax , insurance and breakdown cover that our careful spending over christmas has been blown out of the water .
to top all that , simon was involved in a car accident -lrb- not his fault -rrb- and it looks as though the car involved will have to be written off , which is particularly annoying , as it was the one that was sitting ready for the mot .
it has n't all been doom and gloom this month , however .
i started a new job at the beginning of the month which is an exciting new challenge and will make our budget somewhat less restrictive .

simple things like dishwasher tablets , which had gone through the roof over the summer , are now on special offer and well worth stocking up on .

thankfully , gas and electric bills are beginning to fall .
however , they are still significantly more expensive than they were a year ago and more falls will be needed , particularly if this cold snap continues .

obviously some things have come down in price over that period but the things i relied upon as a student such as bread , sugar , eggs etc have gone up significantly .
petrol and diesel have both crept up considerably over the last few weeks .
its hard to find diesel at under a pound a litre now and there is no sign of the gas and electricity prices coming down anything like the amount by which they have gone up over the last year .
we had really wanted to take a holiday abroad this year , something we have never actually done together , but with the current weakness of sterling i suspect we will head to gb rather than the eurozone .
still , we realise we are lucky in that we at least have secure jobs .
if anything positive can come out of this recession it might be that we begin to realise the value of what we have .
january inflation calculator this month 's personal inflation : 1.9 % use the calculator this month has seen the usual january blues amplified , although christmas was nowhere near as hard on our finances as might have been the case .
there have been so many bills due this month in terms of car tax , insurance and breakdown cover that our careful spending over christmas has been blown out of the water .
to top all that , simon was involved in a car accident -lrb- not his fault -rrb- and it looks as though the car involved will have to be written off , which is particularly annoying , as it was the one that was sitting ready for the mot .
it has n't all been doom and gloom this month , however .
i started a new job at the beginning of the month which is an exciting new challenge and will make our budget somewhat less restrictive .
in terms of weekly shopping and inflation , we noticed as we were doing our grocery shopping this month that there are bargains to be had on items which were shooting up in price only a few months ago .
i started a new job at the beginning of the month which is an exciting new challenge and will make our budget somewhat less restrictive .
simple things like dishwasher tablets , which had gone through the roof over the summer , are now on special offer and well worth stocking up on .
petrol and diesel prices are wavering at the pumps , though in terms of diesel remaining just under the £ 1 mark , it remains to be seen whether this is a temporary blip due to the situation in gaza or a levelling off in prices after the sharp falls of the autumn .
thankfully , gas and electric bills are beginning to fall .
however , they are still significantly more expensive than they were a year ago and more falls will be needed , particularly if this cold snap continues .
