hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .

wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.11.2009 the " gentle revolution " and the birth of an independent slovakia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak dissident leader alexander dubcek in prague on november 24 , 1989 in slovakia the events of 1989 are remembered as the " gentle revolution " marked by non-violent demonstrations .
but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .

and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .

and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .
" in this case we will observe very closely that the given assurances are kept , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .
the defense lawyer for one of the accused , ramzi binalshibh , said that a conviction of his client would " scarcely be possible without evidence from germany .

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .
" in this case we will observe very closely that the given assurances are kept , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .
the defense lawyer for one of the accused , ramzi binalshibh , said that a conviction of his client would " scarcely be possible without evidence from germany .

the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .

however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .

putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg recently defended the actions of colonel klein .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .

the qatar project , it added , would include a high-speed freight and passenger link to neighboring bahrain .
it also speculated that deutsche bahn 's logistics subsidiary , db schenker , could later expand rail links into saudi arabia .
state-held deutsche bahn did not immediately comment .
joint venture the potential deal follows years of negotiations begun under former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
handelsblatt , quoting government sources in berlin , said a joint venture called the qatar railways development company would be created , with qatar holding 51 percent and deutsche bahn 49 percent .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .

but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg recently defended the actions of colonel klein .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .
" i told him that the german commitment regarding afghanistan is firm , " zu guttenberg told journalists after talks in washington .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .
the guests scored a couple of goals fairly early in the second half , and although frankfurt clawed one back , they could n't find the equalizer .
eleventh-placed frankfurt still sit one spot above gladbach in the league . the evening fixture between borussia dortmund and mainz was a non-starter , with the fans in dortmund 's westfalen stadium treated to a goalless bore draw . finally , in stuttgart , bottom-of-the-table hertha berlin managed to salvage a point against fellow under-achievers stuttgart .
colombian newcomer adrian ramos put berlin ahead just after the restart , but berlin could n't hang on for the win , conceding a 73rd minute equalizer .
one point , however , was not enough to lift berlin off the bottom of the table , nor was it enough to get stuttgart out of the relegation zone . on sunday bayer leverkusen travel to bayern munich , and could go top if they get a result there .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .

he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .

what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .
" in this case we will observe very closely that the given assurances are kept , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .
the defense lawyer for one of the accused , ramzi binalshibh , said that a conviction of his client would " scarcely be possible without evidence from germany .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .

it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .

colombian newcomer adrian ramos put berlin ahead just after the restart , but berlin could n't hang on for the win , conceding a 73rd minute equalizer .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black .

i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .

parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .

the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .

he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg has defended the actions of september 4 federal prosecutors in germany are still trying to ascertain if the airstrike is defendable under the law of war or if colonel klein is vulnerable to civilian prosecution .
new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg recently defended the actions of colonel klein .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .
" i told him that the german commitment regarding afghanistan is firm , " zu guttenberg told journalists after talks in washington .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .

penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 21.11.2009 the german language should be promoted , says politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someworry about the future of the german language wolfgang boernsen is a member of the german parliament and in favor of declaring german as germany 's official language in the country 's constitution .
he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .
a bricklayer by trade , he comes from flensburg in northern germany and studied in the city of kiel .
he spent one semester as an exchange student in the usa and assisted with development aid in india .
he is a high school teacher and an assistant lecturer who enjoys cultivating his northern german dialect and has written a book about it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 21.11.2009 the german language should be promoted , says politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someworry about the future of the german language wolfgang boernsen is a member of the german parliament and in favor of declaring german as germany 's official language in the country 's constitution .
he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 21.11.2009 the german language should be promoted , says politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someworry about the future of the german language wolfgang boernsen is a member of the german parliament and in favor of declaring german as germany 's official language in the country 's constitution .
he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .
a bricklayer by trade , he comes from flensburg in northern germany and studied in the city of kiel .
he spent one semester as an exchange student in the usa and assisted with development aid in india .
he is a high school teacher and an assistant lecturer who enjoys cultivating his northern german dialect and has written a book about it .
he is the vice-chairman of the deutsche welle broadcasting commission . interview : berthold stevens -lrb- ew -rrb- editor : kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german rail operator deutsche bahn says it is close to completing a contract worth 17 billion euros with qatar to help build a passenger and freight rail network in the wealthy gulf emirate . german transport minister peter ramsauer said he and deutsche bahn chief executive ruediger grube will sign the deal in qatar on sunday .
the online version of the business newspaper handelsblatt says the contract package is worth 17 billion euros , comprising planning , building of rail infrastructure and providing rail vehicles , with german firms likely to win stakes in the project .
the qatar project , it added , would include a high-speed freight and passenger link to neighboring bahrain .
it also speculated that deutsche bahn 's logistics subsidiary , db schenker , could later expand rail links into saudi arabia .
state-held deutsche bahn did not immediately comment .
joint venture the potential deal follows years of negotiations begun under former german chancellor gerhard schroeder .
handelsblatt , quoting government sources in berlin , said a joint venture called the qatar railways development company would be created , with qatar holding 51 percent and deutsche bahn 49 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : overview of gulf region the project would include a commuter rail system for the one million residents of qatar 's main city of doha and a high-speed link with its international airport .
planning would cost 700 million euros , with deutsche bahn aiming for a share of that and later a share of qatar 's rail operations .
handelsblatt also says the building of qatar 's rail infrastructure will cost 14 billion euros , with german building firms in the bidding .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .
" i told him that the german commitment regarding afghanistan is firm , " zu guttenberg told journalists after talks in washington .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .

however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .
the guests scored a couple of goals fairly early in the second half , and although frankfurt clawed one back , they could n't find the equalizer .
eleventh-placed frankfurt still sit one spot above gladbach in the league . the evening fixture between borussia dortmund and mainz was a non-starter , with the fans in dortmund 's westfalen stadium treated to a goalless bore draw . finally , in stuttgart , bottom-of-the-table hertha berlin managed to salvage a point against fellow under-achievers stuttgart .
colombian newcomer adrian ramos put berlin ahead just after the restart , but berlin could n't hang on for the win , conceding a 73rd minute equalizer .
one point , however , was not enough to lift berlin off the bottom of the table , nor was it enough to get stuttgart out of the relegation zone . on sunday bayer leverkusen travel to bayern munich , and could go top if they get a result there .

germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .
" in this case we will observe very closely that the given assurances are kept , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .
the defense lawyer for one of the accused , ramzi binalshibh , said that a conviction of his client would " scarcely be possible without evidence from germany .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this will never happen , says the country 's conservative prime minister . supporters of albania 's opposition party have set up camp to demand a recount in the country 's general election .
socialist party members and supporters spent the night in tents outside the office of conservative prime minister sali berisha , after marching through the capital tirana .
they demanded that a number of ballot boxes that were declared invalid in the june election should be opened .
demonstrators want a probe into allegations of vote rigging and a recount of the poll .
the protests follow an agreement by eu foreign ministers that albania should be considered for membership of the union .
the balkan country has been told by european ambassadors that it must be more serious about fighting corruption .
protesters demand a recount bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a banner urging that votes be counted is hung ouside a government building government opponents , including socialists and some centre right party supporters , marched along the cities main boulevard waving placards .
screens showing anti-government documentaries were set up in the square where the protests have been taking place , along with signs saying " ' open the ballot boxes " and " where is my voice ? "
the socialists have refused to enter parliament until the ballot boxes that were ruled " irregular " by election authorities are considered .
" now , more than ever , we want to prove that the freedom of the vote and the right to count it honestly can not be bought , sold or negotiated , " socialist leader and mayor of tirana edi told the crowd .
" unless the ballot boxes are opened , we will not just refuse to return to parliament , but shall escalate our protest , " he said .
claims of corruption rama claimed that prime minister berisha has restricted the freedom of judges and the media .
both political adversaries accuse each other of corruption .
berisha told parliament on thursday that there would be no recount .
" opening the ballots will not happen either here on land or in the sky , " he said .
" this coalition is going to run its full term . "
albania 's conservative democratic party holds 70 of albania 's 140 parliamentary seats , and is governing with the support of political allies .
the socialists won 66 seats , the closest since the country abandoned communism in 1992 .
observers from the organization for security and co-operation in europe osce said that despite improvements in the country 's election process , there had been " violations " . rc / afp / ap / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 21.11.2009 the german language should be promoted , says politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someworry about the future of the german language wolfgang boernsen is a member of the german parliament and in favor of declaring german as germany 's official language in the country 's constitution .
he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .
a bricklayer by trade , he comes from flensburg in northern germany and studied in the city of kiel .
he spent one semester as an exchange student in the usa and assisted with development aid in india .
he is a high school teacher and an assistant lecturer who enjoys cultivating his northern german dialect and has written a book about it .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .
the guests scored a couple of goals fairly early in the second half , and although frankfurt clawed one back , they could n't find the equalizer .
eleventh-placed frankfurt still sit one spot above gladbach in the league . the evening fixture between borussia dortmund and mainz was a non-starter , with the fans in dortmund 's westfalen stadium treated to a goalless bore draw . finally , in stuttgart , bottom-of-the-table hertha berlin managed to salvage a point against fellow under-achievers stuttgart .
colombian newcomer adrian ramos put berlin ahead just after the restart , but berlin could n't hang on for the win , conceding a 73rd minute equalizer .
one point , however , was not enough to lift berlin off the bottom of the table , nor was it enough to get stuttgart out of the relegation zone . on sunday bayer leverkusen travel to bayern munich , and could go top if they get a result there .

he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .

the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .

members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .

penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

new defense minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg recently defended the actions of colonel klein .
" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .
" i told him that the german commitment regarding afghanistan is firm , " zu guttenberg told journalists after talks in washington .

but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de history -pipe- 21.11.2009 the " gentle revolution " and the birth of an independent slovakia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovak dissident leader alexander dubcek in prague on november 24 , 1989 in slovakia the events of 1989 are remembered as the " gentle revolution " marked by non-violent demonstrations .
but the changes also led to the break up of czechoslovakia - into the czech republic and slovakia . czechoslovakia 's revolution against communist oppression got underway on november 16 , 1989 when students took to the streets of bratislava , today the capital of slovakia .
officially they were commemomorating jan opletal , a czechoslovak student murdered in 1939 by the nazis .
a day later , young people in prague gathered for a rally .
but what began as a legal demonstration under the banner of the socialist youth movement quickly got out of hand , as students marched on the centre of prague shouting " freedom ! " and triggering the end of communism in czechoslovakia . the revolution brought freedom , but it also lead to the country being split in two - the czech republic and slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bratislava saw the first student demonstrations in czechoslovakia in bratislava just as in prague , students and artists led the velvet revolution - or " gentle revolution " as it was known in slovakia .
but unlike the november 17 crackdown in prague , the first demonstration in bratislava ended peacefully .
then when news of the police attack on students in prague reached bratislava - they were back on the streets to denounce it and form a committee known as the public against violence .
" we went to these demonstrations with my classmates and my friends here in bratislava , " tibor holoda told deutsche welle .
he was a 17-year-old student at the time .
" often we would go to some pub after the protests and i very well remember that moment when everything changed .
we were at a bar and there was a tv with the evening news . then came the announcement that the communist government had resigned . "
" the whole three storey pub went silent and suddenly everyone started ringing with their keys - that was the symbol of those demonstrations at the time .
it was like the last ringing of the bells - it was over for the old regime . "
the end of communism also sparked the end of czechoslovakia it was over for communism but few imagined that soon it would be over for the country known as czechoslovakia .
on december 29 , vaclav havel was elected to be the first non-communist president of the country . slovak dissident alexander dubcek - the one time leader of the prague spring in 1968 - became president of the parliament .
but soon after the first democratic elections in 1990 , separatist voices were to be heard in slovakia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alexander dubcek and vaclav havel in prague so the velvet revolution and the democracy that it brought also created the conditions for a velvet divorce .
it would take place within four years and it would mirror the revolution in its peaceful nature .
what 's remarkable about the division of czechoslovakia is that a majority of both czechs and slovaks wanted to stay together .
however slovaks could see that czechs were wealthier and most power was centred in prague .
negotiations towards an agreement on devolution of power or a confederation of two states failed and on july 17 , 1992 , slovakia declared its independence .
after prague accepted the secession , independence became a reality on january 1 , 1993 .
it was a remarkable example of a people gaining independence peacefully and was partly driven by the need of both countries to get on with developing their economies .
" slovakia was the less developed part of czechoslovakia and it was in much greater need of development and investment than the czech republic , " says ladislav kubis a former journalist , an organiser of the peace committee , and an eyewitness to the events .
" so czechs were able to develop and go ahead much faster than they would in czechoslovakia , " he says .
a tradition of non-violence today , there are mixed feelings about the break with prague .
many people found their friends and relatives suddenly living across the border in another country .
but what 's clear is that everyone is proud of the non-violent nature of both the revolution and the divorce some three years later .
" there was always in czechoslovakia a tradition of non- violent politics , " explains british historian adam roberts who himself was a witness to the events of both the prague spring and the velvet revolution .
" they 'd never had internal violence or coup d 'etats on a major scale .
so there was already a tradition of pursuing politics by non-violent means and i think that has been greatly reinforced by the experience of the velvet revolution . "

he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .
a bricklayer by trade , he comes from flensburg in northern germany and studied in the city of kiel .
he spent one semester as an exchange student in the usa and assisted with development aid in india .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .
where there is money , there is also corruption , " said zwanziger . player denies involvement vfl osnabrueck striker thomas reichenberger , who is among those alleged to be involved , appeared before fans to deny his guilt .
he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .
namur lost 2-0 . it is thought that through bribing players , coaches and officials , the group may have earned as much as 10 million euros placing bets in europe and asia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the match-fixing scandal is being investigated across nine european leagues the chairwoman of transparency international deutschland svlvia schenk demanded zero tolerance against this kind of fraud .
penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de language -pipe- 21.11.2009 the german language should be promoted , says politician großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : someworry about the future of the german language wolfgang boernsen is a member of the german parliament and in favor of declaring german as germany 's official language in the country 's constitution .
he also wants the eu to treat german better . deutsche welle : mr boernsen , if you could send an sms in german , would you finish it off with " hdgdl " -lrb- acronym for " i like you a lot " in german -rrb- and find it " cool " ? wolfgang boernsen : although i like the german language a lot , i find it decidedly " uncool " to send declarations of love via messaging systems .
i am old-fashioned in this regard . there are plans to make the german language official in the country 's constitution , the basic law .
should this status apply equally to the language of goethe as well as local dialects ? german is a living language in a state of constant development .
it has a great ability to absorb anglicisms and other foreign words , as well as dialects and sms jargon .
it does n't make sense to pitch goethe 's poetry against modern everyday speech or " youth talk . "
the constitutional status that i advocate acknowledges our fascinating , multifaceted , dynamic cultural treasure - the german language - as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang boernsen is not ashamed of his native dialect in the future , will german parliament members , for example , be banned from giving speeches if they use too many anglicisms ? no , a freely elected member of the german parliament may speak the way they grew up speaking .
parliamentary speeches are one of the most important means of communication between politicians and their voters .
for this reason , a politician thinks very carefully about how to reach their audience .
and we can see that anglicisms are not quite as common as it may seem - they make up only a fraction of our language . language is an important part of cultural identity .
it is therefore an integral part of germany ’ s image , which institutions like deutsche welle and the goethe institute convey to the world .
what role should politics play here ? the promotion of the german language is an integral part of our foreign cultural policy and educational policy .
this is why around the world there are german courses as goethe institutes and german-language shows on deutsche welle , which have regular listeners in places like south america .
the goal here is to maintain this trend .
since 2005 , since the german government has been led by the christian democrats , investment into foreign culture and education policies has increased .
the cultivation of the language is also legally regulated - for example , as the task of deutsche welle . germany is a country of exports .
is it also in our economic interest to promote german as a foreign language ? of course .
after all , trade and the economy ca n't function without communication .
for this reason , it 's crucial to have a common language .
it 's also important for us germans to learn other languages .
it 's nuisance for us that the eu has a cold relationship with the german language and translates many documents into english and french , but not german .
the european commission should finally change this , especially since german is the most widely spoken native language of the eu .
150 million people around the world speak german , which makes our language one of the five most-commonly spoken languages . wolfgang boernsen has been a member of the german parliament and the christian democratic union since 1987 .
a bricklayer by trade , he comes from flensburg in northern germany and studied in the city of kiel .
he spent one semester as an exchange student in the usa and assisted with development aid in india .
he is a high school teacher and an assistant lecturer who enjoys cultivating his northern german dialect and has written a book about it .

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he took hold of a microphone ahead of a third division clash with borussia dortmund 's second team on saturday . " i have had no contact with the betting mafia and have nothing to do with the betting scandal , " said reichenberger .
" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .
the newspaper listed details of games being investigated from switzerland , belgium , croatia and turkey . one , from the swiss second division , was yverdon sport against fc thun in april .
members of the away team are alleged to have been bribed 1,500 euros to lose by five goals , the final result being 5 -1 . players from belgium ’ s second division side ur namur were allegedly bribed to lose by two goals to oud-hevelee leuven in march .

penalties , controls and early warning system should be brought into place , she said , so that culprits could be dealt with severely .
schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the suit will seek compensation for the families of people killed in a controversial airstrike in afghanistan . relatives of those killed in an airstrike near kunduz , in northern afghanistan are seeking compensation from the german government .
on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .
if no settlement is reached , popal said , he would seek compensation for " the flawed and grossly negligent actions of the german forces . "

" we ca n't have our soldiers hampered by legal doubts , especially when they are forced to make decisions under extreme time pressure , " guttenberg said , calling the airstrike " militarily appropriate . "
afghan criticism in kunduz , the governor of the province , mohammed omar told the news magazine der spiegel that german military operations were too often hampered by hesitation and a general lack of action .
" when we call for assistance in a firefight , they often have to request an order from the headquarters in mazar-i-sharif .
and then they come too late , " omar said .
" if the germans do n't want to do the work , to be honest it would be better if they left our province , " omar said .
on friday , zu guttenberg met with us secretary of defense robert gates .
" i told him that the german commitment regarding afghanistan is firm , " zu guttenberg told journalists after talks in washington .

berlin wants to ensure that promises made by the us are kept if the suspects are found guilty . a team of observers from the german government is going to new york to oversee the trial of five suspects accused of orchestrating the september 11 terrorist attacks in the united states , the news magazine der spiegel reported on saturday .
the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .
" in this case we will observe very closely that the given assurances are kept , " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger said .
however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .
the defense lawyer for one of the accused , ramzi binalshibh , said that a conviction of his client would " scarcely be possible without evidence from germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de eastern europe -pipe- 21.11.2009 romanians reflect on life during communist era großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romania joined the eu on january 1 , 2007 romania 's communist regime crumbled in december 1989 , and dictator nicolae ceausescu and his wife were executed on christmas day .
two decades on , dw correspondent zack baddorf asked romanians to reflect on the changes . zack baddorf is a dw correspondent who lives in barlad , romania .
he spoke to various people in his community about what their lives were like under communism .
this is his personal account of those conversations .
it 's difficult for me , as an american , to picture what life was really like in romania during communism .
i 'm 26 and i was born in a middle-class suburb in the united states .
when i moved to romania as a peace corps volunteer last year , i arrived in a country that is an eu member , with plans to adopt the euro as its currency .
romania is also a member of nato .
it had troops in iraq and still has soldiers in afghanistan .
you can find free wi-fi internet in some public parks here .
the only obvious physical remnants of communism are the thousands of concrete pre-fab apartment blocks that line the streets in most cities and even in little towns in the countryside .
i teach english at a technical high school in barlad .
one evening , i was eating dinner with my colleague , anca sandu , 34 , and her husband .
since she 'd grown up under communism , i asked her what it was like .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : romanian dictator nicolae ceausescu was executed on christmas day , 1989 she said that , back then , people generally had more respect for their country , nationality and history .
and there were other positive things .
" everyone had a job , and everyone had a house , " she told me .
" the problem was that we were n't allowed access to information .
we were n't allowed to read writers who did n't have ceausescu 's approval .
we were n't allowed to travel abroad , or have friends from abroad .
on some days , we were n't allowed to drive . "
and then there were the food rations , she said : no more than half a loaf of bread , not too much meat , or sugar , and so on .
while we spoke , anca 's husband , vio , chopped potatoes and cooked them in a frying pan .
twenty years ago , if he 'd been cooking at 7:00 pm , he would 've been cooking by candlelight .
that 's because the communist government cut off electricity from 6:00 - 8:00 pm each night across the country to preserve energy .
a youngster at the time , vio remembers that he used that time to play with his friends .
at 8:00 pm , the kids would go home to join their parents in watching the only two hours of tv that were available in romania each day .
for children , there was a state-controlled cartoon show with a hero named mihaela .
" usually , mihaela talked about our great leader , " vio said with a laugh .
" first we had to listen to a song about our great leader .
then , there 'd be a story involving mihaela and the great leader . "
economic hardship has remained a survey conducted in 2007 found that about 79 percent of romanians now have cable tv .
in the sandu household , the tv set in the kitchen was tuned to a national news network .
we focused our attention briefly on a report about a meeting of the government 's ministry for family and labor issues .
the story 's message ?
life is hard , and expensive .
" is that true ? "
i asked my hosts .
" yes , it 's true , " said vio .
" these days , it 's true . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ceausescu 's death prompted battles between his supporters and reformers later , i ask liliana bobaru , 50 , a former factory worker in barlad , how she feels about the local economy today .
romania , after all , has the highest inflation rate in the eu , and about one in 10 people are unemployed .
" for me , life is tough , " liliana confirmed .
" the leu does n't have the value it used to .
now , you can go to the stores and you can buy anything , but there 's no money .
back then , we had money , but there was nothing to buy . "
mariana paveliu , a french teacher at the school where i work , said that the food rations and lack of consumer goods were n't the biggest problem back then .
she lived half of her life under communism , and did n't meet her father until she was 12 because he had been a political prisoner for 13 years .
he was accused of sympathizing with an anti-communist movement .
" communism leaves a bitter taste in my mouth , " she said , adding that she does n't harbor any nostalgia for the old way of life .
she complains that many of the higher-ups in the former communist government are still in positions of authority today , and that they still fail to recognize the merit of individual people .
new generation aware of responsibility romanians , of course , now live in a free society .
despite their hard-won liberties , many romanians i 've talked to are pessimistic about the future . but then i met 15-year-old antonia nita .
the ninth-grader never lived a day under communism , and is of the firm opinion that democracy is best not just for romania , but every country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the palace built by the former communist dictatorship was used as a venue for a nato summit in 2008 " what does democracy mean to you ? "
i asked her .
" democracy means power of the people , " she replied , adding : " power of the citizens , not just the power of single person or a group of people . "
she realizes that her generation has a lot to do to ensure that romania functions as a true democracy , but she 's optimistic .
" we 're all learning about what democracy means , " she said .
" we 're learning about how to improve our country and i hope it will be better in the future . "

hoffenheim also won easily in cologne , and hanover - still mourning the loss of keeper robert enke - lost out to schalke . home advantage was largely meaningless for the first fixtures of match day 13 in the bundesliga . only schalke managed to deliver a win for their local supporters . schalke 's 2-0 victory came at the expense of hanover , the club that lost its star goalkeeper robert enke a few days ago .
players all over the league wore black armbands in memory of the international goalie and observed a minute 's silence in his honor . the hanover players all had enke 's number " 1 " emblazoned on their shirts in black . " it was a very difficult day , " admitted new hanover captain arnold bruggink .
" we had to get on with it after the minute 's silence , and once the game started we managed somehow .
we gave our all . " the match was understandably muted but still entertaining - schalke had the best of the play but made a host of mistakes in dangerous areas , allowing the visitors plenty of good chances .
however , schalke 's peruvian striker jefferson farfan grabbed the opener with around 20 minutes remaining , emphatically heading home a near-post corner .
in the dying moments farfan 's replacement , 20 year-old jan moravek , put the result beyond any doubt .
that win puts schalke third in the table , on 25 points . huge away wins bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim opened the scoring against cologne within five minutes werder bremen became the latest team to top the table - at least for the next 24 hours .
it destroyed freiburg 6-0 away from home , and now lead outright with 26 points .
german international playmaker mesut oezil was outstanding , scoring one goal , setting up three , and winning a penalty in the course of the match .
as the score-line suggests , bremen were in a different class throughout and could have won by an even greater margin . hoffenheim traveled well on saturday too , securing a 4-0 win in cologne .
carlos eduardo set the tone just five minutes into the game with a spectacular drive into the bottom corner from outside the area .
shinedu obasi added another a few minutes later , and strikers demba ba and vedad ibisevic both got on the score sheet in the second half .
cologne looked demoralized in the second half , and many of the home supporters who stayed to watch the full ninety minutes did so with their backs turned in protest against their team 's performance . around the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fans across the country paid tribute to deceased goalie robert enke defending champions wolfsburg slipped up again on saturday , losing 3-2 to nuremberg in their own back yard .
swiss goal poacher albert bunjaku grabbed a brace , but the stoppage-time winner came from midfielder peer kluge , securing three crucial points for newly-promoted nuremberg who are likely to fight for their survival this season .
wolfsburg , on the other hand , have dropped further adrift of the european qualification spots , lying seventh in the table . two of the most impressive relegation candidates this season - borussia mönchengladbach and frankfurt - faced each other , with gladbach coming out 2-1 winners on the road .
the guests scored a couple of goals fairly early in the second half , and although frankfurt clawed one back , they could n't find the equalizer .
eleventh-placed frankfurt still sit one spot above gladbach in the league . the evening fixture between borussia dortmund and mainz was a non-starter , with the fans in dortmund 's westfalen stadium treated to a goalless bore draw . finally , in stuttgart , bottom-of-the-table hertha berlin managed to salvage a point against fellow under-achievers stuttgart .
colombian newcomer adrian ramos put berlin ahead just after the restart , but berlin could n't hang on for the win , conceding a 73rd minute equalizer .
one point , however , was not enough to lift berlin off the bottom of the table , nor was it enough to get stuttgart out of the relegation zone . on sunday bayer leverkusen travel to bayern munich , and could go top if they get a result there .

investigators have the results of 32 matches in germany in their sights , including four in the second division , three in the third , 23 games in regional leagues and two under-19 games . zwanziger said that players and officials involved in corruption in the country would be brought to account as soon as evidence was submitted . he said that the sport would take all disciplinary measures within its power , and could press for legal action to be brought . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german football association president theo zwanziger promises tough penalties for match-fixers " we will punish these people - they do not belong amongst us .

" i have never manipulated a game , or taken money for it . "
club president dirk rasch has publicly given his support to the player . the extent of the europe-wide soccer match-fixing scandal was revealed on friday .
european football officials and german public prosecutors announced that more than 200 people were being investigated in a bribery racket .
the probe includes nine domestic leagues as well as the champions league and the new europa league . those under investigation are suspected having been involved in match fixing in the top-flight leagues of croatia , slovenia , turkey , hungary , bosnia-herzegovina and austria as well as lower divisions in germany , switzerland and belgium . low-profile games were targeted matches involved were usually of a low profile , with players bribed to lose by a particular number of goals , according to the sueddeutsche zeitung .

schenk added that the morality of players and officials should also be examined . " if so many games have been manipulated , a lot of people from the sport have taken part " , she said . " no need for new laws " justice minister sabine leutheusser-schnarrenberger has rejected any sharpening of the law to punish culprits .
she said that the sentences in the betting scandal of 2005 showed that existing legislation could be used to effectively punish those involved in such activities . among those arrested last thursday were croatian brothers ante and milan sapina , who were at the centre of a match-fixing scandal that rocked germany in 2004 . that scandal saw referee robert hoyzer jailed the following year when he admitted receiving almost 70,000 euros a plasma television for throwing games. rc / afp / dpa / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in opening remarks , medvedev also went after political corruption . russian prime minister vladimir putin has publically backed president dmitry medvedev 's call for radical economic modernization , amid rumors of a clash between the two leaders .
during his state-of-the-nation address on november 12 , medvedev urged russia to end its dependence on oil and gas exports and modernize the economy , which some analysts interpreted as a challenge to putin .
" i am sure that this call reflects the mood of all of russian society , " putin said in a keynote speech to the annual congress of the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg .
" the crisis , with all its severity , has shown how costly it is for a country to reject innovation , have low work productivity , waste resources and have a slow bureaucracy , " putin said .
" the president posed the question about the necessary , thorough modernization of the russian economy - overcoming chronic backwardness and moving the country to a more modern level of development , " putin added .
he also said russia 's gdp would shrink by 8.0 - 8.5 percent this year .
" bad political habits " in a brief opening speech , president dmitry medvedev also criticized leaders of russia 's ruling party for " bad political habits " and demanded that future elections be conducted fairly .
" elections which are intended to be … a competition of ideas and programs , are sometimes turned into affairs in which democratic procedures are confused with administrative ones , " the president said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin spoke to the ruling united russia party in st. petersburg " we need to learn to win - all of us , in fact - we need to learn to win in open contests , " he added .
the speeches by medvedev and putin were presented to more than 600 party delegates and broadcast live on state television .
putin did not mention medvedev 's criticism of the political system , but cautioned the united russia members against viewing their party as an " elite prestige club " for their own benefit .
united russia holds 315 out of 450 seats in the lower house of parliament .
last month , opposition parties stormed out of the chamber in protest , after claiming vote rigging had helped the united russia party to win in local elections. vj / afp / reuters / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the federal trial of the suspect khalid sheikh mohammed and his four co-defendants was announced on november 13 by the us justice department .
the government also asserted that it intends to seek the death penalty if the accused are found guilty .
germany , which does not have a death penalty , provided evidence for the trial on the condition that it could not be used to support a death sentence .
several members of the al qaeda cell that planned and executed the attacks of september 11 were previously based in the northern german city of hamburg .

however it was unclear exactly how evidence from germany would be distinguished from evidence procured from elsewhere .

on saturday , karim popal , a lawyer acting on the behalf of 78 family members of the victims , told the weser-kurier newspaper that he was preparing a class-action suit against the government .
the airstrike had been called in on the location of two fuel tanker trucks that had been hijacked by the taliban .
up to 142 people were killed in the bombardment , including civilians .
the commander who called in the strike , colonel georg klein , has cited the imminent threat of the tankers to the nearby german military base as justification for the bombardment .
a later nato report criticized the german commander for overstepping his authority .
germany has some 4,500 soldiers in afghanistan , the third-largest number of troops in the nato contingent .
based near the northern city of kunduz , soldiers have had to strike back against an increasingly fierce campaign by taliban insurgents .
seeking damages popal said he had recently visited afghanistan to gather and prepare material for his case . he told the weser kurier that he hopes to settle with the government out of court with payment to the families .

under a plea deal , mr myers will spend the rest of his life in jail while wife gwendolyn , 71 , will serve a term of no more than seven-and-a-half years .
she pleaded guilty to a lesser charge of conspiracy to gather and transmit national defence information to cuba .
the couple also agreed to forfeit $ 1.7m -lrb- £ 1m -rrb- in assets - including a washington dc apartment and a 37-ft yacht - an amount equal to the total salary he earned from the state department .
shopping trolley swaps they have been in custody since being arrested in june , following an undercover fbi sting operation . "
for the past 30 years , this couple betrayed america 's trust by covertly providing classified national defence information to the cuban goverment " david kris assistant attorney general myers was known as agent 202 , while his wife was agent 123 , according to court documents .
prosecutors say the couple were recruited three decades ago while living in south dakota by a cuban intelligence agent , who had met myers during his previous role at the state department .
in 1981 , the husband and wife returned to washington where myers got a job back at the state department and worked his way up .
us authorities say that from 1983 until this year the couple had a shortwave radio to receive messages from the cuban government .
they also delivered government secrets by swapping shopping trolleys with their cuban handlers at stores , and spent an evening with then-cuban leader fidel castro in 1995 , say officials .
the us justice department said the case should serve notice that america remained vigilant in protecting its secrets .
" for the past 30 years , this couple betrayed america 's trust by covertly providing classified national defence information to the cuban government , " david kris , assistant attorney general for national security , said in a statement .
but the couple 's lawyer , bradford berenson , said they had acted " not out of selfish motive or hope of personal gain , but out of conscience and personal commitment " , reports ap news agency .

pope benedict 's proposal would allow anglicans to convert while preserving many of their traditions and practices .
the archbishop , dr rowan williams , has said he does not believe the initiative will harm relations .
however , some anglicans have accused the pope of interfering at a sensitive time for the church of england .
the vatican says its invitation came in response to pleas from anglicans unhappy about the creation of women bishops .
bbc religious affairs correspondent robert pigott said : " dr williams says he accepts it was not intended to poach clergy or undermine relations .
' no unity ' " but he will go into his meeting with pope benedict knowing the nature of that relationship has changed .
the roman catholic church has all but given up on the idea of unity with anglicans . "
dr williams has signalled that he would like to build a new relationship , emphasising shared fundamental beliefs rather than " negative " secondary issues such as women clergy , our correspondent added .
another cause of discord in the worldwide anglican communion has been the election of an openly gay bishop and the blessing of same-sex unions .
under the terms of the pope 's proposed apostolic constitution , groupings of anglicans would be able to join " personal ordinariates " .
this would allow them to enter full communion with the catholic church , but also preserve elements of the anglican traditions including the possible use of anglican prayer books .
the first english clergy could convert early next year .

the resolution also repeated annual criticism of iran 's human rights record , including the use of torture and an increasing execution rate .
it urged tehran to end persecution of political opponents and release those imprisoned for their political views .
iran 's un ambassador dismissed the resolution as politically motivated .
mohammad khazaee said such measures had " created an atmosphere of confrontation and polarisation " at the un .
friday 's text was approved by 74 votes to 48 with 59 abstentions , which the us said was " the largest vote margin on such a resolution on iran in the un ever " .
' deep concern ' deputy state department spokesman robert wood said it demonstrated the international community was " deeply concerned " about the human rights situation in iran .
powers ' disappointed ' by response q & a : nuclear issue the resolution expresses " deep concern at serious ongoing and recurring human rights violations " in iran .
but it said there was " particular concern " at the iranian government 's response to the 12 june elections and the " concurrent rise in human rights violations " .
it comes as the major powers said they were disappointed with iran 's response to an offer of a deal over its nuclear programme .
president mahmoud ahmandinejad was declared the winner of june 's election , resulting in large scale protests by supporters of opposition candidates who said the poll had been rigged .
the un committee criticised the subsequent " harassment , intimidation and persecution , including by arbitrary arrest , detention or disappearance " of opponents of the government .
it also condemned alleged abuses of those in prison and " numerous deaths and injuries " in the crackdown .
the bbc 's barbara plett in new york says some of those countries which did not vote for the resolution did have concerns about the state of political rights in iran , but objected to the practice of singling out specific countries for condemnation .
saudi arabia broke ranks with muslim nations and voted in favour of the resolution , possibly because it accuses iran of backing shia rebels in neighbouring yemen , says our correspondent .
on friday , following meetings in brussels , the six world powers negotiating with iran said they were disappointed by tehran 's failure to respond positively to a recent deal on its nuclear programme .
iran has rejected the offer , which would allow it to continue to develop a nuclear reactor by exporting uranium to other countries to be enriched .

the most widely used picture shows emergency crews carrying an elderly woman over a wall and into an inflatable dinghy .
alongside it , the times has the headline : " once every 1,000 years rain falls like this . "
coverage in the sun focuses on the death of the police officer , bill barker , who the mirror describes as the " hero of the floods " .
troops out ?
according to the telegraph 's main story , the conservatives plan to pull british forces out of germany if they win power .
shadow defence secretary liam fox tells the paper their withdrawal would be designed to free troops for operations outside europe .
the guardian leads with an interview with foreign secretary david miliband .
in it , he warns that the afghan government could fall within weeks if nato troops pulled out now .
fourth choice the telegraph reports that lady ashton was britain 's fourth choice candidate for the new post of european union high representative for foreign affairs .
it says british and european officials have disclosed that david miliband and two others were considered before her .
business secretary lord mandelson was tempted but concluded his first duty was to stay with the prime minister , says the times .
it adds that ex-defence secretary geoff hoon had " only a flicker of support " .
marmite madness finally , the hunt is on for what the sun calls the thief on britain 's oddest crime spree - stealing only jars of marmite .
the man has targeted a petrol station shop in northamptonshire four times , clearing out its entire stock of jars .
on one occasion , the mail says , he left two jars behind and came back for them the following night .
the thief has proved so persistent , the paper adds , that the manager has now stopped selling marmite .

the uk , czech republic and poland have negotiated opt-outs from the charter .
but here damian chalmers , professor of eu law at the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- , argues that the charter repackages eu law that is already applied by the 27-nation bloc .
when it was proclaimed and signed in 2000 , the eu charter of fundamental rights was praised by the uk government .
the uk minister for europe , keith vaz , said : " it will be one of the most important things that we have seen come out of the european union in the last decade . "
fast forward to today , however , and it is not just the uk government but also the poles and czechs who are rushing to save themselves from it .
each has secured a full opt-out from the charter .
so what does the charter mean for people in the uk ?
former prime minister tony blair told parliament that he had obtained an opt-out from the charter .
if so why worry , as it will not affect us ?
well , the conservative party is anxious and wants a new opt-out because it believes the charter will affect us .
this confusion is caused by two things .
first , there is a world of difference between what the charter says and what it does , and it is this gap that provokes a lot of anxiety .
secondly , neither of the main parties has explained to the british public that the charter is only a bit-player in the application of eu fundamental rights law to the uk .
rights galore the charter is possibly the most wide-ranging human rights treaty in the world today .
there are civil rights , political rights , social rights , ecological entitlements , rights for the arts , consumer rights .
the list is really extensive .
eu charter of fundamental rights adopted by eu in 2000 becomes legally binding under lisbon treaty gathers together whole range of civil , political , economic and social rights of eu citizens in one text charter - key points charter in full whilst the charter might set out many desirable things , the concern has always been that every one of these grounds gives the eu new reasons to intervene , be it to protect the environment , workers , or the right to asylum .
that scares those worried about national sovereignty and raises fears that the rights might be developed in a clumsy way .
yet what the charter actually does is far more limited .
it does not give us the general right to challenge our police force , lawmakers or employers whenever they appear to breach these rights : the important catch is that it only binds eu institutions and member states when they are implementing eu law .
the european commission , parliament and council can be reviewed for compliance with the charter , but the uk government can only be reviewed when it applies eu law or transposes them .
this is quite a limited array of circumstances .
these circumstances are further restricted by widespread acceptance that many of the charter 's provisions , notably its social ones , can not be directly invoked before the courts .
old wine in new bottles it is not only the charter 's remit that is limited , but also its legal force , as the charter repackages old wine in new bottles .
when applying eu law , our government has been bound by eu fundamental rights norms for 18 years now .
all the charter did was to create a single document assembling all these obligations in one place .
but the law that underpins the charter continues to bind us , whether we opt out of the charter or not .
the fact this has gone unnoticed shows how little impact this law has had .
it is here that the british political parties have not been frank .
the labour government tried to deal with this problem by adopting a protocol that requires courts not to " extend " eu fundamental rights law using the charter , but allows them to " interpret " it .
it then presented it as an opt-out , when it clearly is not .
the charter will be applied by british courts .
does it matter ?
the conservatives , by contrast , have stated that they want a full opt-out from the charter .
it will not be applied by british courts or by the european court of justice in cases involving the uk .
they have been coy in saying whether this opt-out applies to other eu fundamental rights law that binds us just as tightly .
confusing , certainly , but does any of this matter ?
well , the european court of justice did not wait for the lisbon treaty and has actually been applying the charter since 2006 .
mischievous , certainly , but also unnoticed , as it was simply a continuation of existing case law , which shows great deference to national governments in fundamental rights cases .
whilst eu fundamental rights law says a lot of things , it rarely tells us to change our lives .
that is why it might be a while before we hear about the charter again .

all the charter did was to create a single document assembling all these obligations in one place .
but the law that underpins the charter continues to bind us , whether we opt out of the charter or not .
the fact this has gone unnoticed shows how little impact this law has had .
it is here that the british political parties have not been frank .
the labour government tried to deal with this problem by adopting a protocol that requires courts not to " extend " eu fundamental rights law using the charter , but allows them to " interpret " it .
it then presented it as an opt-out , when it clearly is not .
the charter will be applied by british courts .
does it matter ?
the conservatives , by contrast , have stated that they want a full opt-out from the charter .
it will not be applied by british courts or by the european court of justice in cases involving the uk .
they have been coy in saying whether this opt-out applies to other eu fundamental rights law that binds us just as tightly .
confusing , certainly , but does any of this matter ?
well , the european court of justice did not wait for the lisbon treaty and has actually been applying the charter since 2006 .
mischievous , certainly , but also unnoticed , as it was simply a continuation of existing case law , which shows great deference to national governments in fundamental rights cases .
whilst eu fundamental rights law says a lot of things , it rarely tells us to change our lives .
that is why it might be a while before we hear about the charter again .

when it was proclaimed and signed in 2000 , the eu charter of fundamental rights was praised by the uk government .
the uk minister for europe , keith vaz , said : " it will be one of the most important things that we have seen come out of the european union in the last decade . "

former prime minister tony blair told parliament that he had obtained an opt-out from the charter .
if so why worry , as it will not affect us ?
well , the conservative party is anxious and wants a new opt-out because it believes the charter will affect us .
this confusion is caused by two things .
first , there is a world of difference between what the charter says and what it does , and it is this gap that provokes a lot of anxiety .
secondly , neither of the main parties has explained to the british public that the charter is only a bit-player in the application of eu fundamental rights law to the uk .

eu charter of fundamental rights adopted by eu in 2000 becomes legally binding under lisbon treaty gathers together whole range of civil , political , economic and social rights of eu citizens in one text charter - key points charter in full whilst the charter might set out many desirable things , the concern has always been that every one of these grounds gives the eu new reasons to intervene , be it to protect the environment , workers , or the right to asylum .
that scares those worried about national sovereignty and raises fears that the rights might be developed in a clumsy way .
yet what the charter actually does is far more limited .
it does not give us the general right to challenge our police force , lawmakers or employers whenever they appear to breach these rights : the important catch is that it only binds eu institutions and member states when they are implementing eu law .
the european commission , parliament and council can be reviewed for compliance with the charter , but the uk government can only be reviewed when it applies eu law or transposes them .
this is quite a limited array of circumstances .
these circumstances are further restricted by widespread acceptance that many of the charter 's provisions , notably its social ones , can not be directly invoked before the courts .

the uk , czech republic and poland have negotiated opt-outs from the charter .
but here damian chalmers , professor of eu law at the london school of economics -lrb- lse -rrb- , argues that the charter repackages eu law that is already applied by the 27-nation bloc .
when it was proclaimed and signed in 2000 , the eu charter of fundamental rights was praised by the uk government .
the uk minister for europe , keith vaz , said : " it will be one of the most important things that we have seen come out of the european union in the last decade . "

so what does the charter mean for people in the uk ?
former prime minister tony blair told parliament that he had obtained an opt-out from the charter .
if so why worry , as it will not affect us ?
well , the conservative party is anxious and wants a new opt-out because it believes the charter will affect us .
this confusion is caused by two things .
first , there is a world of difference between what the charter says and what it does , and it is this gap that provokes a lot of anxiety .
secondly , neither of the main parties has explained to the british public that the charter is only a bit-player in the application of eu fundamental rights law to the uk .
rights galore the charter is possibly the most wide-ranging human rights treaty in the world today .
there are civil rights , political rights , social rights , ecological entitlements , rights for the arts , consumer rights .
the list is really extensive .
eu charter of fundamental rights adopted by eu in 2000 becomes legally binding under lisbon treaty gathers together whole range of civil , political , economic and social rights of eu citizens in one text charter - key points charter in full whilst the charter might set out many desirable things , the concern has always been that every one of these grounds gives the eu new reasons to intervene , be it to protect the environment , workers , or the right to asylum .
that scares those worried about national sovereignty and raises fears that the rights might be developed in a clumsy way .
yet what the charter actually does is far more limited .
it does not give us the general right to challenge our police force , lawmakers or employers whenever they appear to breach these rights : the important catch is that it only binds eu institutions and member states when they are implementing eu law .
the european commission , parliament and council can be reviewed for compliance with the charter , but the uk government can only be reviewed when it applies eu law or transposes them .
this is quite a limited array of circumstances .
these circumstances are further restricted by widespread acceptance that many of the charter 's provisions , notably its social ones , can not be directly invoked before the courts .
old wine in new bottles it is not only the charter 's remit that is limited , but also its legal force , as the charter repackages old wine in new bottles .

all the charter did was to create a single document assembling all these obligations in one place .

bethan parkinson , of rhydymain , near dolgellau , gwynedd , bought lucy the sheep for nine-year-old lauren .
when the animal needed a new home ms parkinson turned to an animal rescue centre in buckley , flintshire .
but when ms parkinson and her family turned up to take lucy to their new home , the centre claimed ownership .
officers from north wales police were called and ms parkinson was able to prove she had bought the animal and was allowed to take it home .
buckley town councillor joan glendenning , who runs the centre , then took legal action under the return of goods act . "
i was not impressed with evidence from miss parkinson " district judge harold godwin at a hearing at aberystwyth county court , district judge harold godwin found in ms glendenning 's favour .
ms glendenning , representing herself , told the court she had taken lucy in on the understanding the sheep would remain with her for the rest of its life .
she said that was the centre 's policy .
ms glendenning explained that ms parkinson knew this because she had handed another sheep , called teddy , over to her previously .
she added that she only accepted to take the sheep after numerous phone calls on 30 december last year , when ms parkinson said lucy might have to be put down .
ms parkinson told the court she had given lucy to ms glendenning temporarily after an attempt was made to set the sheep alight at a farm where she was being kept .
ms parkinson said she paid ms glendenning hundreds of pounds and worked voluntarily at her rescue centre to pay for lucy 's keep .
but this was disputed by ms glendenning , who told the hearing that caring for lucy was not a temporary arrangement .
she told the court she had received about £ 50 from ms parkinson towards a vet 's bill , and she had worked once a week at the rescue centre for a few weeks after persistently asking to help out .
" if this was a temporary arrangement she -lrb- lucy -rrb- would not have been there five months later , " ms glendenning told the court .
" that 's not a temporary arrangement . "
judge godwin said ms parkinson had tried to " backtrack " on the agreement with ms glendenning and it was not open to her to change her mind .
of ms parkinson 's court evidence , judge godwin said : " i was not impressed with the evidence from miss parkinson .
" i found it too fanciful and at times exaggerated and frankly unbelievable .
" the ownership of lucy remains with ms glendenning . "
judge godwin said he understood the independent police complaints commission -lrb- ipcc -rrb- had upheld a complaint made by ms glendenning against north wales police .
he said had it not been for the police force 's intervention , lucy would have remained in ms glendenning 's care .
judge godwin gave ms parkinson seven days to hand over the sheep and ordered her to pay £ 236.16 court costs .

five patients at cardiff 's university hospital of wales appear to have acquired the infection while being treated for other conditions .
they are thought to be the first confirmed person-to-person cases of a tamiflu-resistant strain in the world .
dr roland salmon said : " i would n't like people to go away with the idea that this is completely untreatable . "
there have been nearly 60 cases worldwide of people developing resistance to tamiflu but the virus has not passed on to others .
the uk has bought enough doses of tamiflu , which can shorten the duration of swine flu and reduce the risk of complications , for half the population .
so any spread of a tamiflu-resistant strain of the illness is a serious public health concern .
of the five people infected with the new strain in cardiff , two have recovered and been discharged , one is in intensive care and the other two are in isolation .
health officials have stressed there was no risk to anyone else and tests were being carried out to confirm exactly what happened .
dr salmon , director of the national public health service for wales communicable disease surveillance centre , said the emergence of a tamiflu-resistant strain was not unexpected in patients with serious underlying conditions and suppressed immune systems .
he said : " this is a very special set of circumstances , and it remains to be seen whether this would actually happen out in the community , where most of the people you would meet would have perfectly normal immune systems .
" one of the things this does say to us is , if anything , it makes vaccination more important and particularly vaccination of those people who have been top of the priority list , which is those people with underlying health conditions of the type which have given rise to the problem here . "
" the one medicine , an important medicine that we 've got a lot of , tamiflu , these patients have developed resistance to .
" however there is another perfectly good treatment , relenza or zanamirvir , which are still available and to which these virus are not only sensitive but , for various biological reasons , we expect to remain sensitive . "
wales 's chief medical officer dr tony jewell has said treatment with tamiflu was still appropriate for swine flu and people should continue to take tamiflu when they are prescribed it .
according to latest figures , 46 people are currently being treated in hospitals across wales for swine flu .
there have been a total of 21 swine flu-related deaths in wales .
an equivalent of 1,350 people have contacted their gps over the last seven days with flu-like symptoms .

five patients at cardiff 's university hospital of wales appear to have acquired the infection while being treated for other conditions .
they are thought to be the first confirmed person-to-person cases of a tamiflu-resistant strain in the world .
dr roland salmon said : " i would n't like people to go away with the idea that this is completely untreatable . "
there have been nearly 60 cases worldwide of people developing resistance to tamiflu but the virus has not passed on to others .
the uk has bought enough doses of tamiflu , which can shorten the duration of swine flu and reduce the risk of complications , for half the population .
so any spread of a tamiflu-resistant strain of the illness is a serious public health concern .
of the five people infected with the new strain in cardiff , two have recovered and been discharged , one is in intensive care and the other two are in isolation .
health officials have stressed there was no risk to anyone else and tests were being carried out to confirm exactly what happened .
dr salmon , director of the national public health service for wales communicable disease surveillance centre , said the emergence of a tamiflu-resistant strain was not unexpected in patients with serious underlying conditions and suppressed immune systems .
he said : " this is a very special set of circumstances , and it remains to be seen whether this would actually happen out in the community , where most of the people you would meet would have perfectly normal immune systems .
" one of the things this does say to us is , if anything , it makes vaccination more important and particularly vaccination of those people who have been top of the priority list , which is those people with underlying health conditions of the type which have given rise to the problem here . "
" the one medicine , an important medicine that we 've got a lot of , tamiflu , these patients have developed resistance to .
" however there is another perfectly good treatment , relenza or zanamirvir , which are still available and to which these virus are not only sensitive but , for various biological reasons , we expect to remain sensitive . "
wales 's chief medical officer dr tony jewell has said treatment with tamiflu was still appropriate for swine flu and people should continue to take tamiflu when they are prescribed it .
according to latest figures , 46 people are currently being treated in hospitals across wales for swine flu .
there have been a total of 21 swine flu-related deaths in wales .
an equivalent of 1,350 people have contacted their gps over the last seven days with flu-like symptoms .

climate change : methodology questioned hacked e-mails have raised questions on climate change data scientists at the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia are facing a fierce attack from climate sceptics following the hacking of the university 's computer .
the hacker stole thousands of e-mails and data .
much of it has been posted on the web .
and some of the e-mails are causing acute embarrassment .
my contacts at the cru tell me the e-mails are being taken out of context and insist they are part of the normal hurly-burly of conversations between scientists working on some of the most complicated questions of our times .
they ask how many of us would feel completely comfortable if our own inboxes were emptied out for the world to see .
how much of what we had said to close colleagues in industry jargon would be liable to misinterpretation ?
" if the ipcc -lrb- intergovernmental panel on climate change -rrb- ca n't do closed e-mail , no-one with any expertise could do anything .
i do n't know how you are supposed to work if you do n't have e-mail , " my source said .
but the e-mail stash is proving a treasure trove for sceptics who have challenged every facet of climate science and policy .
some of the e-mails reveal the frustration and annoyance among mainstream climate researchers about the probings they face from critics who relentlessly question their methodology .
and although my contact insists that the e-mails are about how data is presented and interpreted , sceptics say the e-mailers may have been discussing how the data could be manipulated .
the cru has been repeatedly asked to publish the entire data set from which it compiled an important grid-based record of global temperatures .
it says it will publish full details when it has clearance from all the world 's meteorological offices whose permission is needed .
but speaking to my source at the cru , it is also clear that the unit has been dragged down by what it considers to be nit-picking and unreasonable demands for data - and that there is personal animus against their intellectual rivals .
now this sort of hostility is nothing new in academia - but the revelations come at a sensitive time as the world 's nations gather for the climate meeting in copenhagen .
my cru source points out that its unpublished full data set is almost identical to the ones at the national climatic data center and the goddard institute of space studies .
both of these are in the us , where there are no restrictions on publication .
the cru view is that when the sceptics see the full data in due course they will be very disappointed .
the scientific establishment is likely to support the cru .
despite continuing uncertainties in some areas of climate science , they say officially that their overall confidence that humans are warming the climate is now more than 90 % .
one leading figure told me unofficially that confidence was now at 99 % .
but the email controversy may prove an uncomfortable moment in the careers of some researchers in the spotlight and will undoubtedly provoke demands for renewed scrutiny of the cru 's influential work .
these demands may surface in the us senate , where climate change sceptics and their allies are holding up the energy and climate bill which president obama needs before he can sign a legally-binding agreement over cutting emissions .
myron ebell , a climate sceptic from the competitive enterprise institute , which is funded by us business interests , told me : " we sceptics have been winning the argument for some time and this will further undermine confidence in ipcc science .
" this is very embarrassing indeed for the scientists behind these emails . "
the climate science website realclimate sees the cru computer raid as the latest attempt by lobbyists to discredit mainstream climate science at a critical time .
it explains in detail what it says is the legitimate scientific rationale behind some of the apparently incriminating emails , and says they offer a glimpse into the real world of science .
it says people should not be shocked by " scientists who are friendly and agree on many of the big picture issues , disagreeing at times about details and engaging in ' robust ' discussions ; scientists expressing frustration at the misrepresentation of their work in politicized arenas and complaining when media reports get it wrong ; scientists resenting the time they have to take out of their research to deal with over-hyped nonsense ...
" it 's obvious that the noise-generating components of the blogosphere will generate a lot of noise about this , " says realclimate .
" but it 's important to remember that gravity is n't a useful theory because newton was a nice person . "

climate change : methodology questioned hacked e-mails have raised questions on climate change data scientists at the climatic research unit at the university of east anglia are facing a fierce attack from climate sceptics following the hacking of the university 's computer .
the hacker stole thousands of e-mails and data .
much of it has been posted on the web .
and some of the e-mails are causing acute embarrassment .
my contacts at the cru tell me the e-mails are being taken out of context and insist they are part of the normal hurly-burly of conversations between scientists working on some of the most complicated questions of our times .
they ask how many of us would feel completely comfortable if our own inboxes were emptied out for the world to see .
how much of what we had said to close colleagues in industry jargon would be liable to misinterpretation ?
" if the ipcc -lrb- intergovernmental panel on climate change -rrb- ca n't do closed e-mail , no-one with any expertise could do anything .
i do n't know how you are supposed to work if you do n't have e-mail , " my source said .
but the e-mail stash is proving a treasure trove for sceptics who have challenged every facet of climate science and policy .
some of the e-mails reveal the frustration and annoyance among mainstream climate researchers about the probings they face from critics who relentlessly question their methodology .
and although my contact insists that the e-mails are about how data is presented and interpreted , sceptics say the e-mailers may have been discussing how the data could be manipulated .
the cru has been repeatedly asked to publish the entire data set from which it compiled an important grid-based record of global temperatures .
it says it will publish full details when it has clearance from all the world 's meteorological offices whose permission is needed .
but speaking to my source at the cru , it is also clear that the unit has been dragged down by what it considers to be nit-picking and unreasonable demands for data - and that there is personal animus against their intellectual rivals .
now this sort of hostility is nothing new in academia - but the revelations come at a sensitive time as the world 's nations gather for the climate meeting in copenhagen .
my cru source points out that its unpublished full data set is almost identical to the ones at the national climatic data center and the goddard institute of space studies .
both of these are in the us , where there are no restrictions on publication .
the cru view is that when the sceptics see the full data in due course they will be very disappointed .
the scientific establishment is likely to support the cru .
despite continuing uncertainties in some areas of climate science , they say officially that their overall confidence that humans are warming the climate is now more than 90 % .
one leading figure told me unofficially that confidence was now at 99 % .
but the email controversy may prove an uncomfortable moment in the careers of some researchers in the spotlight and will undoubtedly provoke demands for renewed scrutiny of the cru 's influential work .
these demands may surface in the us senate , where climate change sceptics and their allies are holding up the energy and climate bill which president obama needs before he can sign a legally-binding agreement over cutting emissions .
myron ebell , a climate sceptic from the competitive enterprise institute , which is funded by us business interests , told me : " we sceptics have been winning the argument for some time and this will further undermine confidence in ipcc science .
" this is very embarrassing indeed for the scientists behind these emails . "
the climate science website realclimate sees the cru computer raid as the latest attempt by lobbyists to discredit mainstream climate science at a critical time .
it explains in detail what it says is the legitimate scientific rationale behind some of the apparently incriminating emails , and says they offer a glimpse into the real world of science .
it says people should not be shocked by " scientists who are friendly and agree on many of the big picture issues , disagreeing at times about details and engaging in ' robust ' discussions ; scientists expressing frustration at the misrepresentation of their work in politicized arenas and complaining when media reports get it wrong ; scientists resenting the time they have to take out of their research to deal with over-hyped nonsense ...
" it 's obvious that the noise-generating components of the blogosphere will generate a lot of noise about this , " says realclimate .
" but it 's important to remember that gravity is n't a useful theory because newton was a nice person . "

five hundred invitations were sent out to leading figures in the arts around the world last september , and more than 250 acceptances have been received at the vatican .
among them are such well-known names such as anish kapoor , whose current exhibition at the royal academy in london is drawing crowds ; zaha hadid , the iraqi-born british architect whose striking new maxxi museum of modern art has just opened in rome ; daniel libeskind , the polish-born american who won the competition for the reconstruction of the world trade centre site in new york ; and f murray abraham , the american movie star of syrian descent who won an oscar for best actor for his role as salieri in the mozart film , amadeus , in 1985 .
it is an eclectic list in which italians outnumber all the foreigners .
among them are sculptor arnaldo pomodoro ; the doyen of film score composers , ennio morricone ; and opera star andrea bocelli .
for the moment , the vatican is being coy about revealing which artists refused the pope 's invitation or excused themselves on the grounds of a previous engagement .
the sistine chapel choir will welcome the artists with a motet by the 16th century composer palestrina as they troop into the awe-inspiring chapel where popes are elected , to hear extracts from a letter addressed by the late pope john paul ii to the world 's artists exactly 10 years ago .
pope benedict will then give his take on the long-established and rich connections between the catholic church as patron of most of the arts represented among his extensive guest list .
crucified frog popes love to lecture their guests .
john paul described artists as " ingenious creators of beauty " in his address on the eve of the new millennium , and distinguished between the roles of " creators " and " craftsmen " .
" the church needs art , " pope john paul wrote , " but can it also be said that art needs the church ? " he went on to ask .
in today 's growingly secular societies , art sometimes manages to offend the church . "
the building of these churches , and the pride the parishioners take in them , show that we have a dialogue with the architects of modernity " archbishop gianfranco ravasi a german artist , martin kippenberger , who exhibited a sculpture of a crucified frog at an art exhibition in bolzano in northern italy last year , caused a stir with the local ecclesiastical authorities .
pope benedict 's new reaching out to artists is being masterminded by his newly-appointed culture commissar , archbishop gianfranco ravasi , a biblical scholar , archaeologist and author , who now heads the pontifical council for culture and the church 's commission for cultural heritage .
within months of his appointment , archbishop ravasi was suggesting a vatican cultural presence not only at the venice biennale but at the frankfurt book fair and " an analogous presence in those places where the new artistic vocabulary is elaborated " .
addressing the issue of modern artists , he said in a recent interview with osservatore romano , the vatican daily , " experience tells me that there is less a preconceived attitude of rejection -lsb- on the artists ' part -rsb- than their conviction that the church has long since taken another route .
but when we show our interest , the responses we get are mostly positive " .
' devil 's work ' the vatican museums were opened 500 years ago . a number of factors subsequently weakened the artists ' relations with papal patronage .
unification of italy in 1870 reduced the vatican possessions from a large swath across the peninsula to just 110 acres .
as art trends gradually turned away from the figurative toward the abstract , many people , priests included , failed to keep up with the taste of art sophisticates .
" today our problem is to get ordinary people to welcome this type of art .
we need to help them to understand that art is part of the spirit , " archbishop ravasi said .
a number of roman catholic churches have been built recently by such renowned architects as renzo piano of italy , richard meier from america , and tadao ando of japan - and celebrated by parishioners as well as by architecture critics .
" the building of these churches , and the pride the parishioners take in them , show that we have a dialogue with the architects of modernity , " archbishop ravasi explains , " but there 's another problem here : often the great modern architects do not want interference with the purity of their buildings . "
this architectural purity can conflict with the church 's reliance upon religious symbols .
when a church is too lacking in the traditional symbols of catholicism , the parish priests tend to take their own initiatives , often with indifferent results , archbishop ravasi said .
changing parishioners ' taste will not be easy , he admits , even when a parish priest forsakes craft work for the avant-garde .
he tells the story of his introducing segments of modern music into the church liturgy on several occasions in milan .
" the church was filled with young people , " he said .
" it was a fine experience - but later i received letters of protest from older parishioners , some of whom considered the new music the devil 's work . "
a small collection of modern art was first put on view in the vatican as long ago as 1932 .
but it was pope paul vi who decided in the 1960s to extend the vatican 's huge collection of antique art to include major 20th century artists .
before the sistine chapel meeting , the invited artists are being taken on a guided tour of this collection which includes works by francis bacon , graham sutherland , matisse and georges rouault .
they will be gently encouraged to make a gift of one of their works to the vatican collection .
