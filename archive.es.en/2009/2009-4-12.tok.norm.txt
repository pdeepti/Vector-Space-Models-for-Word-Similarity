the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

" we are very happy .

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the lovable hare has been mighty successful at edging out jesus as the symbol of easter .
so just where did it and other easter traditions come from ? a recent study found that one in five germans had no idea what the original christian liturgical meaning of easter was .
nearly all , however , were familiar with the easter bunny .
perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .
it all started , says alois doering , an author of books on german traditions , as a way to keep kids happy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the easter bunny has a lot of fans " the catholic kids knew that easter meant they could eat eggs again , ” says doering , referring to the prohibition of dairy products during the lenten fast .
“ but how do you explain all the egg-eating to protestant children ?
where are all the eggs suddenly coming from ? ”
so protestants , says doering , made up a story about hares who brought baskets of eggs around to pious households .
the hare was probably chosen for the task because it had long been a symbol of fertility .
a joyful event another german easter tradition , this one catholic , is easter laughter .
beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .
the practice , though , is now making a comeback , among catholics and protestants alike , around the world as an easter monday activity .
fun with eggs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just the red egg please , i 'm orthodox decorating eggs is a tradition that has never been under threat .
according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .
the paint was also used to separate the blessed eggs from the un-blessed ones .
and , of course , most children just ca n't resist playing with all those eggs .
they hunt down those that have been hidden ; they race them against each other in roll-offs ; one particularly popular tradition in germany has two competitors knocking eggs against each other – with high stakes : the person holding the egg that breaks has to give it to their opponent -lrb- provided their egg did n't break too -rrb- .
doing the math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauss ' easter date predictions have , so far , been right on the money these easter traditions that have stood the test of time , says alois döring , are likely to stay with us .
and thanks to a revered old german we have a way of calculating on what date easter will fall , in perpetuity . it was the mathematician carl friedrich gauss who came up with an algorithm to predict the date of easter . “ if you use it correctly , ” says doering , “ you can figure out what the date of easter 3575 will be . ”
that date will be april 20th .

lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tens of thousands gathered to hear pope benedict 's easter mass the 81-year-old pontiff said he wanted this year 's easter message to convey the idea of peace and reconciliation in crisis zones all over the world . " africa suffers disproportionately from the cruel and unending conflicts , often forgotten , that are causing so much bloodshed and destruction in several of her nations , " he said , three weeks after his maiden trip to the continent as pope . the pontiff also said reconciliation among rival factions in the middle east was " difficult , but indispensable . " " reconciliation ... is a precondition for a future of overall security and peaceful coexistence , and it can only be achieved through renewed , persevering and sincere efforts to resolve the israeli-palestinian conflict , " he said .

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .

" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .
while the two parties do not plan to form a coalition , the conservatives have pledged to support lopez as head of the regional government later this month or in early may .
newspaper threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta says basque socialist patxi lopez will become a legitimate target when he becomes premier in a statement sent to the pro-independence basque newspaper gara , eta said it " did not recognize any democratic legitimacy of the new government which will be formed . "
" just as we warned that ibarretxe 's government would be the government of fraud for any basque nationalist , we now want to state that lopez 's government will be the government of fascism and the violation of rights , " the statement said .
" as long as there is no change in behaviour , the political leaders of that imposed structure will be eta 's priority target , " it added .
eta has killed more than 800 people since the 1960s in its violent campaign for an independent basque country made up of parts of northern spain and south-western france .

but the lovable hare has been mighty successful at edging out jesus as the symbol of easter .
so just where did it and other easter traditions come from ? a recent study found that one in five germans had no idea what the original christian liturgical meaning of easter was .
nearly all , however , were familiar with the easter bunny .
perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .
it all started , says alois doering , an author of books on german traditions , as a way to keep kids happy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the easter bunny has a lot of fans " the catholic kids knew that easter meant they could eat eggs again , ” says doering , referring to the prohibition of dairy products during the lenten fast .
“ but how do you explain all the egg-eating to protestant children ?
where are all the eggs suddenly coming from ? ”
so protestants , says doering , made up a story about hares who brought baskets of eggs around to pious households .
the hare was probably chosen for the task because it had long been a symbol of fertility .
a joyful event another german easter tradition , this one catholic , is easter laughter .
beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .
the practice , though , is now making a comeback , among catholics and protestants alike , around the world as an easter monday activity .
fun with eggs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just the red egg please , i 'm orthodox decorating eggs is a tradition that has never been under threat .
according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .
the paint was also used to separate the blessed eggs from the un-blessed ones .
and , of course , most children just ca n't resist playing with all those eggs .
they hunt down those that have been hidden ; they race them against each other in roll-offs ; one particularly popular tradition in germany has two competitors knocking eggs against each other – with high stakes : the person holding the egg that breaks has to give it to their opponent -lrb- provided their egg did n't break too -rrb- .
doing the math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauss ' easter date predictions have , so far , been right on the money these easter traditions that have stood the test of time , says alois döring , are likely to stay with us .
and thanks to a revered old german we have a way of calculating on what date easter will fall , in perpetuity . it was the mathematician carl friedrich gauss who came up with an algorithm to predict the date of easter . “ if you use it correctly , ” says doering , “ you can figure out what the date of easter 3575 will be . ”
that date will be april 20th .

the most recent cases of alcohol abuse by minors highlight a steady and alarming increase of binge drinking by german youths . " we are observing with concern that people being brought into hospital with suspected alcohol poisoning are getting younger and younger .
even kids under the age of 15 are coming to hospitals completely drunk , " norbert klusen , ceo of the tk health insurance company , told this weekend 's edition of the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . tk statistics revealed that between 2007 and 2008 considerably more children under the age of 15 had been taken to hospital because of presumed alcohol poisoning .
if extrapolated to all children in that age group this would add up to nearly 2,400 cases of alcohol abuse . the figures for adolescents under the age of 18 were equally sobering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when consumed in excess , alcopops can be just as harmful as other alcoholic drinks according to tk 's figures , the number of hospitalizations rose by 174 to 1,765 year-on-year .
if projected to all youths in that age bracket , this adds up to some 20,000 so-called " coma bingers . " klusen warned that supermarkets , gas stations and restaurant and pub owners had to take on more responsibility in checking the ages of their customers .
he said it was a problem " if a bottle of beer , a glass of wine and a cigarette while watching television with the family were always present . " the health expert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , karl lauterbach , demanded in the same newspaper that alcohol sales laws be tightened .
he said that all adolescents who want to purchase alcohol be required to show proper proof of age .
lauterbach also called for stiffer penalties for retailers and restaurant owners who illegally sell alcohol to minors . jk / msh , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de police investigate alcohol poisoning deaths turkish police have arrested two men suspected of causing the alcohol-related deaths of three german school students in the city of kemer , on turkey 's mediterranean coast .
-lrb- 07.04.2009 -rrb- germans turn to graphic images to combat drinking a new police-initiated campaign in germany tries to give young people a dose of reality by showing what drinking too much could do to them .
-lrb- 14.12.2008 -rrb- violent crimes committed by young people in germany rose by almost 5 percent in 2007 the increased readiness of young people to turn violent is at least partly linked to increased consumption of alcohol , says german interior minister wolfgang schäuble .

but the lovable hare has been mighty successful at edging out jesus as the symbol of easter .
so just where did it and other easter traditions come from ? a recent study found that one in five germans had no idea what the original christian liturgical meaning of easter was .
nearly all , however , were familiar with the easter bunny .
perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .
it all started , says alois doering , an author of books on german traditions , as a way to keep kids happy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the easter bunny has a lot of fans " the catholic kids knew that easter meant they could eat eggs again , ” says doering , referring to the prohibition of dairy products during the lenten fast .
“ but how do you explain all the egg-eating to protestant children ?
where are all the eggs suddenly coming from ? ”
so protestants , says doering , made up a story about hares who brought baskets of eggs around to pious households .
the hare was probably chosen for the task because it had long been a symbol of fertility .
a joyful event another german easter tradition , this one catholic , is easter laughter .
beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .
the practice , though , is now making a comeback , among catholics and protestants alike , around the world as an easter monday activity .
fun with eggs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just the red egg please , i 'm orthodox decorating eggs is a tradition that has never been under threat .
according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .
the paint was also used to separate the blessed eggs from the un-blessed ones .
and , of course , most children just ca n't resist playing with all those eggs .
they hunt down those that have been hidden ; they race them against each other in roll-offs ; one particularly popular tradition in germany has two competitors knocking eggs against each other – with high stakes : the person holding the egg that breaks has to give it to their opponent -lrb- provided their egg did n't break too -rrb- .
doing the math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauss ' easter date predictions have , so far , been right on the money these easter traditions that have stood the test of time , says alois döring , are likely to stay with us .
and thanks to a revered old german we have a way of calculating on what date easter will fall , in perpetuity . it was the mathematician carl friedrich gauss who came up with an algorithm to predict the date of easter . “ if you use it correctly , ” says doering , “ you can figure out what the date of easter 3575 will be . ”
that date will be april 20th .

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .

the most recent cases of alcohol abuse by minors highlight a steady and alarming increase of binge drinking by german youths . " we are observing with concern that people being brought into hospital with suspected alcohol poisoning are getting younger and younger .
even kids under the age of 15 are coming to hospitals completely drunk , " norbert klusen , ceo of the tk health insurance company , told this weekend 's edition of the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . tk statistics revealed that between 2007 and 2008 considerably more children under the age of 15 had been taken to hospital because of presumed alcohol poisoning .
if extrapolated to all children in that age group this would add up to nearly 2,400 cases of alcohol abuse . the figures for adolescents under the age of 18 were equally sobering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when consumed in excess , alcopops can be just as harmful as other alcoholic drinks according to tk 's figures , the number of hospitalizations rose by 174 to 1,765 year-on-year .
if projected to all youths in that age bracket , this adds up to some 20,000 so-called " coma bingers . " klusen warned that supermarkets , gas stations and restaurant and pub owners had to take on more responsibility in checking the ages of their customers .
he said it was a problem " if a bottle of beer , a glass of wine and a cigarette while watching television with the family were always present . " the health expert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , karl lauterbach , demanded in the same newspaper that alcohol sales laws be tightened .
he said that all adolescents who want to purchase alcohol be required to show proper proof of age .
lauterbach also called for stiffer penalties for retailers and restaurant owners who illegally sell alcohol to minors . jk / msh , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the lovable hare has been mighty successful at edging out jesus as the symbol of easter .
so just where did it and other easter traditions come from ? a recent study found that one in five germans had no idea what the original christian liturgical meaning of easter was .
nearly all , however , were familiar with the easter bunny .
perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .
it all started , says alois doering , an author of books on german traditions , as a way to keep kids happy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the easter bunny has a lot of fans " the catholic kids knew that easter meant they could eat eggs again , ” says doering , referring to the prohibition of dairy products during the lenten fast .
“ but how do you explain all the egg-eating to protestant children ?
where are all the eggs suddenly coming from ? ”
so protestants , says doering , made up a story about hares who brought baskets of eggs around to pious households .
the hare was probably chosen for the task because it had long been a symbol of fertility .
a joyful event another german easter tradition , this one catholic , is easter laughter .
beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .
the practice , though , is now making a comeback , among catholics and protestants alike , around the world as an easter monday activity .
fun with eggs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : just the red egg please , i 'm orthodox decorating eggs is a tradition that has never been under threat .
according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .
the paint was also used to separate the blessed eggs from the un-blessed ones .
and , of course , most children just ca n't resist playing with all those eggs .
they hunt down those that have been hidden ; they race them against each other in roll-offs ; one particularly popular tradition in germany has two competitors knocking eggs against each other – with high stakes : the person holding the egg that breaks has to give it to their opponent -lrb- provided their egg did n't break too -rrb- .
doing the math bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gauss ' easter date predictions have , so far , been right on the money these easter traditions that have stood the test of time , says alois döring , are likely to stay with us .
and thanks to a revered old german we have a way of calculating on what date easter will fall , in perpetuity . it was the mathematician carl friedrich gauss who came up with an algorithm to predict the date of easter . “ if you use it correctly , ” says doering , “ you can figure out what the date of easter 3575 will be . ”
that date will be april 20th .
get ready .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 12.04.2009 eta threatens incoming basque government großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : basque militants declared a ceasefire in 2006 , but resumed attacks 15 months later the armed basque separatist group eta has warned that the incoming government of the north-eastern spanish region lacks " democratic legitimacy " and would therefore become the organisation 's " priority target " . the leader of the basque socialist party , patxi lopez , is set to become the head of the regional basque government under a deal reached with the conservative popular party following local elections in march .
lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .
while the two parties do not plan to form a coalition , the conservatives have pledged to support lopez as head of the regional government later this month or in early may .
newspaper threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta says basque socialist patxi lopez will become a legitimate target when he becomes premier in a statement sent to the pro-independence basque newspaper gara , eta said it " did not recognize any democratic legitimacy of the new government which will be formed . "
" just as we warned that ibarretxe 's government would be the government of fraud for any basque nationalist , we now want to state that lopez 's government will be the government of fascism and the violation of rights , " the statement said .
" as long as there is no change in behaviour , the political leaders of that imposed structure will be eta 's priority target , " it added .
eta has killed more than 800 people since the 1960s in its violent campaign for an independent basque country made up of parts of northern spain and south-western france .
a lack of progress in peace talks with madrid saw a 15-month truce fail in mid-2007 .

lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .
while the two parties do not plan to form a coalition , the conservatives have pledged to support lopez as head of the regional government later this month or in early may .
newspaper threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta says basque socialist patxi lopez will become a legitimate target when he becomes premier in a statement sent to the pro-independence basque newspaper gara , eta said it " did not recognize any democratic legitimacy of the new government which will be formed . "
" just as we warned that ibarretxe 's government would be the government of fraud for any basque nationalist , we now want to state that lopez 's government will be the government of fascism and the violation of rights , " the statement said .
" as long as there is no change in behaviour , the political leaders of that imposed structure will be eta 's priority target , " it added .
eta has killed more than 800 people since the 1960s in its violent campaign for an independent basque country made up of parts of northern spain and south-western france .
a lack of progress in peace talks with madrid saw a 15-month truce fail in mid-2007 .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest on sunday the arrest of arisman pongruengrong follows prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's promise to take legal action against supporters of former primer minister thaksin shinawatra .
in a weekly televised address to the nation abhisit described the protesters as „ enemies of thailand “ and vowed that he would bring order and peace back to the fragmented country .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had made assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters , known as the „ red shirts , “ were regrouping outside of the prime minister 's office in bangkok .
they are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after taking office . abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power .
this came after anti-thaksin protesters occupied two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and the dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
prime minister abhisit has repeatedly resisted calls to step down despite the days of anti-government protests , both in bangkok and at the summit .
thaksin , who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid jail on a corruption conviction , called in to his supporters saturday , thanking them for their sacrifices .
missed opportunites at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the asean summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infratructure investment fund .
the asean meeting had already been delayed by clashes between anti-government and pro-government supporters .

the most recent cases of alcohol abuse by minors highlight a steady and alarming increase of binge drinking by german youths . " we are observing with concern that people being brought into hospital with suspected alcohol poisoning are getting younger and younger .
even kids under the age of 15 are coming to hospitals completely drunk , " norbert klusen , ceo of the tk health insurance company , told this weekend 's edition of the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . tk statistics revealed that between 2007 and 2008 considerably more children under the age of 15 had been taken to hospital because of presumed alcohol poisoning .
if extrapolated to all children in that age group this would add up to nearly 2,400 cases of alcohol abuse . the figures for adolescents under the age of 18 were equally sobering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when consumed in excess , alcopops can be just as harmful as other alcoholic drinks according to tk 's figures , the number of hospitalizations rose by 174 to 1,765 year-on-year .
if projected to all youths in that age bracket , this adds up to some 20,000 so-called " coma bingers . " klusen warned that supermarkets , gas stations and restaurant and pub owners had to take on more responsibility in checking the ages of their customers .
he said it was a problem " if a bottle of beer , a glass of wine and a cigarette while watching television with the family were always present . " the health expert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , karl lauterbach , demanded in the same newspaper that alcohol sales laws be tightened .
he said that all adolescents who want to purchase alcohol be required to show proper proof of age .
lauterbach also called for stiffer penalties for retailers and restaurant owners who illegally sell alcohol to minors . jk / msh , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crew members celebrate on the deck of the maersk alabama phillips ' crew set off flares , hoisted an american flag and jumped for joy at the news of their captain 's rescue .
" we are very happy .
he 's a hero , " one crew member of the maersk alabama shouted at journalists amid raucous celebrations on the deck of the vessel , docked in the kenyan port of mombasa .
in washington , president barack obama welcomed news of the rescue in a statement and said the us remained resolved to combat piracy off the somali coast . nrt / jk ap / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 12.04.2009 un security council draft statement condemns north korea großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the security council could impose fresh sanctions on north korea the five permanent un security council members and japan have reached an agreement on a draft statement condemning north korea 's recent rocket launch , diplomats said on saturday . “ the security council condemns the 5 april 2009 launch by the democratic people ’ s republic of korea -lrb- dprk -rrb- , which is in contravention of security council resolution 1718 , ” the un draft statement reads .
pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protest leader arisman pongreungrong may be feeling less victorious after his arrest on sunday the arrest of arisman pongruengrong follows prime minister abhisit vejjajiva 's promise to take legal action against supporters of former primer minister thaksin shinawatra .
in a weekly televised address to the nation abhisit described the protesters as „ enemies of thailand “ and vowed that he would bring order and peace back to the fragmented country .
ahead of the summit , the thai government had made assurances that it would take whatever measures necessary to prevent such a situation .
officials have now acknowledged that security forces had failed to do just that .
ongoing uncertainty thaksin 's supporters , known as the „ red shirts , “ were regrouping outside of the prime minister 's office in bangkok .
they are demanding abhisit 's resignation and new elections just four months after taking office . abhisit was installed as prime minister in a parliamentary vote after a court ruling removed thaksin 's allies from power .
this came after anti-thaksin protesters occupied two thai airports for a week .
four prime ministers over the last 15 months have failed in their attempts to stabilize the country and the dramatic evacuation of foreign leaders from the summit venue by helicopter is another embarrassment for the thai government .
prime minister abhisit has repeatedly resisted calls to step down despite the days of anti-government protests , both in bangkok and at the summit .
thaksin , who lives in self-imposed exile to avoid jail on a corruption conviction , called in to his supporters saturday , thanking them for their sacrifices .
missed opportunites at cancelled summit bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wen jiabao was meant to announce a multi-billion dollar investment fund at the summit the asean summit was meant to bring together southeast asian leaders with ministers from china , south korea , japan , india , australia and new zealand and un secretary general ban ki-moon to discuss the global financial crisis and north korea 's recent rocket launch .
asian leaders were also expected to sign an investment pact with china .
china has announced an offer of $ 15 billion in credit to asean countries and a $ 10 billion infratructure investment fund .
the asean meeting had already been delayed by clashes between anti-government and pro-government supporters .
thai officials now say talks will be held in about two months ' time . hf / pfd , afp / ap / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .
while the two parties do not plan to form a coalition , the conservatives have pledged to support lopez as head of the regional government later this month or in early may .
newspaper threat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eta says basque socialist patxi lopez will become a legitimate target when he becomes premier in a statement sent to the pro-independence basque newspaper gara , eta said it " did not recognize any democratic legitimacy of the new government which will be formed . "
" just as we warned that ibarretxe 's government would be the government of fraud for any basque nationalist , we now want to state that lopez 's government will be the government of fascism and the violation of rights , " the statement said .
" as long as there is no change in behaviour , the political leaders of that imposed structure will be eta 's priority target , " it added .
eta has killed more than 800 people since the 1960s in its violent campaign for an independent basque country made up of parts of northern spain and south-western france .

pyongyang has insisted that the rocket it launched on april 5 was a communications satellite which entered the orbit to beam back patriotic songs , but the united states , south korea and japan said the launch was actually a failed test of a long-range taepodong-2 missile .
after five permanent council members - china , united states , france , britain and russia - and japan met for informal talks on saturday , april 11 , french ambassador jean-maurice ripert told reporters the countries had agreed on draft text to be presented to partners in the security council .
" we made progress this morning , " ripert said .
" it is a text which sends out , as we intended , a clear message to north korea , expressing our disagreement with what happened , " he said .
" we will meet this afternoon with the other members of the council , and we hope to be able to reach an agreement soon . "
the 15-member council had already met on april 6 to discuss the launch , but diplomats failed at the time to agree on a joint resolution .
the draft statement will be put before the full 15 member security council on monday .
it needs unanimous approval to be adopted , but diplomats described this process as “ virtually assured ” .
violation of un resolution bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pyongyang says it only launched a satellite , the west suspects a missile test japan has vowed to continue pressing the security council to adopt a resolution stating that north korea 's launch violated previous un resolutions .
" we will continue maximum efforts to -lrb- secure -rrb- a resolution , " japan 's foreign affairs state secretary shintaro ito told reporters .
china and russia have been urging restraint , saying that an overreaction could harm prospects for resuming stalled six-party talks on north korea 's nuclear disarmament .
after north korea carried out a nuclear test in 2006 , the un security council passed resolution 1718 , forbidding north korea from conducting long-range missile tests .
the resolution also included sanctions on military goods and luxury products .
like japan , the united states had been pushing for tougher steps against pyongyang .
us ambassador to the un susan rice accepted the proposal , saying it was a strong and legally binding motion of the security council which would fulfil all of washington ’ s goals .
“ what the council can do , and we hope will do , through the adoption of this statement is to send a very clear message to north korea that what they have done under the guise of a satellite launch is in fact a violation of their obligations and indeed that there are consequences for such actions , ” rice told reporters .
tougher sanctions in store ?
the draft also calls for the un sanctions committee to begin enforcing financial sanctions and an arms embargo laid down in the existing council resolution 1718 .
the sanctions committee on north korea has not met for two years , and has not designated a single north korean company to be added to the un blacklist of banned entities , diplomats say .
the draft calls for the committee to designate “ entities and goods ” to face sanctions .
it adds that if the committee fails to do so by the end of the month , the security council will draw up its own list . msh / nrt / tt , afp / ap / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

lopez , who will replace juan jose ibarretxe of the moderately nationalist pnv party , will be the first basque premier to unequivocally back the region 's unity with spain since it was granted wide autonomy in 1979 .
although the pnv won more seats than any other party in the polls , it failed to secure a majority in the 75-member regional legislature .
the basque socialist party and the popular party combined have 38 seats - enough to end almost 30 years of pnv dominance .
while the two parties do not plan to form a coalition , the conservatives have pledged to support lopez as head of the regional government later this month or in early may .

the navy said 53-year-old captain phillips was in good health and was taken aboard the uss bainbridge , a warship that had been shadowing the lifeboat in which he was being held .
us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

us vice admiral william gortney , head of us naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing that the operation was carried out because phillips ' life was in imminent danger .
a navy commander made a split-second decision to fire on the pirates because he believed that phillips faced imminent danger amid tense hostage talks with his captors and deteriorating sea conditions .
" they were pointing the ak-47s at the captain , " vice admiral william gortney , head of the u.s. naval central command , said in a pentagon briefing from bahrain .
" the on-scene commander took it as the captain was in imminent danger and then made that decision -lrb- to kill the pirates -rrb- and he had the authorities to make that decision and he had seconds to make that decision . "
phillips was captured after pirates made an unsuccessful attempt on wednesday to hijack his ship , the maersk alabama , off the coast of somalia .

perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .

beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .

according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .

the most recent cases of alcohol abuse by minors highlight a steady and alarming increase of binge drinking by german youths . " we are observing with concern that people being brought into hospital with suspected alcohol poisoning are getting younger and younger .
even kids under the age of 15 are coming to hospitals completely drunk , " norbert klusen , ceo of the tk health insurance company , told this weekend 's edition of the frankfurter rundschau newspaper . tk statistics revealed that between 2007 and 2008 considerably more children under the age of 15 had been taken to hospital because of presumed alcohol poisoning .
if extrapolated to all children in that age group this would add up to nearly 2,400 cases of alcohol abuse . the figures for adolescents under the age of 18 were equally sobering . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when consumed in excess , alcopops can be just as harmful as other alcoholic drinks according to tk 's figures , the number of hospitalizations rose by 174 to 1,765 year-on-year .
if projected to all youths in that age bracket , this adds up to some 20,000 so-called " coma bingers . " klusen warned that supermarkets , gas stations and restaurant and pub owners had to take on more responsibility in checking the ages of their customers .
he said it was a problem " if a bottle of beer , a glass of wine and a cigarette while watching television with the family were always present . " the health expert of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , karl lauterbach , demanded in the same newspaper that alcohol sales laws be tightened .
he said that all adolescents who want to purchase alcohol be required to show proper proof of age .
lauterbach also called for stiffer penalties for retailers and restaurant owners who illegally sell alcohol to minors . jk / msh , dpa / rtr send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the lovable hare has been mighty successful at edging out jesus as the symbol of easter .
so just where did it and other easter traditions come from ? a recent study found that one in five germans had no idea what the original christian liturgical meaning of easter was .
nearly all , however , were familiar with the easter bunny .
perhaps that 's not surprising , considering the tradition 's german roots .
yes , historians believe the easter bunny made its debut among german-speakers in what is now the french-german border region between alsace and baden-württemburg .
it all started , says alois doering , an author of books on german traditions , as a way to keep kids happy .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the easter bunny has a lot of fans " the catholic kids knew that easter meant they could eat eggs again , ” says doering , referring to the prohibition of dairy products during the lenten fast .
“ but how do you explain all the egg-eating to protestant children ?

so protestants , says doering , made up a story about hares who brought baskets of eggs around to pious households .
the hare was probably chosen for the task because it had long been a symbol of fertility .

beginning in the 1400 's priests in bavaria began lightening up their sermons , inserting jokes and anecdotes , to get parishioners to laugh – as a way of making evident the joyful nature of jesus ' resurrection .
not surprisingly , this went down well , and soon priests were opening up the floor at church to garrulous members .
but such active participation by laymen and women was anathema to conservatives within the church , and two popes spoke out against easter laughter before it was banned for good in the 19th century .

according to alois doering , because of the strong association of eggs with new life , they 've been linked with easter almost from the beginning : “ originally it was the case , and in the orthodox church it still is the case , ” doering says , “ that easter eggs were painted red .
it 's the color of blood , christ 's blood , and also the color of love .
the paint was also used to separate the blessed eggs from the un-blessed ones .
and , of course , most children just ca n't resist playing with all those eggs .
they hunt down those that have been hidden ; they race them against each other in roll-offs ; one particularly popular tradition in germany has two competitors knocking eggs against each other – with high stakes : the person holding the egg that breaks has to give it to their opponent -lrb- provided their egg did n't break too -rrb- .

president obama on hopes for us economy us president barack obama has said he sees " glimmers of hope " in the economy , but warned that the system remained under " severe strain " .
speaking after a meeting with his top economic advisers , he said there was still " a lot of work to do " .
mr obama promised more action on the economy in the coming weeks .
he said he and his team had discussed the stability of the financial system , the housing market and plans to help banks clear their books of bad assets .
' a lot of hardship ' mr obama stressed his actions must translate into economic growth mr obama was speaking after a meeting at the white house with top strategists , including treasury secretary timothy geithner and federal reserve chief ben bernanke .
he told journalists afterwards : " we 're starting to see progress .
" if we stick with it , if we do n't flinch in the face of some difficulties , then i feel absolutely convinced that we are going to get this economy back on track . "
the president cited increases in loans to small businesses , tax-cut cheques going out and new investments in infrastructure and energy projects as signs of hope for the economy .
but he added a note of caution , saying that the measures taken had to " translate into economic growth and jobs and rising income for the american people . "
" and right now we 're still seeing a lot of job losses , a lot of hardship , people finding themselves in some very difficult situations , " he said .
" we still have a lot of work to do , and over the next several weeks you 'll be seeing additional actions by the administration . "
