"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.10.2009 austrians to pay tribute to firebrand joerg haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg haider 's message struck a chord with many austrians a year after his death in a car accident , austrian far-right leader joerg haider continues to captivate .
austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .

it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .

far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .

petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .

in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 11.10.2009 afghan elections hit yet another snag großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 5.6 million afghan voters cast their ballots in the poll afghanistan 's much-watched presidential elections are in for more flak after the embattled united nations special envoy admitted for the first time that there was widespread fraud in the august poll . united nations special representative kai eide told a press conference in kabul on sunday that " it is true that in a number of polling stations in the south and the southeast there was significant fraud . "
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

spanish police also discovered a further eta bomb materials cache on saturday near alicante on the eastern coast of spain .
police seized 10 kilograms of explosives after receiving a tip from a hiker .

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

of the six parties registered , all but one are pro-kremlin .
pro-western parties said that all of their candidates were barred from running for 17 directly elected seats on the council after city officials declared the signatures on their registrations invalid .
the leader of the sole party allowed to enter the race for 18 party seats said they had been blocked from advertising on television or in newspapers and even in posters on the street .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : moscow 's longtime mayor is up for re-election , amid accusations of corruption " the playing field is uneven .
we do n't have fair elections , " said sergei mitrokhin , head of the yabloko party .
according to an opinion poll by the levada center , 62 percent of muscovites say the vote is " simply an imitation of a battle " and expect council seats to be distributed by the powers that be .
" political competition is practically zero , " said liliya shibanova , head of independent poll watchdog golos .
" medvedev says we need competition , we need a multi-party system , but election results show the exact opposite . "
opposition youth groups staged a protest in moscow on saturday , attracting about 300 demonstrators .
they accused moscow mayor yuri luzhkov of inefficiency and corruption , and said city authorities have tried to suppress opposition parties .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .

he 's got an american mother .

young people are one group that is disproportionately affected by soaring unemployment , which stands at double the eurozone average .
the national rate is 18.5 percent , but among spaniards aged between 15 and 24 years old , this figure climbs as high as 37 percent , according to eurostat .
job losses are concentrated in construction and the service industry - the same sectors that once drove the country 's exponential growth .
figures from spain 's youth employment observatory show the majority of workers laid off were recruited on temporary contracts , which account for a quarter of the nation 's jobs , and half the jobs held by people under the age of 30 .
first in , first out when the global financial crisis forced spanish businesses to downsize , young employees were the first to go , leaving one in three workers under the age of 25 to face a prolonged period of unemployment .

and the financial downturn has only served to widen the gaps between the have and the have-nots in an increasingly two-tier labor market . nothing divides spain quite like the labor market .
and the effects of the current economic crisis vary according to age , geographic location and sector .
young people are one group that is disproportionately affected by soaring unemployment , which stands at double the eurozone average .
the national rate is 18.5 percent , but among spaniards aged between 15 and 24 years old , this figure climbs as high as 37 percent , according to eurostat .
job losses are concentrated in construction and the service industry - the same sectors that once drove the country 's exponential growth .
figures from spain 's youth employment observatory show the majority of workers laid off were recruited on temporary contracts , which account for a quarter of the nation 's jobs , and half the jobs held by people under the age of 30 .
first in , first out when the global financial crisis forced spanish businesses to downsize , young employees were the first to go , leaving one in three workers under the age of 25 to face a prolonged period of unemployment .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish dole queues are full of university graduates " the crisis has caused social exclusion and unemployment for young people , " confirmed alex martin from the youth branch of ugt , one of spain 's largest unions .
he said many young people are moving back home to live with their parents and are attempting go back to their studies .
martin denounced the fact that more than half of the 3.7 million spaniards out of work are under 35 .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

young people are one group that is disproportionately affected by soaring unemployment , which stands at double the eurozone average .
the national rate is 18.5 percent , but among spaniards aged between 15 and 24 years old , this figure climbs as high as 37 percent , according to eurostat .
job losses are concentrated in construction and the service industry - the same sectors that once drove the country 's exponential growth .
figures from spain 's youth employment observatory show the majority of workers laid off were recruited on temporary contracts , which account for a quarter of the nation 's jobs , and half the jobs held by people under the age of 30 .

" the challenge is not how to reform the labor market but how to reform the economy , " he said .
" we need a different kind of productive model - one with much higher capital investment , a more intensive use of technology - that is much less anchored in low-skilled professions like construction . "
in ruesga 's view , a restructured economy that creates jobs requiring higher qualifications will succeed in slowly absorb young people .

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

eu commission president josé manuel barroso , who attended saturday 's signing ceremony in warsaw , described the move as a " very important chapter for poland and the european union . "
polish president lech kaczynski said the eu was " a great experiment in the history of mankind , " which would " function even more effectively " when the treaty takes effect .
he signed the treaty only after ireland ratified it last week with an overwhelming " yes " vote in the second referendum on the subject .
the euroskeptic polish president had delayed signing the document as long as the irish vote was undecided , saying that the smaller states in the eu should n't be coerced by the larger members of the 27 nation union .
" a union of sovereign nation states " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski is concerned over giving too much power to brussels before he signed the document , president kaczynski stressed that " the european union remains a union of sovereign nation states and let it be so .

the eu , a successful experiment without precedent in human history , can not be closed to those who wish to join ... not only in the balkans but also countries like georgia . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to give the 27-nation bloc a long-term president and a stronger foreign policy chief .
it can only take effect when all member states have approved it .
poland 's signature leaves the czech republic as the sole remaining hold-out on the lisbon treaty , as its own euroskeptical president vaclav klaus awaits the outcome of a legal challenge of the treaty .
the charter of fundamental rights within the lisbon treaty , klaus says , could allow claimants " to bypass czech courts and enforce the property claims of people expelled after world war ii at the european court of justice . "

"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .

the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 11.10.2009 austrians to pay tribute to firebrand joerg haider großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : joerg haider 's message struck a chord with many austrians a year after his death in a car accident , austrian far-right leader joerg haider continues to captivate .
austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .
bad blood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's inclusion in the national government led to sanctions haider had a long history of making provocative statements , which tapped into an undercurrent of support among many austrians .
in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "
haider 's inclusion in an austrian conservative coalition government - which lasted from 2000 to 2006 - led temporarily to a number of eu countries imposing diplomatic sanctions on austria. nw / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
" it has been claimed that there was 30 percent fraud .
there is no way to know at this stage what the level of fraud is .
no one knows .
i can only say there was widespread fraud , " eide said .
eide had called the media conference to deny allegations made by his sacked former deputy , peter galbraith .
the latter had accused eide of hushing up evidence of fraud in the august 20 elections .
galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .

the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .

galbraith had previously said that 30 percent of president hamid karzai 's votes were fraudulent , echoing european union election monitors who had labeled 1.5 million votes , including 1.1 million for karzai , as being suspicious .
eide denied any interference with the process to conceal the level of fraud , saying that the un mandate in afghanistan was meant to support the process , not influence the outcome .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eide fell out with his former deputy over voter fraud accusations " the allegations made against me by my former deputy have not only been personal attacks against me and my integrity , but they have been attacks that in fact have affected the entire election process , " eide said .
the electoral complaints commission -lrb- ecc -rrb- is conducting an investigation and the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- has carried out a week-long audit of 10 percent of the suspicious ballot boxes .
election officials said on sunday that the sample audit was completed and that the results would be announced within a few days .
karzai to lose absolute majority ?
the incumbent karzai has been leading preliminary results in the afghan presidential poll with about 55 percent of the vote , followed by former foreign minister abdullah abdullah with 28 percent , according to figures released by the independent election commission -lrb- iec -rrb- last month .
should karzai , who has been bearing the brunt of fraud accusations , drop below 50 percent , he would have to face a run-off with abdullah abdullah .
iec officials have said that a run-off would have to be held three weeks after final results are announced and before winter weather makes rural areas in central and northern afghanistan inaccessible. nk / ap / afp / dpa / reuters editor : holly fox send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .
bad blood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's inclusion in the national government led to sanctions haider had a long history of making provocative statements , which tapped into an undercurrent of support among many austrians .
in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .
bad blood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's inclusion in the national government led to sanctions haider had a long history of making provocative statements , which tapped into an undercurrent of support among many austrians .
in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "
haider 's inclusion in an austrian conservative coalition government - which lasted from 2000 to 2006 - led temporarily to a number of eu countries imposing diplomatic sanctions on austria. nw / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

eu commission president josé manuel barroso , who attended saturday 's signing ceremony in warsaw , described the move as a " very important chapter for poland and the european union . "
polish president lech kaczynski said the eu was " a great experiment in the history of mankind , " which would " function even more effectively " when the treaty takes effect .
he signed the treaty only after ireland ratified it last week with an overwhelming " yes " vote in the second referendum on the subject .

the lisbon treaty is designed to give the 27-nation bloc a long-term president and a stronger foreign policy chief .
it can only take effect when all member states have approved it .
poland 's signature leaves the czech republic as the sole remaining hold-out on the lisbon treaty , as its own euroskeptical president vaclav klaus awaits the outcome of a legal challenge of the treaty .
the charter of fundamental rights within the lisbon treaty , klaus says , could allow claimants " to bypass czech courts and enforce the property claims of people expelled after world war ii at the european court of justice . "

eu commission president josé manuel barroso , who attended saturday 's signing ceremony in warsaw , described the move as a " very important chapter for poland and the european union . "
polish president lech kaczynski said the eu was " a great experiment in the history of mankind , " which would " function even more effectively " when the treaty takes effect .
he signed the treaty only after ireland ratified it last week with an overwhelming " yes " vote in the second referendum on the subject .
the euroskeptic polish president had delayed signing the document as long as the irish vote was undecided , saying that the smaller states in the eu should n't be coerced by the larger members of the 27 nation union .
" a union of sovereign nation states " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kaczynski is concerned over giving too much power to brussels before he signed the document , president kaczynski stressed that " the european union remains a union of sovereign nation states and let it be so . "
" we now have 27 member states .
i am deeply convinced this is not the end ...
the eu , a successful experiment without precedent in human history , can not be closed to those who wish to join ... not only in the balkans but also countries like georgia . "
the lisbon treaty is designed to give the 27-nation bloc a long-term president and a stronger foreign policy chief .
it can only take effect when all member states have approved it .
poland 's signature leaves the czech republic as the sole remaining hold-out on the lisbon treaty , as its own euroskeptical president vaclav klaus awaits the outcome of a legal challenge of the treaty .
the charter of fundamental rights within the lisbon treaty , klaus says , could allow claimants " to bypass czech courts and enforce the property claims of people expelled after world war ii at the european court of justice . "
any further delay would be disappointing to barroso who hoped to see the treaty take effect by january 1 , 2010. sjt / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the kingmaker greens chose this coalition over a more left-leaning grouping . at a party meeting in saarlouis on sunday , party members voted 117 to 32 to move forward with a coalition with the center-right christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- and the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- .
earlier , the head of the saarland greens , hubert ulrich , indicated his preference for the conservative coalition . this move by the greens will keep the cdu 's peter mueller in power as state premier even though his party lost its absolute majority on august 30 .
the left party , which partly is rooted in the former communist part of east germany , did particularly well in the state of saarland , and together with the spd had the same number of seats as the the cdu and fdp .
that gave the greens , with just 5.9 percent of the vote , the chance to determine the state 's next leader .
but coalition negotiations were rocked on friday when oskar lafontaine , national chairman of the left party , announced he was giving up his post as leader as well as his seat in the bundestag , the german parliament .
lafontaine indicated he would be interested in becoming more involved in saarland if his party were to end up part of the ruling coalition there .
but during the greens meeting in saarland , ulrich made it clear that lafontaine 's move further cemented his disinterest in working with the left part .
" i do n't trust this man or this party at all , " said ulrich .
ulrich also said a coalition with conservative parties would mean the greens would not always be expected to join left-leaning coalitions .
should the greens eventually form a government with the center-right cdu and fdp , the new saarland government could set a precedent for national politics .
with an increasing number of smaller parties in the german parliament , future collations are likely to depend on more cooperation between parties that traditionally would seem rather at odds with each other. hf / afp / ap / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .

winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .

his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .

now , mesut oezil has proven himself as one of the big boys on germany 's national team . the german national team can breathe a little easier after their win against russia secured their spot in the 2010 world cup in south africa .
one goal from miroslav klose was all it took , but it was mesut oezil who got the ball to klose 's foot .
after fielding a pass from lukas podolski , oezil approached the goal from the left and drew the keeper out .
he faked a shot , which the keeper fell to the ground to block .
with the keeper out of the picture , oezil quickly snapped a pass to klose in front of the goal who completed the play for the score .
it was oezil 's fourth match for the german national team , and there is a good possibility he ’ ll be a part of the team that travels to south africa for the world cup .
if that ’ s the case , a man named andreas winkler from oezil ’ s youth will be just one of many germans watching with admiration .
dreaming of schalke andreas winkler is the youth coordinator for rot-weiss essen , a soccer club in the ruhrgebiet .
he recalls a shy , skinny kid with a technically sound game , lots of speed , and a mean left foot who came to rot-weiss essen 's youth program at age 12 .
that same kid had always wanted to play for the youth teams of bundesliga side schalke , but according to winkler , the coaches there saw a problem with the young mesut oezil .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oezil in the royal blue of his hometown team schalke 04 " mesut tried to go to schalke , but they said he is too small , too skinny , " winkler told deutsche welle .
" but we were happy to get him . "
according to winkler , oezil was a player who simply loved to play soccer , and he did n't let comments about his size stop him from enjoying the game and improving his skills .
winkler says oezil was the type of player whose thoughts never drifted far from the pitch .
" you could call him at five in the morning and say to him , ' hey , let 's play football , " ' winkler said .
cracking the bundesliga oezil left rot-weiss essen in 2005 and made it to the junior squad of schalke in his hometown of gelsenkirchen .
any qualms from schalke about his size were forgotten , and he made the jump to schalke 's bundesliga roster in 2007 , playing in some of the team 's champions league matches .
the move to the bundesliga squad was well-deserved for oezil , but he did n't see consistent playing time at schalke .
in january 2008 , oezil transferred to his current side werder bremen , where he has seen plenty of action .
last season , with oezil 's help , bremen made it to the final of the uefa cup and the final of the german cup against leverkusen .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with one swipe of his left foot , oezil brought the german cup to bremen there , in berlin 's olympic stadium , oezil put the cap on his best season in the bundesliga .
in the 57th minute , oezil sprinted from midfield and took a pass on the run .
he got the pass under control , wound up his left foot and fired the winning goal for bremen in the german cup , which marked the end of a breakout year for the 21-year-old .
" i 'm very satisfied with the past bundesliga season , " oezil wrote in a post to his website after the german cup .
" for me it was very important to find some consistency in my abilities .
and to put the season away by holding the german cup in my hands - that was really a one-of-a-kind feeling . "
suiting up for germany less than a month after the win with bremen in the german cup , oezil was back on the big stage , wearing the jersey of the german under-21 national team at the european championship in sweden .
germany went undefeated on their way to its first u21 european championship , and oezil played a critical role .
of the eight goals scored by germany in its five matches , oezil contributed the assist on four .
he also added a goal for himself in the final against england - a free kick from a stunning 35 meters - and earned ' man of the match ' honors .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a long free kick from oezil helped germany beat england the match against russia was oezil 's second world cup qualification game .
in addition to his assist on klose 's goal , oezil was inches away from his second national team goal when a long strike bounced off the crossbar .
his first goal for the national team in a friendly against south africa .
joachim loew , coach of the german national team , says oezil brings lots of creativity and creates dangerous situations from his position in the midfield – skills loew will need when he leads the team to south africa .
the coach can also be thankful oezil didn ’ t end up playing for another squad .
oezil 's success in germany caught the attention of officials with the turkish national team .
oezil grew up with dual turkish-german citizenship , meaning he could theoretically play for the turkish national team .
but he put an end to the tug-of-war between the two nations by announcing in february 2009 that he was 100 percent committed to the german national team .
bildunterschrift : the youth coordinator at oezil 's former team says the young man is always ready to play soccer a promising season in the making with germany 's world cup qualification secure , oezil can now focus his attention on the bundesliga , where werder bremen are currently in fourth place .
they have also reached the round of 16 in the german cup and lead their group in the group stage of the europa league .
after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .
bad blood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's inclusion in the national government led to sanctions haider had a long history of making provocative statements , which tapped into an undercurrent of support among many austrians .
in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "

after the departure of werder 's star midfielder diego , oezil has moved into a more prominent role on the attack with the team 's two strikers .
in a post to his website earlier in the week , oezil said that the move suits him .
" i 'm glad that i can work so well with claudio pizarro and marko marin , " he said .
" at the moment things are going really well at werder . "
with over eight months to go until the start of the world cup , and a full program ahead of him with werder bremen , it 's too early to predict exactly how oezil will factor into the german national squad in 2010 .
but the scrappy young player from gelsenkirchen only seems to get better and better , indicating a good chance we 'll hear more from him - and his strong left foot - next summer in south africa .

austrians have turned out in large numbers on sunday to pay their respects to the divisive politician . joerg haider 's supporters have held a number of ceremonies across austria on sunday , to honor the controversial figure a year after his death in a car accident .
special events included a mass at klagenfurt cathedral and the inauguration of a road-side monument at the site of his accident , which has already become a destination for pilgrims seeking to pay tribute to the former far-right leader .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crash site quickly became a place of pilgrimage for haider supporters on friday , a special exhibit dedicated to haider was opened at a museum which will eventually be devoted entirely to the divisive figure .
its organisers say it focuses more on haider 's personality than his politics .
it features childhood toys and some of his stylish clothes , praises him as " disciplined " and " human , " and avoids the more controversial themes of his life , such as his admiration for some aspects of nazi rule .
off the rails joerg haider died in a car accident on october 11 last year .
he was 58 at the time , married , a father of two daughters and governor of carinthia .
investigators found that he had three times the legal limit of alcohol in his blood when he lost control of his vehicle on a road near klagenfurt in the early hours of the morning .
he had been returning from a party at a gay bar and was travelling at around 140 kilometres per hour , or roughly twice the local speed limit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider was found to be heavily intoxicated at the time of the crash those circumstances did nothing to dent haider 's popularity , and conspiracy theories of the crash abound in his home province .
one year on from his death , his alliance for the future of austria party enjoys unprecedented levels of support in carinthia .
earlier this year it won regional elections with 45 percent of the vote .
however , it has disappeared from other provincial parliaments and may be losing ground to its main rival for the far-right vote across the rest of the country .
far right gains haider 's alliance for the future of austria party emerged in 2005 when its founders split from the freedom party , which haider led throughout the 1990s .
austria 's two far-right parties won roughly 27 percent of the vote between them at last year 's legislative elections .
together , they now control 54 of the 183 seats in the country 's national parliament and form the biggest opposition to the ruling coalition of social democrats and the centre-right people 's party .
as well as campaigning against accepting immigrants , the far right parties oppose turkey 's membership of the european union and reject eu influence in austrian affairs .
the alliance for the future of austria is now led by josef bucher , after a brief stint by the man believed to be haider 's former lover , stefan petzner .
petzner suggested he had a homosexual relationship with haider at a press conference shortly after the man 's death last year . the freedom party is currently led by heinz-christian strache , who has been more successful than the alliance in emulating his former rival 's appeal to younger voters and use of anti-immigrant slogans .
bad blood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : haider 's inclusion in the national government led to sanctions haider had a long history of making provocative statements , which tapped into an undercurrent of support among many austrians .
in 1991 he was forced to stand down as governor of carinthia - a post he later reclaimed - after saying the nazis had a " proper employment policy . "
on another occasion in 2005 he triggered international outrage when he paid tribute to the waffen ss , telling a gathering of axis war veterans that the nazi military force had been a group " of honest citizens " who stayed " true to their convictions . "
haider 's inclusion in an austrian conservative coalition government - which lasted from 2000 to 2006 - led temporarily to a number of eu countries imposing diplomatic sanctions on austria. nw / afp / dpa editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

voting george papandreou 's socialist party into power , greece resoundingly voted for change .
dw athens correspondent malcolm brabant sent this postcard with his ironic take on papandreou 's biggest challenge - corruption . greece 's new socialist prime minister , george papandreou , did something very alarming on the day his cabinet was sworn into office .
for the first time ever , the cabinet meeting was held in public , live on television .
how very un-greek .
it was like some horror movie out of sweden , where papandreou received part of his education .
this is n't the way we do things in this country .
we deliberate in private , then tell the greek people what we are going to do .
and they can like or lump it .
what is all this public accountability nonsense ? in greece , we pay people to vote for us , either with real bribes or with the prospect of a job for life . everyone knows what the score is .
we give your talentless son stavros a civil service post in the ministry of public works , where he can drink coffee all day , obstruct the public and go home at two o 'clock in the afternoon .
the salary is n't great , but he 'll have an index-linked pension .
another major perk is that every now and again , when a citizen is about to throw themself off the acropolis in frustration , stavros will be able to demand an envelope full of high denomination notes just to cut through the ministry 's red tape .
in return for this small favor , we do exactly what we like once we are in office .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : athens correspondent malcolm brabant unfortunately , the old ministry of works , always a nice little earner , is history .
papandreou has streamlined the government and created some new ministries with very politically correct titles .
for example , there 's the ministry of environment , energy and climate change , which is right at the core of the prime minster 's vision of creating a green economy . i suppose the countryside is now going to be swarming with forest rangers stopping people from dumping their rubbish in the woods .
how are you supposed to keep your car clean , if you ca n't toss your cigarette packet out of the window ?
this is just a knee-jerk reaction to a few little fires . furthermore , this new ministry is planning to create electricity out of greece 's sun , wind and dormant volcanoes .
where 's the money in that ?
what 's wrong with good old lignite , or brown coal , which greece also has in abundance ?
nice handsome contracts to be had from all the mining equipment and then filling in the open cast pits afterwards . this papandreou is dangerous .
he 's threatening to destroy the status quo .
amazing when you consider he 's part of a political dynasty .
how are his children going to get on in the world if you get rid of nepotism and patronage ?
but what can you expect ?
papandreou is not a proper greek .
he was n't even born here .
he was born in the united states .
he 's got an american mother .
he 's probably an agent for the cia .
yes , of course he is .
that 's it .
anyway back to that cabinet meeting .
do you know what papandreou did ?
he invited the country 's ombudsman to give a pep talk to the new ministers .
for those of you who do n't know our country very well , the ombudsman is greece 's mr clean and unimpeachable .
he does things like carry out investigations into how policemen shoot 15-year-old schoolboys .
he tells the authorities not to be trigger happy in the future .
we go , " yes , of course , you 're absolutely right , " and then totally ignore him and his recommendations .
well , this ombudsman fellow had the audacity to tell the cabinet how important it is to be transparent and how corruption undermines the public 's faith .
what 's more , papandreou chips in and says every euro has to be accounted for .
well that 's no fun is it ?
if he 's true to his word , there 'll be no more european funds spent on motorway bridges that end up in a sheer cliff and go nowhere .
or on subsidizing olive plantations that are a figment of the imagination .
how 's a politician supposed to survive ?
it 's our right to build luxury villas in protected forests .
what 's wrong with asking for the odd million for handing out ferry routes to the islands ? did n't papandreou learn anything from his old man andreas ?
what a great prime minister andreas papandreou was .
he survived a real corruption scandal .
when he was about 300 hundred years old , he had a 30-year-old mistress who was a buxom air hostess .
every time andreas was about to die from heart disease , the air hostess turned up and he got a new lease on life .
those were the days .
a politician could start off with a donkey for transport and end up with a top of the range mercedes .
papandreou seems to have got rid of his dad 's old chums .
no loyalty nowadays .
why ca n't george be more like his father ?
mind you , the people i feel really sorry for are the journalists .
if george turns greece into sweden , it 'll be so boring , there 'll be nothing to write about .

the former senior investigator said the rmp was not equipped to deal with the pressures of their own investigations .
he told bbc 5 live 's donal macintyre programme allegations of torture and murder were being " covered up " .
the ministry of defence said there was no evidence of failures and claims of abuse were always fully investigated .

he said a lack of resources was partly to blame , but claimed there were also serious structural flaws in the army justice system .
one case which came to his attention involved the alleged murder of an iraqi by a british sergeant .
there was , he claimed , evidence to strongly suggest the iraqi victim had been shot at point blank range for throwing rocks at a british army tank .
' testing conditions ' he told the bbc : " a friend of mine who was a senior nco went to the scene and was ordered not to investigate it as a murder .
he was told that statements should just be taken as if it was a routine incident . "
some cases involving allegations of murder and abuse , followed by a failure to carry out an adequate investigation , have already come to public attention .
the death of baha mousa , an iraqi hotel receptionist who died in british military custody having allegedly been beaten by soldiers , is currently the subject of a public inquiry .

it also said there was no evidence of systemic failure or interference in the rmp or military justice system .
in a statement it added : " we must remember that over 100,000 of our personnel served in iraq and , with the exception of a few individuals , they have performed to the highest standards under extraordinarily testing conditions there . "
