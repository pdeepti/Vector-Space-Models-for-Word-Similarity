" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .
" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .
gorbachev 's reform agenda in the soviet union in the 1980s was crucial for the eventual collapse of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- regime , and paved the way for the swift reunification of germany that followed. nw / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

conservatives likely to lose the greek electorate will vote on sunday in a snap election in which the incumbent conservatives , who have struggled to cope with the economic crisis and social discontent , are expected to lose to the opposition socialists .
opinion polls suggest the greek socialist pasok party of giorgos papandreou will win , ending the rule of the karamanlis ' new democracy party after five and a half years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou , left and karamanlis karamanlis called an early election at the beginning of september , after several scandals and a deteriorating economic situation made his position untenable .
but it remains unclear whether the socialists would win an absolute majority in the 300-seat parliament and end up governing alone .
both karamanlis and papandreou have pledged to pull greece out of the economic crisis and root out corruption .
greece is in a serious economic crisis : the budget deficit is estimated to be twice the permitted eu ceiling of three percent and public debt is expected to exceed 100 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2009 .
on top of this , the financial crisis is likely to affect vital tourism revenues and unemployment is rising for the first time in years. bk / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .

the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .

her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .

prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 03.10.2009 ireland says " yes " to eu treaty in key vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time around , irish voters gave the thumbs-up to the treaty irish officials said saturday voters had strongly approved the eu 's lisbon treaty in a crucial second referendum , averting a major crisis and allowing the bloc to reform and gain more global clout . " i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .
" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .
gorbachev 's reform agenda in the soviet union in the 1980s was crucial for the eventual collapse of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- regime , and paved the way for the swift reunification of germany that followed. nw / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

one of those is the existence of an entirely independent development ministry , which outgoing social democrat development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul once said was the envy of many nations . most industrialized countries incorporate the development portfolio into their foreign ministries , which – if the fdp has its way – is the path that germany will also take .

" if you just attach development aid to the foreign ministry , as has been done in other countries , it 's bound to only play a marginal role , " hoppe said . the introduction of the first independent development ministry in 1961 was championed by walter scheel , a leading member of the free democrats , who was later elected as the federal president of the former west germany .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”

no one was hurt in the attack which took place ahead of sunday 's election . the terrorist group , calling itself conspiracy of fire nuclei , posted a message online saying that the bomb was intended to " send a message " to greek authorities .
the statement said the group had infiltrated crowds of supporters of the prime minister 's new democracy party headed for the rally , a " stupid mass reminiscent of a zombie movie , " and had placed the bomb and slipped away without being spotted by the handful of police stationed nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has suffered social unrest following the financial crisis the blast shattered windows at neighboring shops and caused minor damage to nearby motorbikes but the rally went ahead without further incident .
the terrorist group also claimed responsibility for another home-made bomb which exploded outside the home of a senior opposition socialist last week .
greek police arrested four suspected members of the group after that attack , though the online statement claimed that those arrested were not members of the group .
greece has suffered a spate of minor bombings by various political groups in recent weeks as civil unrest grows .
conservatives likely to lose the greek electorate will vote on sunday in a snap election in which the incumbent conservatives , who have struggled to cope with the economic crisis and social discontent , are expected to lose to the opposition socialists .
opinion polls suggest the greek socialist pasok party of giorgos papandreou will win , ending the rule of the karamanlis ' new democracy party after five and a half years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou , left and karamanlis karamanlis called an early election at the beginning of september , after several scandals and a deteriorating economic situation made his position untenable .
but it remains unclear whether the socialists would win an absolute majority in the 300-seat parliament and end up governing alone .
both karamanlis and papandreou have pledged to pull greece out of the economic crisis and root out corruption .
greece is in a serious economic crisis : the budget deficit is estimated to be twice the permitted eu ceiling of three percent and public debt is expected to exceed 100 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2009 .

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .

" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .

" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .

five volunteers from the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- - germany 's disaster relief organization - have also signed up .
officials said virtually nothing remained saturday of four villages on a hillside on the padang pariman district in west sumatra . media reports say a lack electricity , fuel shortages and telecommunication outages were complicating the relief operations . since the earthquake struck on wednesday , rescuers have been scrambling to recover any survivors and prevent the spread of disease , as witnesses report a strong stench of decomposing bodies , which are lying in the rubble of collapsed buildings .
entire villages have been destroyed and as many as 4,000 people are believed to be trapped .
hope of finding survivors " i think there could still be survivors , " yoshiaki shimazu , the leader of a specialist team from japan told afp .
" the way the building fell , there could be voids . "
bildunterschrift : aid workers believe there could still be survivors trapped in the quake rubble according to the united nations , at least 1,100 people have died in the quake that struck sumatra 's west coast , northwest of padang on wednesday . the indonesian government has so far reported 777 deaths , but says it expects the final death toll to be much higher .
experts said that with specialized crews now arriving , there was some chance of continuing to find survivors so long as their injuries were not too serious .
in addition to germany , countries supplying rescue teams include japan , australia , switzerland , south korea , and singapore .
other nations have sent money , medicine , tents and food to meet indonesia 's call for foreign aid .

" i am delighted for the country .

he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .

prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .

dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five volunteers from the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- - germany 's disaster relief organization - have also signed up .
officials said virtually nothing remained saturday of four villages on a hillside on the padang pariman district in west sumatra . media reports say a lack electricity , fuel shortages and telecommunication outages were complicating the relief operations . since the earthquake struck on wednesday , rescuers have been scrambling to recover any survivors and prevent the spread of disease , as witnesses report a strong stench of decomposing bodies , which are lying in the rubble of collapsed buildings .
entire villages have been destroyed and as many as 4,000 people are believed to be trapped .
hope of finding survivors " i think there could still be survivors , " yoshiaki shimazu , the leader of a specialist team from japan told afp .

other nations have sent money , medicine , tents and food to meet indonesia 's call for foreign aid .
the european commission said in a statement that it had donated 3 million euros to help deal with initial humanitarian needs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 03.10.2009 ireland says " yes " to eu treaty in key vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time around , irish voters gave the thumbs-up to the treaty irish officials said saturday voters had strongly approved the eu 's lisbon treaty in a crucial second referendum , averting a major crisis and allowing the bloc to reform and gain more global clout . " i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .
" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .
gorbachev 's reform agenda in the soviet union in the 1980s was crucial for the eventual collapse of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- regime , and paved the way for the swift reunification of germany that followed. nw / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : what life was like in communist east germany katarina witt , socialism 's most beautiful face east german stasi tried to recruit merkel as a spy typically ossi - typically wessi demolished treasures from east germany eastern germany -pipe- 03.10.2009 east german brands thrive 20 years after end of communism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true or not , east german goods had a bad reputation for quality and styling east german goods had a reputation for shoddy quality and gruesome styling , even if that was n't always the case .
twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 03.10.2009 europe unprepared to cope with migration , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to refugees who died on their journey on the italian island of lampedusa german aid workers are on trial in sicily for rescuing african refugees after their boat sank in the mediterranean five years ago .
the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those is the existence of an entirely independent development ministry , which outgoing social democrat development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul once said was the envy of many nations . most industrialized countries incorporate the development portfolio into their foreign ministries , which – if the fdp has its way – is the path that germany will also take .
that would leave party leader guido westerwelle , expected to take over as foreign minister , in charge of development aid . the fdp 's view could prove to be a point of contention in coalition talks with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who do not support the abolition of the development ministry . claudia warning , the head of venro , an umbrella organization for development aid groups , says a strong ministry will ensure that aid commitments are adhered to , despite a strained budget in the wake of the global financial crisis . " after all , the rich industrialized nations caused the current crisis , " warning said .
" the poorer countries must not be punished for it by less development aid coming their way in the future . " no aid for china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is expected to take over the foreign ministry westerwelle wants germany to stop sending aid to rapidly industrializing nations , such as china , india and brazil , saying it makes no sense to send millions of euros to such countries while the government is unable to balance the budget at home . this stance has the german green party up in arms .
greens lawmaker thilo hoppe told deutsche welle that only a separate ministry would be capable of dealing with the challenges ahead . " if you just attach development aid to the foreign ministry , as has been done in other countries , it 's bound to only play a marginal role , " hoppe said . the introduction of the first independent development ministry in 1961 was championed by walter scheel , a leading member of the free democrats , who was later elected as the federal president of the former west germany .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .
" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .
gorbachev 's reform agenda in the soviet union in the 1980s was crucial for the eventual collapse of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- regime , and paved the way for the swift reunification of germany that followed. nw / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .

but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .

the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .

under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : dossier : what life was like in communist east germany katarina witt , socialism 's most beautiful face east german stasi tried to recruit merkel as a spy typically ossi - typically wessi demolished treasures from east germany eastern germany -pipe- 03.10.2009 east german brands thrive 20 years after end of communism großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : true or not , east german goods had a bad reputation for quality and styling east german goods had a reputation for shoddy quality and gruesome styling , even if that was n't always the case .
twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 03.10.2009 europe unprepared to cope with migration , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to refugees who died on their journey on the italian island of lampedusa german aid workers are on trial in sicily for rescuing african refugees after their boat sank in the mediterranean five years ago .
the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .

unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .

dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .

" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .

" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .
gorbachev 's reform agenda in the soviet union in the 1980s was crucial for the eventual collapse of the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- regime , and paved the way for the swift reunification of germany that followed. nw / ap / dpa editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one was hurt in the attack which took place ahead of sunday 's election . the terrorist group , calling itself conspiracy of fire nuclei , posted a message online saying that the bomb was intended to " send a message " to greek authorities .

funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five volunteers from the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- - germany 's disaster relief organization - have also signed up .
officials said virtually nothing remained saturday of four villages on a hillside on the padang pariman district in west sumatra . media reports say a lack electricity , fuel shortages and telecommunication outages were complicating the relief operations . since the earthquake struck on wednesday , rescuers have been scrambling to recover any survivors and prevent the spread of disease , as witnesses report a strong stench of decomposing bodies , which are lying in the rubble of collapsed buildings .
entire villages have been destroyed and as many as 4,000 people are believed to be trapped .
hope of finding survivors " i think there could still be survivors , " yoshiaki shimazu , the leader of a specialist team from japan told afp .

bildunterschrift : aid workers believe there could still be survivors trapped in the quake rubble according to the united nations , at least 1,100 people have died in the quake that struck sumatra 's west coast , northwest of padang on wednesday . the indonesian government has so far reported 777 deaths , but says it expects the final death toll to be much higher .
experts said that with specialized crews now arriving , there was some chance of continuing to find survivors so long as their injuries were not too serious .
in addition to germany , countries supplying rescue teams include japan , australia , switzerland , south korea , and singapore .
other nations have sent money , medicine , tents and food to meet indonesia 's call for foreign aid .
the european commission said in a statement that it had donated 3 million euros to help deal with initial humanitarian needs .
geologists have long warned that the low-lying city of padang risks being wiped out by a tsunami if an earthquake of a similar magnitude that caused the 2004 tsunami were to hit .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security is tighter amid fears of a terrorist attack international tribute former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev said germans could be proud of their reunification .
" germans have every reason to celebrate this event , they have achieved a lot in the reconstruction of their country , " he told tabloid bild am sonntag .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .

" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .

security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .

funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "

" we should n't expect any miracles .

funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this week on planet blog we talk to the creator of a game that teaches young adults to make smart decisions about that data . no demographic has embraced web-based social media as completely as teenagers , but , in many respects , no one is as vulnerable to online predation as teens .
the online game smokescreen aims to teach them to protect themselves .
adrian hon , co-founder of the entertainment production company six to start , said one of the challenges in making smokescreen was persuading teens that they did n't already know everything about the internet . he said the game is n't about portraying the internet as brimming over with pedophiles , rather it 's about educating users of social media to be careful about what information they share and how to interact with others online . send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

five volunteers from the technisches hilfswerk -lrb- thw -rrb- - germany 's disaster relief organization - have also signed up .
officials said virtually nothing remained saturday of four villages on a hillside on the padang pariman district in west sumatra . media reports say a lack electricity , fuel shortages and telecommunication outages were complicating the relief operations . since the earthquake struck on wednesday , rescuers have been scrambling to recover any survivors and prevent the spread of disease , as witnesses report a strong stench of decomposing bodies , which are lying in the rubble of collapsed buildings .
entire villages have been destroyed and as many as 4,000 people are believed to be trapped .
hope of finding survivors " i think there could still be survivors , " yoshiaki shimazu , the leader of a specialist team from japan told afp .
" the way the building fell , there could be voids . "
bildunterschrift : aid workers believe there could still be survivors trapped in the quake rubble according to the united nations , at least 1,100 people have died in the quake that struck sumatra 's west coast , northwest of padang on wednesday . the indonesian government has so far reported 777 deaths , but says it expects the final death toll to be much higher .
experts said that with specialized crews now arriving , there was some chance of continuing to find survivors so long as their injuries were not too serious .
in addition to germany , countries supplying rescue teams include japan , australia , switzerland , south korea , and singapore .
other nations have sent money , medicine , tents and food to meet indonesia 's call for foreign aid .
the european commission said in a statement that it had donated 3 million euros to help deal with initial humanitarian needs .
geologists have long warned that the low-lying city of padang risks being wiped out by a tsunami if an earthquake of a similar magnitude that caused the 2004 tsunami were to hit .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .

prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .

" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .

funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .

security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one was hurt in the attack which took place ahead of sunday 's election . the terrorist group , calling itself conspiracy of fire nuclei , posted a message online saying that the bomb was intended to " send a message " to greek authorities .
the statement said the group had infiltrated crowds of supporters of the prime minister 's new democracy party headed for the rally , a " stupid mass reminiscent of a zombie movie , " and had placed the bomb and slipped away without being spotted by the handful of police stationed nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has suffered social unrest following the financial crisis the blast shattered windows at neighboring shops and caused minor damage to nearby motorbikes but the rally went ahead without further incident .
the terrorist group also claimed responsibility for another home-made bomb which exploded outside the home of a senior opposition socialist last week .
greek police arrested four suspected members of the group after that attack , though the online statement claimed that those arrested were not members of the group .
greece has suffered a spate of minor bombings by various political groups in recent weeks as civil unrest grows .
conservatives likely to lose the greek electorate will vote on sunday in a snap election in which the incumbent conservatives , who have struggled to cope with the economic crisis and social discontent , are expected to lose to the opposition socialists .
opinion polls suggest the greek socialist pasok party of giorgos papandreou will win , ending the rule of the karamanlis ' new democracy party after five and a half years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou , left and karamanlis karamanlis called an early election at the beginning of september , after several scandals and a deteriorating economic situation made his position untenable .
but it remains unclear whether the socialists would win an absolute majority in the 300-seat parliament and end up governing alone .
both karamanlis and papandreou have pledged to pull greece out of the economic crisis and root out corruption .

" i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .

german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .

prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .

the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .

under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 03.10.2009 europe unprepared to cope with migration , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to refugees who died on their journey on the italian island of lampedusa german aid workers are on trial in sicily for rescuing african refugees after their boat sank in the mediterranean five years ago .
the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .

its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bionade now plans to take its taste worldwide . at a press conference friday in hamburg , bionade founder and ceo peter kowalsky announced that radeberger would take 70 percent stake in the company , enlarging a smaller stake it already held and buying out the carbonated water company schindel group 's 51 percent share .
the organic soda was first introduced onto the market in 1997 and has built up a cult following across germany with flavors such as ginger-orange and elderberries .
kowalsky and his brother stephen will hold onto the remainder of the company and continue to run bionade 's operations from the family brewery in bavaria where they founded the firm .
kowalsky was sweet on the sour soda 's future with radeberger .
" we do n't want bionade to remain some kind of trendy soda in germany , " kowlasky told reporters .
first , germany .
next , the world .
under its new ownership , bionade plans to expand internationally , first in other german-speaking countries and then further afield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bionade is the world 's first nonalcoholic drink made by fermentation the radeberger group owns various breweries around germany including radeberger , berliner kindl , jever and clausthaler .
its parent company , oetker , is one of germany 's largest conglomerates with over 9 billion euros in 2008 revenue .
the company 's range of products spans from baking soda to frozen pizza to shipping and insurance .
although oetker is based in bielefeld , bionade will hold onto its bavarian headquarters in the town of ostheim .
under the control of the schindel group since 2004 , bionade has surged onto the german market and is one of the four most popular german soft drink brands .
but schindel sold bionade because the company 's plans to expand abroad would put it in competition with soda giants like coca-cola and carlsberg and schindel was too small to compete , said kowalsky .
the company does not expect immediate success on foreign markets , despite positive test marketing across europe , and is planning a five-year international expansion strategy .
last year , bionade sold 150 million bottles of its organic sodas , generating 40 million euros in sales and employing about 170 workers .
a price increase this year led to a 20 to 25 percent fall in sales , kowalsky said , though he expected revenues to remain stable. bn / ap / dpa / afp / reuters editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those is the existence of an entirely independent development ministry , which outgoing social democrat development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul once said was the envy of many nations . most industrialized countries incorporate the development portfolio into their foreign ministries , which – if the fdp has its way – is the path that germany will also take .
that would leave party leader guido westerwelle , expected to take over as foreign minister , in charge of development aid . the fdp 's view could prove to be a point of contention in coalition talks with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who do not support the abolition of the development ministry . claudia warning , the head of venro , an umbrella organization for development aid groups , says a strong ministry will ensure that aid commitments are adhered to , despite a strained budget in the wake of the global financial crisis . " after all , the rich industrialized nations caused the current crisis , " warning said .
" the poorer countries must not be punished for it by less development aid coming their way in the future . " no aid for china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is expected to take over the foreign ministry westerwelle wants germany to stop sending aid to rapidly industrializing nations , such as china , india and brazil , saying it makes no sense to send millions of euros to such countries while the government is unable to balance the budget at home . this stance has the german green party up in arms .
greens lawmaker thilo hoppe told deutsche welle that only a separate ministry would be capable of dealing with the challenges ahead . " if you just attach development aid to the foreign ministry , as has been done in other countries , it 's bound to only play a marginal role , " hoppe said . the introduction of the first independent development ministry in 1961 was championed by walter scheel , a leading member of the free democrats , who was later elected as the federal president of the former west germany .

october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .
communist footwear goes high-end another company that successfully tried that tactic is zeha , a shoe company that was once the adidas of east germany .
founded in 1897 in thuringia , it become the only sport shoe maker in east germany after world war two and supplied most of the country 's sports teams and also the soviet national soccer team but after reunification , zeha foundered .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .
prices start around 100 euros and climb much higher .
although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .
" i always had a pair , and it was forbidden to wear them in your spare time because it was difficult to get a pair , but we did anyway because it was cool , " heine told deutsche welle .
the brand has taken off in fashion circles and hip shoe stores worldwide stock zehas , including boutiques in new york and tokyo .
but perhaps zeha 's biggest coup came at the end of july when it opened its newest store in berlin .
the store sits on the ku 'damm , west berlin 's most famous shopping street and throughout the cold war and the division of the city and the country it served as a showcase for unbridled consumption .
twenty years after the fall of the berlin wall , an east german brand is being treated as a luxury item .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : due to a shortage of cotton , many east german fashions were made with polyester " all the people were keen to wear western brands , adidas and nike , and on the other hand they lost their sport market as well , so all of a sudden they lost everything they had and needed to close down , " said torsten heine , who , along with a friend , bought the rights to the name and re-founded the brand a few years ago .
the shoes are modeled on old zeha models , including soccer boots and track shoes and combine retro design with high quality materials , such as hand-stitched italian leather .

although zehas are no longer a shoe for the masses - or for athletes - heine says that 's beside the point , the brand captures the mystique of the era .

twenty years after the collapse of the communist regime , east german brands are once again thriving . to see what life was like as a consumer in the former east germany , the best place to start is at a museum .
at the ddr museum in the center of berlin , stefan wolle points to a cabinet filled with packages of coffee and sugar covered with simple labeling .
" we did n't have marketing , " wolle , who serves as chief historian for the museum , said .
" but the quality was generally better than people said later -lsb- after reunification -rsb- . "
in the years immediately following german reunification in 1990 , over 14,000 east german companies were privatized and as many as four million east german workers lost their jobs .
even companies that made well-respected products were swallowed up by the tide of western goods that soon flooded into what are now known as the " new federal states " in eastern germany .
" the good items from quality east german brands sat on the shelves and were n't sold , " nils busch-petersen , the head of berlin 's retail association said .
" people 's consumer preferences changed literally overnight . "
polyester and trabants bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the trabant came to symbolize life for consumers in east germany : scarce and small east germans , who had long had access to west german television and could see , but not sample , western consumer goods , associated those products with a standard of living that had been denied to them behind the berlin wall .
there were plenty of products that consumers had good reason to shun , from the cramped , exhaust-spewing trabant cars east germans had to wait a dozen or more years to buy or the polyester clothes that were a staple of east german fashion due to a shortage of cotton .
" i would n't really want to have any of the old east german chocolate again , " laughed busch-petersen , a lifelong east berliner .
but at some point in the mid-1990s , things began to change and east germans rediscovered their love of the products they had grown up with .
although some critics called the trend " ostalgie " and accused east germans of wanting to turn back the clock and return to communism , busch-petersen said the charges were unfounded .
" first , they recognized , that emperor has no clothes , that we also cook with water and that many products really were comparable , " busch-petersen told deutsche welle .
" second , people realized there was a relationship between the quality of their lives and their consumer preferences , " he continued .
" they 'd go buy a different washing powder and suddenly the wash powder factory around the corner was about to close because no one would buy the old east german stuff anymore . "
an east german care package indeed , east german washing powder is still available and can be found in an entire store full of other goods with east german origins in a store just a few meters from berlin 's alexanderplatz .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : although east german goods were n't flashy , many east germans say they lasted forever known as ostpaket , the store 's name is a play on words and recalls the days when germany was divided .
families living in the west could send their eastern relatives so-called westpaket , care packages filled with clothes , western foods and other items - with the east german government collecting a share of the sale of each box .
the store is one of dozens across the former east germany that caters to east germans who are looking for the goods they grew up with .
inside ostpaket , owner bianca schaeler said the east german goods were competitive with western rivals on both price and quality .
pointing to a shelf full of various flavors of the east german coffee brand rondo , she said product development has n't stopped since the wall fell and the company has been busy tweaking its offerings to find new consumers .
many germans from the " new federal states " as east germany is now known , make rondo and fellow east german coffee brand mocha fix gold their brew of choice , schaeler said the brands have become popular in western germany , too , thanks to discount chains which aggressively push the labels as a cheap quality substitute for jacobs and other big german coffees .
a sparkling success perhaps the most successful brand to have survived communism and thrive since then is germany 's biggest sparkling wine brand , rotkaeppchen , which means red riding hood .
the winery , based in the state of saxony-anhalt , is over 150 years old and was expropriated by the east german regime after world war two .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the most successful east german brands is rottkaeppchen sparkling wine after reunification , the company was privatized and has thrived since then , selling nearly 140 million bottles of bubbly last year and bringing in revenues of over 700 million euros .
in 2002 , rotkaeppchen even managed to buy one of its biggest rivals , the west german mumm winery , which has given rotkaeppchen a lock on about 40 percent of the german sparkling wine market .
that 's given rotkaeppchen access to more premium markets for its wares , a strategy other east german brands have tried as well , running in the face of long-held stereotypes of poor quality .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 03.10.2009 ireland says " yes " to eu treaty in key vote großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this time around , irish voters gave the thumbs-up to the treaty irish officials said saturday voters had strongly approved the eu 's lisbon treaty in a crucial second referendum , averting a major crisis and allowing the bloc to reform and gain more global clout . " i am delighted for the country .
it looks like a convincing win for the ' yes ' side on this occasion , " irish foreign minister micheal martin told national radio .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : irish premier cowen had urged voters to approve the eu treaty the tipperary south constituency in southern ireland , which rejected the treaty by 53 percent in a first referendum in june 2008 , backed it with 68.42 percent in favour and 31.58 percent against in friday 's vote . a total of 3,078,032 irish citizens were eligible to vote .
reports said turnout was around 50 percent across the country compared to 53 percent in 2008 .
official results of the referendum are due around 1630 gmt .
eu hails victory swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called it " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us . "
european commission president jose manuel barroso said ireland 's support for the treaty showed europe 's response to the global economic crisis has been positive .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso viewed the " yes " vote as confirmation of the eu 's response to the fiancial crisis " it -lrb- support for the treaty -rrb- shows the value of european solidarity and i am really glad with the result we are receiving from ireland , " barroso told reporters .
" it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish on saturday . she was speaking to reporters while in the german city of saarbruecken for german unity day celebrations . " i would like to congratulate the irish people on the outcome of the referendum and also my colleague brian cowen , " she said .
" this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty and i may say that germany , on german unity day , is very happy about the outcome . " ireland delivered a stunning blow to the eu in june 2008 , when voters rejected the reform treaty by 53.4 percent .
a second ‘ no ' vote could have risked plunging the bloc into another crisis and stalling long-delayed reforms .
the so-called lisbon treaty is aimed at simplifying and speeding up decision-making in the expanded 27-nation bloc .
opinion polls pointed to a “ yes ” vote opinion polls ahead of the vote had suggested the “ yes ” camp was set to win comfortably this time , with voters likely to have been swayed by their fears of battling the sharp recession while cast on the fringes of the eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " no " campaign had said the treaty would force unpopular decisions on ireland leaders across the continent watched the poll anxiously , as most wanted an end to the constitutional paralysis in the eu since last year 's irish no vote .
prime minister brian cowen , and other pro-lisbon leaders had expressed cautious optimism .
" it 's an important day for the country and an important referendum , " he said on friday , according to the irish examiner newspaper 's website .
there were concerns that some voters would use the referendum to punish cowen 's increasingly unpopular government over the spectacular collapse of ireland 's booming " celtic tiger " economy .
ireland risked being marginalized in the end , however , voters listened to prime minister cowen 's call to set aside their anger towards him over the economy and vote " yes " to cement ireland 's position within europe and help it recover from recession .
analysts also warned that a second " no " could cost ireland valuable goodwill from overseas investors who it relies on to fund a ballooning budget deficit .
an irish " yes " vote was bound to be seen as a boon for the former " celtic tiger " , which was spared an icelandic-style collapse due to its membership of the eurozone .
experts say the country is still reliant on goodwill from brussels and frankfurt , where the european central bank is based , for its future recovery .
the referendum came at a time when many people in ireland are struggling to come to terms with unemployment , higher taxes and the possibility of lower social welfare payments in the next austerity budget .
analysts said irish borrowing costs would likely drop and its banking stocks rise when stock markets open on monday if the result was a " yes .

berlin 's struggling soccer team hertha presented their new coach friedhelm funkel on saturday .
hertha are currently in last place in the bundesliga after a sixth straight defeat , and suffered a mid-week loss in europe . the 55-year-old funkel is due take his first training session on saturday afternoon , and will preside over his first game on sunday , when hertha host league-leaders hamburg at berlin 's olympic stadium .
" we are convinced that we can turn the season around with friedhelm funkel and work our way out of the bottom step by step , " hertha 's sporting director michael preetz said .
funkel expressed similar enthusiasm : " for me , hertha is a top club , even if it currently does n't look that way on the table , " he said , " the team has the potential , and we want to try to tap that in the coming weeks . "
funkel the former frankfurter but the new trainer , who coached eintracht frankfurt for the last five seasons , warned against unrealistic expectations .
" we should n't expect any miracles .
it 'll take a bit of time .
but we wo n't just try , we will succeed , " he said .
hertha sacked swiss coach lucien favre last monday after a horrific start to the season , in which the club picked up only three points from their first seven games .
this was a serious blow to the confidence of a team that was in the race to be german champion for the first time for almost all of last season .
hertha ended up finishing fourth , only narrowly missing out on a champions league .
funkel arrives in the capital with plenty of bundesliga experience , having coached five other top-flight teams in his 18-year career .
he left frankfurt by mutual consent in the summer , a season earlier than his contract stipulated. bk / dpa / sid editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one of those is the existence of an entirely independent development ministry , which outgoing social democrat development minister heidemarie wiezcorek-zeul once said was the envy of many nations . most industrialized countries incorporate the development portfolio into their foreign ministries , which – if the fdp has its way – is the path that germany will also take .
that would leave party leader guido westerwelle , expected to take over as foreign minister , in charge of development aid . the fdp 's view could prove to be a point of contention in coalition talks with chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who do not support the abolition of the development ministry . claudia warning , the head of venro , an umbrella organization for development aid groups , says a strong ministry will ensure that aid commitments are adhered to , despite a strained budget in the wake of the global financial crisis . " after all , the rich industrialized nations caused the current crisis , " warning said .
" the poorer countries must not be punished for it by less development aid coming their way in the future . " no aid for china bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : westerwelle is expected to take over the foreign ministry westerwelle wants germany to stop sending aid to rapidly industrializing nations , such as china , india and brazil , saying it makes no sense to send millions of euros to such countries while the government is unable to balance the budget at home . this stance has the german green party up in arms .
greens lawmaker thilo hoppe told deutsche welle that only a separate ministry would be capable of dealing with the challenges ahead . " if you just attach development aid to the foreign ministry , as has been done in other countries , it 's bound to only play a marginal role , " hoppe said . the introduction of the first independent development ministry in 1961 was championed by walter scheel , a leading member of the free democrats , who was later elected as the federal president of the former west germany .

" the irish have spoken with a clear voice .
it is a good day for ireland and a good day for europe , " cowen said in dublin shortly before the official announcement of the results .
67 percent of irish voters voted in favor of the treaty , while 33 percent voted against .
turnout in the three-million electorate was 58 percent .
jose manuel barroso , president of the european commission , told reporters in brussels , " it shows the value of european solidarity .
it shows the very positive response that europe is bringing to the economic and financial crisis . "
vote hailed as pro-europe choice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : angela merkel was among the eu leaders to congratulate ireland german chancellor angela merkel congratulated the irish people during her celebrations of german unity day , saying , " this is an important step on the path to the lisbon treaty . "
her sentiments were shared by germany 's outgoing foreign minister and new opposition leader frank-walter steinmeier .
" the irish yes vote brings us a large step closer to the necessary reforms in the eu , " he said . swedish foreign minister carl bildt , whose country currently holds the eu presidency , called the vote " an important victory for ireland and for all of europe . "
he said it was just a matter of time until the eu " finally can push the button for the better european co-operation that the lisbon treaty will give us " .
british prime minister gordon brown also hailed ireland 's " yes " vote , saying the bloc could now move forward on key areas like the economy .
spain said it would make the treaty 's implementation a priority during its eu presidency in the first half of 2010 .
" the spanish presidency of the european union will implement this treaty , which symbolizes the new europe of the 21st century .
we are very pleased with this very clear victory of the yes side .
the period of uncertainty is over , " secretary of state for the eu , diego lopez garrido , told reporters .
pressure on poland and czech republic the lisbon treaty is now awaiting ratification from poland and czech republic , the last two member states not to have done so .
irish approval is considered a strong signal to those countries to follow suit , and some eu diplomats expect the polish parliament to ratify the treaty within the next few days .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech president vaclav klaus insists he will await the decision of the constitutional court but approval from prague threatens to be more difficult to extract .
after the irish vote , euroskeptic president vaclav klaus repeated he was not ready to sign the treaty until the czech constitutional court assesses a request by a group of senators to consider whether the treaty complies with the country 's constitution .
klaus , a vocal critic of the treaty , said saturday he " fully respects " the irish decision , but felt obliged to await the court 's decision .
czech prime minister jan fischer welcomed the outcome of the irish vote .
the treaty is designed to speed up and simplify decision-making as well as overhaul institutions in the 27-nation bloc .
it has been criticized in many member states , including germany , where the constitutional court forced the parliament to alter legislation relating to the treaty .
swedish prime minister and current president of the european council fredrik reinfeldt said that ireland 's previous referendum 16 months ago , when the country voted against ratification , had led to changes in the treaty .
" europe listened to the concerns of the irish people and addressed them , " he said .
a second " no " vote by the irish would have effectively killed the treaty , which notably creates a new full-time president and foreign minister for the 27-nation eu , home to some 500 million europeans. bk / afp / dpa / ap editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de africa -pipe- 03.10.2009 europe unprepared to cope with migration , experts say großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a memorial to refugees who died on their journey on the italian island of lampedusa german aid workers are on trial in sicily for rescuing african refugees after their boat sank in the mediterranean five years ago .
the trial has raised questions about how europe deals with illegal immigration . italian prosecutors argue the aid workers were trafficking illegal immigrants , an offense that is punishable with up to four years in prison .
a tunisian fisherman is also being tried for people trafficking .
while the trial in sicily shines a spotlight on past incidents involving illegal immigration , europe still has n't worked out how to treat and deal with people who risk their lives trying to reach the continent .
just two weeks ago fifty africans drowned in the straight of gibraltar while heading for spain .
their small boat sank off the moroccan coast , only eleven people survived .
a few days earlier border police rescued six african children in a rubber boat off the spanish coast .
still , in the first six months of the year the number of illegal migrants trying to reach europe by sea dropped dramatically to 15,700 compared to 67,000 in the first half of 2008 .
the steep decline is due to a new agreement between italy and libya , says the united nations high commissioner for refugees -lrb- unhcr -rrb- .
it allows the italian navy to return migrants , picked up in international waters , without giving them the opportunity to apply for asylum first .
on the route between between africa and the canary islands , which belong to spain , europe 's border patrol agency frontex , has registered fewer immigrants as well , says its spokesman michal parzyszek : " the flow of detected illegal migrants to the canary islands has decreased during the last two years .
last year there was a decrease between 15 and 20 percent compared to 2007 , ” he says .
better life bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : immigrants staged a protest in lampedusa earlier this year but despite efforts to combat illegal immigration and the current downward trend , rupert neudeck from the german aid organisation green helmets does n't expect this to continue .
he estimates that 18 million mainly young africans are ready to leave the continent for better living conditions abroad .
most of them want to make it to europe one day .
neudeck is an expert on the issue .
already in the 1970s he rescued boat people , as vietnamese refugees were called then .
but the current situation in africa is totally different .
“ we can not compare it with the vietnamese boat people , because they were persecuted , " he says .
" they were political refugees .
they had a legal title by the unhcr .
african boat people today are going abroad for better job opportunities , a better standard of living , a perspective .
they are just as legal , but they do n't have this internationally recognised title .
that 's a big difference . ”
lack of european policy for neudeck , migration is a human right that allows a person to leave one 's country in search of a better living conditions elsewhere .
" our forefathers went to america , which was considered to be legal .
it is important to know that the aim for better conditions has nothing to do with illegality .
the other question is whether our policy in europe is allowing some of these people to enter and to work . ”
currently , however , the twenty seven european union member states do n't even have a common migration policy , but fifty african nations to talk to .
“ we have n't even come to the conclusion yet that we have to establish a partnership with these countries " , says neudeck and adds : " we are restricting ourselves to sealing off our borders and building a big task force of policemen to defend ourselves .
this is not a policy , it is the opposite of a policy .
it shows that we have n't understood our challenge yet . "
frontex spokesman parzyszek admits that the migration issue needs to be coordinated across the eu .
“ certainly we need migration policy at the european level , which covers the whole range of issues .
there are always fingers pointing at frontex .
but frontex is just about border control .
this is just a tiny part of migration policy . ”
offering opportunities neudeck is convinced that the migration issue ca n't be solved by border patrols and courts , but that its root causes need to be adressed .
he believes that the large majority of african migrants coming to europe would prefer to live in their own countries .
“ but they have no proper means to do this , ” he says .
“ so young people are being sent out of their country in order to achieve some kind of wealth and perspective for themselves and for their families staying behind . ”
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italian coast guard boat with rescued african migrants that 's why neudeck and his organisation green helmets urge to create more opportunities where they are really needed and before would-be migrants even leave for europe : “ in the main harbors in west africa we should establish more vocational training centers for youngsters and grant them micro credits to start a business at home , ” he says . ” we have done this in mauretania , where many small boats depart on a risky five , six day journey to the canary islands . ”
a two-pronged approach therefore is required to effectively deal with migration , says neudeck : “ giving young people the possibility to work in their own countries is as necessary as to recognise the right of people out on the ocean to be rescued and to stay in europe for a period of time at least . ”

two decades ago , few would have predicted that the country would soon be at the heart of a united europe . modern germany is only 19 years old .
it 's hard to believe that europe 's leading economy and a key player on the international political stage , could have been at the center of the cold war just two decades ago .
october 3 , 1990 , was the day on which the communist german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- officially ceased to exist and the federal republic of germany , previously the name for just the western part of the divided country , came to encompass both east and west .
as the clock struck midnight hundreds of thousands of germans celebrated outside the reichstag building in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the east german flag , adopted in 1959 , was abolished with reunification in 1990 germany has still not resolved all the issues surrounding reunification : studies often show that there are major differences in employment opportunities and incomes between those who live in what used to be west germany and those who live in the former east .
unity day celebrations on saturday , however , politicians and dignitaries will not be focusing on the negative aspects of reunification ; instead newly re-elected chancellor angela merkel and president horst koehler will pay tribute to those who made german unity possible . the main event is being held in the southern city of saarbruecken , following a tradition that unity day celebrations are held in the home town of the president of the bundesrat , germany 's upper house .
that position is currently held by peter mueller , premier of the state of saarland , of which saarbruecken is the capital .
in the german capital berlin , giant marionettes will be walking through the west and east of the city , a spectacle produced by french theater company royal de luxe .
recognition of reunification efforts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany marks the 20th anniversary of the fall of the berlin wall later this year ahead of saturday 's anniversary , the country 's federal centre for political education announced this year 's winners of its german unity prizes , which it awards every year to recognize people on outstanding contributions in bringing together east and west .
dresden-born civil rights activist and author freya klier and arno krause , head of the european academy in otzenhausen in the western state of saarland , both received prizes of honor .
klier was recognized for her long-lasting commitment to educating people about the former east germany , while krause was honored for his dedication to european unification .
further awards went to leipzig citizens ' committee chairman tobias hollitzer and the organizer of the international youth project " a world of friends " , roland spether .
the exhibition " peaceful revolution 1989/90 " by the robert havemann society and the german-polish magazine " dialogue " were also honored. ca / dpa / ap editor : andreas illmer send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no one was hurt in the attack which took place ahead of sunday 's election . the terrorist group , calling itself conspiracy of fire nuclei , posted a message online saying that the bomb was intended to " send a message " to greek authorities .
the statement said the group had infiltrated crowds of supporters of the prime minister 's new democracy party headed for the rally , a " stupid mass reminiscent of a zombie movie , " and had placed the bomb and slipped away without being spotted by the handful of police stationed nearby .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greece has suffered social unrest following the financial crisis the blast shattered windows at neighboring shops and caused minor damage to nearby motorbikes but the rally went ahead without further incident .
the terrorist group also claimed responsibility for another home-made bomb which exploded outside the home of a senior opposition socialist last week .
greek police arrested four suspected members of the group after that attack , though the online statement claimed that those arrested were not members of the group .
greece has suffered a spate of minor bombings by various political groups in recent weeks as civil unrest grows .
conservatives likely to lose the greek electorate will vote on sunday in a snap election in which the incumbent conservatives , who have struggled to cope with the economic crisis and social discontent , are expected to lose to the opposition socialists .
opinion polls suggest the greek socialist pasok party of giorgos papandreou will win , ending the rule of the karamanlis ' new democracy party after five and a half years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou , left and karamanlis karamanlis called an early election at the beginning of september , after several scandals and a deteriorating economic situation made his position untenable .
but it remains unclear whether the socialists would win an absolute majority in the 300-seat parliament and end up governing alone .
both karamanlis and papandreou have pledged to pull greece out of the economic crisis and root out corruption .
greece is in a serious economic crisis : the budget deficit is estimated to be twice the permitted eu ceiling of three percent and public debt is expected to exceed 100 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2009 .
on top of this , the financial crisis is likely to affect vital tourism revenues and unemployment is rising for the first time in years. bk / reuters / ap / afp editor : sonia phalnikar send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content few foreign policy shifts expected from new german coalition i think that germany should focus its attention deeper on latin america .
new technologies , management , productive innovation and technical assistance are very important to these countries .
just to give an example ; climate change requires new technological approaches , with which germany is quite familiar . - erico wulf , chile opinion : new government faces tough task the important message that angela merkel , in her first tenure as chancellor , held out for evolving democracies such as india was that two diametrically-opposite parties could come together , form a government and run it for its full term , despite their differences .
having achieved this , merkel should be able to lead for the full length of her second term .
i am hopeful and confident that she will be able to strike a healthy balance of power with the free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- and run the government successfully for one more term . - t. ramakrishnan , india european press review : cautious hopes for new german coalition the success of the fdp in german elections sunday may give inspiration to north americans who wish to advocate for business friendly reforms without being caught up in a movement obsessed with " conservative " social issues . - brian dell , canada two german states hold regional polls on election day i feel germany and german politics are in for a change .
the fdp , i feel , will keep the christian democrats -lrb- cdu -rrb- in check for social items , but with the cdu and fdp will be more business friendly and therefore keep more jobs at home , not like the us where so many are going to other countries , as it was in germany . - larry davis , us i feel angela merkel is a great role model for women in politics -lrb- maybe business too -rrb- .
she carries her power quietly but firmly .
she is the leader of her party and yet is not a " yelling harpy " as she tries to be tough like a man .
i really admire her and the way she is just herself but in a respectful way . - mishelle dicken , us pirate party : in the analog era , we were able to listen to music on the radio , tape and copy it for free .
then , we knew the artists and their music and therefore we would buy our own disks .
but nowadays , every digital source can not be used to make a copy .
so i 'm afraid that could i keep my favorites after that like as book - though they are in digital media .
i think people should not be slaves of copyright holders .
if the pirates aim to loose the fetters on us , they must be valuable . - snowman , japan is this is the future of germany ?
some drunken youths who believe every day is carneval ?
why would the german government pay a lot of money to this kind of party ?
is there no better way to spend taxpayer 's money ? - jimmy , thailand polanski vows to fight extradition from switzerland if it were anyone other than polanski , e.g. , an ordinary citizen , would anyone care if he was extradited to answer for his actions ?
i suspect the old adage that there are two justice systems in most countries ; one for the rich and another for everyone else , still exists .
my personal opinion is that he should have been extradited years ago by the poles or the french without delay . - robert martinson , canada polanski should pay all the fines to the american authorities and compensation to the victim that are due .
after that he can go home free without any extradition which would cost tax payers even more . - krasimir , bulgaria it 's important to note that in the us a crime such as the one that mr. polanski admitted to , by law , is not only against the victim but our society as well .
therefore , the charges pending against mr. polanski are brought by ' the people of the state ' .
the fact that the victim forgives him , though commendable , is irrelevant in the matter of the case moving forward .
being a world renowned film maker is not a ' get out of jail ' pass .
he should be extradited and prosecuted like every other child rapist . - nathan vitatoe , us send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year 's festivities have been marred by security concerns . the public holiday pays tribute to the moment when the two germanys were peacefully reunified on october 3 1990 , after nearly four decades of confrontation during the cold war .
in the capital berlin , spectators watched a 15-metre tall string-puppet emerge from the spree river and parade as part of a performance entitled " rendez-vous in berlin " by french puppet masters royal de luxe .
later on saturday , the puppet is to greet a second giant marionette in a symbolic gesture at the historic brandenburg gate , a former border of the once-divided city .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual celebrations - a french theater group led massive puppets through berlin no wall , but barriers remain the focus of official ceremonies was the south-western city of saarbruecken , where germany 's recently re-elected chancellor angela merkel called on the country to overcome the lingering inequalities which continue to stoke resentment between eastern and western germans .
" now is the time for us to forge a common future , " merkel said , following a church service also attended by german president horst koehler .
studies show that despite billions of euros of investment in germany 's formerly communist eastern states , unemployment remains significantly higher , and income significantly lower , than the national average .
but merkel noted in her speech that parts of western germany were now no better off than some parts of the east .
merkel also said that the current economic crisis was " perhaps the first great challenge " for a re-unified germany .
she added that east germans ' struggle against their former communist regime set an " example " of the determination needed to tackle the current crisis .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's political elite converged on the official ceremony in saarbruecken merkel also said german unity was brought about by the bravery of thousands of its citizens .
" it didn ’ t fall from the heavens , " merkel said .
" it was the result of bravery , decisiveness and civic courage . "
security concerns this year 's ceremonies have been accompanied by heightened security .
islamist groups have issued a number of internet threats in recent weeks , warning they would attack germany over its participation in the war in afghanistan .
police also arrested a german-turkish national on friday suspected of recruiting for al qaeda and obtaining bomb-making materials .
the city of berlin 's interior minister ehrhart koerting said police would be reinforced due to " a changed security situation . "
security has also been tightened at munich 's oktoberfest , while up to 1,500 police have been deployed to the site of official unity day ceremonies in saarbruecken .
the regional capital of the state of saarland was chosen as the location for official ceremonies in line with a tradition that designates the honor to the home town of the sitting president of germany 's upper house of parliament .
the current president of the bundesrat is saarland 's conservative premier , peter mueller .

consumer groups are calling for banks to change their approach to card fraud when a customer 's pin has been used after the theft of a purse or wallet .
banks usually reimburse fraud victims , unless the customer acted fraudulently or without " reasonable care " .
but some banks are now turning down claims , saying customers must have left a copy of the pin with their card .
the banking industry says chip and pin is secure and each dispute is judged on its own merits .
richard elphick , a chartered surveyor , told radio 4 's money box he had his wallet stolen while he was eating outside a central london restaurant in july .
although he cancelled his cards within the hour , the thief still had time to withdraw £ 100 cash from an atm using his natwest credit card , and make other purchases and withdrawals using his natwest debit card .
in total the fraud came to £ 2,300 .
question of liability natwest refunded the £ 100 mr elphick lost on his credit card , saying that as he had used the card that day it was credible his pin might have been observed .
but it refused to repay the money taken from his debit card , arguing there had been no explanation for how the pin number became known to the fraudster .
" mr elphick 's debit card had not been used for 13 days prior to the theft , " said natwest .
" his exact debit card pin was successfully used for all the fraudulent transactions .
we can only conclude that mr elphick kept a record of his debit card pin in his wallet . "
but mr elphick emphatically denies his pin number was in his wallet .
richard elphick wants natwest to refund the stolen money " they were n't written down anywhere and i do n't know how anyone could get access to them , " he said .
" it makes no sense to me at all , the rules should be the same for both . "
the banking code says a customer is only liable for the first £ 50 in cases like this , unless the bank can prove the customer acted fraudulently , or " without reasonable care . "
the banking umbrella group , the uk payments administration , agrees that its members must abide by the code .
" the bank or card company must be able to demonstrate that the customer has either been negligent with their cards details , or that they are a knowing party to the fraud , before turning down a customer 's fraud claim . "
cathy neal from the consumer organisation which ? believes banks need to rethink how they interpret these guidelines .
" there are just too many cases like this for it to be people actually being careless , " she said .
" if people are saying they have n't been careless , you have to call into question the kind of proof that they 're using . "
chip and pin security expert steven murdoch from the university of cambridge believes there are a variety of ways fraudsters could obtain pins , from compromising pin entry devices in shops to bank staff divulging customer details .
natwest insists it is not possible for a fraudster to read the pin on any of their cards , nor for their staff to ever know someone 's pin number .
bbc radio 4 's money box is broadcast on saturdays at 12 noon , and repeated on sundays at 2100h .

consumer groups are calling for banks to change their approach to card fraud when a customer 's pin has been used after the theft of a purse or wallet .
banks usually reimburse fraud victims , unless the customer acted fraudulently or without " reasonable care " .
but some banks are now turning down claims , saying customers must have left a copy of the pin with their card .
the banking industry says chip and pin is secure and each dispute is judged on its own merits .
richard elphick , a chartered surveyor , told radio 4 's money box he had his wallet stolen while he was eating outside a central london restaurant in july .
although he cancelled his cards within the hour , the thief still had time to withdraw £ 100 cash from an atm using his natwest credit card , and make other purchases and withdrawals using his natwest debit card .
in total the fraud came to £ 2,300 .
question of liability natwest refunded the £ 100 mr elphick lost on his credit card , saying that as he had used the card that day it was credible his pin might have been observed .
but it refused to repay the money taken from his debit card , arguing there had been no explanation for how the pin number became known to the fraudster .
" mr elphick 's debit card had not been used for 13 days prior to the theft , " said natwest .
" his exact debit card pin was successfully used for all the fraudulent transactions .
we can only conclude that mr elphick kept a record of his debit card pin in his wallet . "
but mr elphick emphatically denies his pin number was in his wallet .
richard elphick wants natwest to refund the stolen money " they were n't written down anywhere and i do n't know how anyone could get access to them , " he said .
" it makes no sense to me at all , the rules should be the same for both . "
the banking code says a customer is only liable for the first £ 50 in cases like this , unless the bank can prove the customer acted fraudulently , or " without reasonable care . "
the banking umbrella group , the uk payments administration , agrees that its members must abide by the code .
" the bank or card company must be able to demonstrate that the customer has either been negligent with their cards details , or that they are a knowing party to the fraud , before turning down a customer 's fraud claim . "
cathy neal from the consumer organisation which ? believes banks need to rethink how they interpret these guidelines .
" there are just too many cases like this for it to be people actually being careless , " she said .
" if people are saying they have n't been careless , you have to call into question the kind of proof that they 're using . "
chip and pin security expert steven murdoch from the university of cambridge believes there are a variety of ways fraudsters could obtain pins , from compromising pin entry devices in shops to bank staff divulging customer details .
natwest insists it is not possible for a fraudster to read the pin on any of their cards , nor for their staff to ever know someone 's pin number .
bbc radio 4 's money box is broadcast on saturdays at 12 noon , and repeated on sundays at 2100h .

consumer groups are calling for banks to change their approach to card fraud when a customer 's pin has been used after the theft of a purse or wallet .
banks usually reimburse fraud victims , unless the customer acted fraudulently or without " reasonable care " .
but some banks are now turning down claims , saying customers must have left a copy of the pin with their card .
the banking industry says chip and pin is secure and each dispute is judged on its own merits .
richard elphick , a chartered surveyor , told radio 4 's money box he had his wallet stolen while he was eating outside a central london restaurant in july .
although he cancelled his cards within the hour , the thief still had time to withdraw £ 100 cash from an atm using his natwest credit card , and make other purchases and withdrawals using his natwest debit card .
in total the fraud came to £ 2,300 .
question of liability natwest refunded the £ 100 mr elphick lost on his credit card , saying that as he had used the card that day it was credible his pin might have been observed .
but it refused to repay the money taken from his debit card , arguing there had been no explanation for how the pin number became known to the fraudster .
" mr elphick 's debit card had not been used for 13 days prior to the theft , " said natwest .
" his exact debit card pin was successfully used for all the fraudulent transactions .
we can only conclude that mr elphick kept a record of his debit card pin in his wallet . "
but mr elphick emphatically denies his pin number was in his wallet .
richard elphick wants natwest to refund the stolen money " they were n't written down anywhere and i do n't know how anyone could get access to them , " he said .
" it makes no sense to me at all , the rules should be the same for both . "
the banking code says a customer is only liable for the first £ 50 in cases like this , unless the bank can prove the customer acted fraudulently , or " without reasonable care . "
the banking umbrella group , the uk payments administration , agrees that its members must abide by the code .
" the bank or card company must be able to demonstrate that the customer has either been negligent with their cards details , or that they are a knowing party to the fraud , before turning down a customer 's fraud claim . "
cathy neal from the consumer organisation which ? believes banks need to rethink how they interpret these guidelines .
" there are just too many cases like this for it to be people actually being careless , " she said .
" if people are saying they have n't been careless , you have to call into question the kind of proof that they 're using . "
chip and pin security expert steven murdoch from the university of cambridge believes there are a variety of ways fraudsters could obtain pins , from compromising pin entry devices in shops to bank staff divulging customer details .
natwest insists it is not possible for a fraudster to read the pin on any of their cards , nor for their staff to ever know someone 's pin number .
bbc radio 4 's money box is broadcast on saturdays at 12 noon , and repeated on sundays at 2100h .
