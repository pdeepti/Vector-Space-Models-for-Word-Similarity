formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a site that is shared uneasily by six denominations of christians : greek orthodox , roman catholic , armenian orthodox , egyptian copts and syrian and ethiopian orthodox . easter , or pascha , is the holiest feast in the christian calendar .
about 10,000 worshippers gained entry to the holy sepulcher church on saturday to attend the holy fire ritual , which is celebrated on the eve of orthodox easter and honors the belief that a holy fire appears spontaneously from jesus ' tomb as a message that he has not forgotten his followers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian leaders and their wives joined the crowds for the orthodox service in previous years scuffles have threatened to disrupt the celebrations as different denominations of orthodox believers battle over the rights to enter the tomb first . light from the holy fire follows a route from jerusalem to the church of the nativity in bethlehem , where christian tradition holds jesus was born , and is then carried aboard special flights to athens and other cities . in the russian capital , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev attended an overnight service led by the newly elected russian orthodox patriarch kirill , in the cathedral of christ the savior in central moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian patriarch kirill celebrated an easter service in moscow the russian orthodox church enjoys a position of influence in the country and is expected to increase its members since the election of the charismatic patriarch .
some 4.5 million people across the country attended easter services , which traditionally last several hours over saturday-sunday night . greek orthodox , armenians and other eastern orthodox christians mark easter a week after protestants and catholics as the orthodox church follows a different calendar . tw / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .

last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies . " clearly there has been a shift recently and we 're hopeful that it 's going to continue , " marc garlasco , senior analyst at new york-based human rights watch , which has repeatedly criticized the military over the issue , told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is set to take over as nato chief in august nato 's reputation in afghanistan suffered a further blow after the taliban called the incoming nato chief a " major enemy " of muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammad when prime minister of denmark . anders fogh rasmussen , danish premier until earlier this month , is due in august to become secretary general of nato . the publication of the cartoons in a danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the muslim world , including bloody protests in afghanistan in which several people were killed .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .

" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .

dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .
the attacks have disrupted un aid supplies , driven up insurance costs and forced some shipping companies to route cargo round south africa , rather than risk approaching somalia . nk / tt , ap / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies . " clearly there has been a shift recently and we 're hopeful that it 's going to continue , " marc garlasco , senior analyst at new york-based human rights watch , which has repeatedly criticized the military over the issue , told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is set to take over as nato chief in august nato 's reputation in afghanistan suffered a further blow after the taliban called the incoming nato chief a " major enemy " of muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammad when prime minister of denmark . anders fogh rasmussen , danish premier until earlier this month , is due in august to become secretary general of nato . the publication of the cartoons in a danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the muslim world , including bloody protests in afghanistan in which several people were killed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 19.04.2009 red bull 's high-flyer , sebastian vettel wins in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has delivered his best performances in the wet he 's the youngest man in f1 , he 's never been at a big budget team , yet he still finds a way to get the job done .
formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies . " clearly there has been a shift recently and we 're hopeful that it 's going to continue , " marc garlasco , senior analyst at new york-based human rights watch , which has repeatedly criticized the military over the issue , told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is set to take over as nato chief in august nato 's reputation in afghanistan suffered a further blow after the taliban called the incoming nato chief a " major enemy " of muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammad when prime minister of denmark . anders fogh rasmussen , danish premier until earlier this month , is due in august to become secretary general of nato . the publication of the cartoons in a danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the muslim world , including bloody protests in afghanistan in which several people were killed .
rasmussen had defended the publication of the cartoons on the grounds of free speech and refused to apologize to muslim countries . us and nato commanders say insurgents are still responsible for the majority of civilian deaths , blaming a surge in violence on taliban fighting tactics . tw / sms , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it is a site that is shared uneasily by six denominations of christians : greek orthodox , roman catholic , armenian orthodox , egyptian copts and syrian and ethiopian orthodox . easter , or pascha , is the holiest feast in the christian calendar .
about 10,000 worshippers gained entry to the holy sepulcher church on saturday to attend the holy fire ritual , which is celebrated on the eve of orthodox easter and honors the belief that a holy fire appears spontaneously from jesus ' tomb as a message that he has not forgotten his followers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian leaders and their wives joined the crowds for the orthodox service in previous years scuffles have threatened to disrupt the celebrations as different denominations of orthodox believers battle over the rights to enter the tomb first . light from the holy fire follows a route from jerusalem to the church of the nativity in bethlehem , where christian tradition holds jesus was born , and is then carried aboard special flights to athens and other cities . in the russian capital , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev attended an overnight service led by the newly elected russian orthodox patriarch kirill , in the cathedral of christ the savior in central moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian patriarch kirill celebrated an easter service in moscow the russian orthodox church enjoys a position of influence in the country and is expected to increase its members since the election of the charismatic patriarch .
some 4.5 million people across the country attended easter services , which traditionally last several hours over saturday-sunday night . greek orthodox , armenians and other eastern orthodox christians mark easter a week after protestants and catholics as the orthodox church follows a different calendar . tw / sms , afp / ap / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 19.04.2009 red bull 's high-flyer , sebastian vettel wins in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has delivered his best performances in the wet he 's the youngest man in f1 , he 's never been at a big budget team , yet he still finds a way to get the job done .
formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .

nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.04.2009 steinmeier determined to topple merkel in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says he wants a " fresh start towards something better " in germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has kicked off the social democrats ' election campaign by declaring his resolve to oust the conservative coalition partner from the chancellery in september 's national vote . " we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .

the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

the raid in the village of montrauriol was part of a joint operation between spanish and french police . as part of the same operation , a further six suspected eta members were held during the night in the cities of bilbao and vitoria and the town of renteria in spain 's northern basque region . martitegi and the two other men were carrying pistols and had a stolen car with false license plates at the time of the arrest . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jurdan martitegi , eta 's new military leader known is also known as " the giant .

it is a site that is shared uneasily by six denominations of christians : greek orthodox , roman catholic , armenian orthodox , egyptian copts and syrian and ethiopian orthodox . easter , or pascha , is the holiest feast in the christian calendar .
about 10,000 worshippers gained entry to the holy sepulcher church on saturday to attend the holy fire ritual , which is celebrated on the eve of orthodox easter and honors the belief that a holy fire appears spontaneously from jesus ' tomb as a message that he has not forgotten his followers . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian leaders and their wives joined the crowds for the orthodox service in previous years scuffles have threatened to disrupt the celebrations as different denominations of orthodox believers battle over the rights to enter the tomb first . light from the holy fire follows a route from jerusalem to the church of the nativity in bethlehem , where christian tradition holds jesus was born , and is then carried aboard special flights to athens and other cities . in the russian capital , prime minister vladimir putin and president dmitry medvedev attended an overnight service led by the newly elected russian orthodox patriarch kirill , in the cathedral of christ the savior in central moscow . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian patriarch kirill celebrated an easter service in moscow the russian orthodox church enjoys a position of influence in the country and is expected to increase its members since the election of the charismatic patriarch .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany undecided on attending un racism talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany and the european union are still debating whether they should attend a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny or denigrate the holocaust . " sje / tt , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 19.04.2009 red bull 's high-flyer , sebastian vettel wins in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has delivered his best performances in the wet he 's the youngest man in f1 , he 's never been at a big budget team , yet he still finds a way to get the job done .
formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you !

in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .

the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .

it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?

" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .

judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "

" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny the holocaust . " nrt / th / md , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.04.2009 steinmeier determined to topple merkel in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says he wants a " fresh start towards something better " in germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has kicked off the social democrats ' election campaign by declaring his resolve to oust the conservative coalition partner from the chancellery in september 's national vote . " we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de afghanistan -pipe- 19.04.2009 afghan president calls on nato general to explain civilian deaths großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 8,000 people were estimated to have died in afghanistan in 2008 for the second time in three days , afghanistan 's president hamid karzai has called on the country 's top nato general to explain civilian casualties caused by international forces . civilian deaths caused by foreign troops in afghanistan in their fight to defeat the taliban have become a major cause of friction between the afghan government and its western backers , and have cost nato the vital support of ordinary afghans .
last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies . " clearly there has been a shift recently and we 're hopeful that it 's going to continue , " marc garlasco , senior analyst at new york-based human rights watch , which has repeatedly criticized the military over the issue , told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is set to take over as nato chief in august nato 's reputation in afghanistan suffered a further blow after the taliban called the incoming nato chief a " major enemy " of muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammad when prime minister of denmark . anders fogh rasmussen , danish premier until earlier this month , is due in august to become secretary general of nato . the publication of the cartoons in a danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the muslim world , including bloody protests in afghanistan in which several people were killed .
rasmussen had defended the publication of the cartoons on the grounds of free speech and refused to apologize to muslim countries . us and nato commanders say insurgents are still responsible for the majority of civilian deaths , blaming a surge in violence on taliban fighting tactics . tw / sms , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de formula one -pipe- 19.04.2009 red bull 's high-flyer , sebastian vettel wins in china großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel has delivered his best performances in the wet he 's the youngest man in f1 , he 's never been at a big budget team , yet he still finds a way to get the job done .
formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.04.2009 steinmeier determined to topple merkel in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says he wants a " fresh start towards something better " in germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has kicked off the social democrats ' election campaign by declaring his resolve to oust the conservative coalition partner from the chancellery in september 's national vote . " we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny the holocaust . " nrt / th / md , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .

formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .
together we made it .
thank you , thank you , thank you so much . "
record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .
however , it would n't be the first time that the young speedster from the western german town of heppenheim made racing history faster than anyone had expected . author : mark hallam editor : sean sinico send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .

his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .

record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .

it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you !

vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.04.2009 steinmeier determined to topple merkel in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says he wants a " fresh start towards something better " in germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has kicked off the social democrats ' election campaign by declaring his resolve to oust the conservative coalition partner from the chancellery in september 's national vote . " we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de elections -pipe- 19.04.2009 steinmeier determined to topple merkel in german elections großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier says he wants a " fresh start towards something better " in germany foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier has kicked off the social democrats ' election campaign by declaring his resolve to oust the conservative coalition partner from the chancellery in september 's national vote . " we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .
the grand coalition of spd and cdu has been shaky ever since its inception following the election stalemate four years ago .
both parties are hoping to govern with a more agreeable and smaller coalition partner after the september poll . nk / tt , afp / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de german social democrats pledge more money for low-income earners leaders of germany 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- have unanimously approved an election manifesto ahead of september 's federal poll , hoping the promise of more cash will win over voters .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .

judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2009 deutsche bahn hit by new spying allegations großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bahn is caught up in a full-blown snoop scandal in an ever-expanding spying scandal , the german national rail operator has now admitted to searching the computer hard drives of its employees , but only in those cases when criminal activity was suspected . deutsche bahn employees ' computer files were scrutinized " only in those cases , in which there was a concrete suspicion of internal company data being illegally passed on , " the company said in a statement on sunday , april 19 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de government proposes grube as deutsche bahn head ruediger grube - whose experience includes daimler and eads - set to take over germany 's rail company , deutsche bahn .
his first task will be to get beyond the company 's ongoing spying scandal .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .

" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny the holocaust . " nrt / th / md , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

formula one rising star sebastian vettel has , so far , had a brief but astounding career . sebastian vettel mastered the slippery conditions in shanghai to win the chinese grand prix from pole position .
despite heavy rain , two safety car periods and a slew of accidents on track , vettel managed to make the win look easy .
the result , his second career win , only ever looked in doubt when rookie sebastien buemi in red bull 's sister team toro rosso bumped into the back of vettel 's car .
but the shunt did n't appear to damage vettel 's racing ability as he let loose with a string of fastest laps during the race and enjoyed a comfortable margin of victory .
vettel has moved up to third position in the driver 's championship , behind brawn gp drivers jenson button and rubens barrichello .
his new team for 2009 , red bull racing , had never won a race before , and with australian teammate mark webber crossing the line in second on sunday , it has been a dream weekend for red bull .
" thank you for working so hard on the car , " vettel said on team radio after crossing the line " it was a dream to drive today .

record breaker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel caused quite a stir in his first f1 race as a stand-in for bmw sauber wherever sebastian vettel goes , success and records follow .
in 2006 he made history just by getting into a bmw f1 car .
at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .
vettel set no more records that year in a toro rosso which often struggled to keep up with the bigger teams .
but minnows toro rosso just needed to show a little patience , their faith in vettel 's talent would pay off in spades in 2008 . new kid in town bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : monza 2008 : a star is born .
it was at the italian grand prix 2008 in monza that sebastian vettel established himself as more than just another young racing talent . for the first time in three decades the italian summer weather failed to deliver on grand prix weekend , it rained heavily .
the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .
vettel 's success was the first ever win for toro rosso , which has been in f1 under a variety of names since 1985 and has usually finished near the back of the field . the life of sebastian bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vettel gives new team red bull their first ever win after just three races now 21 years old , vettel said comedy is amongst his biggest passions off the track , adding that british surrealist troupe monty python is his favorite , betraying his fluent command of english and his quick wit . clean-cut , maturing , but still baby-faced , he 's a popular figure in the paddock .
however , that could change in 2009 if he continues to fight at the front . realizing he may not continue to enjoy his opponents ' companionship , vettel once joked , " if you want a friend in the pit lane , then bring your dog here with you ! " like the majority of f1 drivers , vettel has been racing since he was a young lad , and he 's won virtually every junior series he ever entered .
now , the question is how his career will progress . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daring to dream ?
vettel is faster than most people expected this year .
traditionally , his current employer red bull would not be considered as an f1 front runner .
that 's led many observers to tip vettel for a short stay with red bull , followed by a move to a big money outfit like ferrari or mclaren mercedes . but in a 2009 season turned upside down by new technical regulations , vettel 's red bull car suddenly looks like one of the quickest in the field , and the young driver may have to get used to bigger , richer teams breathing down his neck . most people have tipped this young german as a future world champion for some time now , but very few would have suggested that 2009 could be his year .

at the turkish grand prix , vettel took to the track aged 19 years and 53 days as test driver , becoming the youngest man ever to drive at an f1 race meeting .
nine seconds later , he set another record , becoming the fastest driver ever to be fined for breaking the rules .
on his first ever run out of the pit lane , vettel broke the speed limit and promptly received a $ 1,000 fine . vettel 's big break came in 2007 when he replaced injured bmw driver robert kubica and finished eighth in the us grand prix in indianapolis . this strong showing got the attention of red bull racing , who snapped him up to drive for their sister team toro rosso late in the 2007 season .

the wet weather conditions slowed down some of the front runners , putting more emphasis on driver skill than on car speed .
suddenly toro rosso , with vettel in the cockpit and a sure-footed car in the rain , looked like a contender . the german grabbed pole position then comfortably drove to victory and became the youngest grand prix winner of all time .

last year , gen. david mckiernan , who is in charge of the 70,000 nato troops based in afghanistan , implemented new rules of engagement intended to cut down on the deaths of innocent afghans , but they still occur , especially in night-time raids . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mckiernan is trying to improve the negative image of foreign troops in afghanistan international forces have gone some way to try and blunt some of the damage by responding more quickly , coordinating their investigations with afghan authorities , apologizing publicly and offering compensation . " we have worked very hard at this to ensure that we can get to get to the truth of what has taken place as quickly as possible and maintain the support of the population , " mckiernan 's spokesman told reuters news agency this week . but skepticism among afghans is still strong , and karzai , who faces presidential elections in august , continues to warn foreign forces that they are in danger of losing any public acceptance they may still enjoy .
the latest meeting between karzai and mckiernan relates to the reported deaths of six civilians in two incidents . in the past week , international forces have already been forced to apologize for the killings of afghans in the khost and kunar provinces .
in both cases , the military initially said they had been targeting militants .
within days , they had confessed to killing civilians and issued public apologies . " clearly there has been a shift recently and we 're hopeful that it 's going to continue , " marc garlasco , senior analyst at new york-based human rights watch , which has repeatedly criticized the military over the issue , told reuters . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rasmussen is set to take over as nato chief in august nato 's reputation in afghanistan suffered a further blow after the taliban called the incoming nato chief a " major enemy " of muslims for defending the publication of cartoons depicting the prophet mohammad when prime minister of denmark . anders fogh rasmussen , danish premier until earlier this month , is due in august to become secretary general of nato . the publication of the cartoons in a danish newspaper in 2006 led to riots across the muslim world , including bloody protests in afghanistan in which several people were killed .
rasmussen had defended the publication of the cartoons on the grounds of free speech and refused to apologize to muslim countries . us and nato commanders say insurgents are still responsible for the majority of civilian deaths , blaming a surge in violence on taliban fighting tactics . tw / sms , reuters / ap / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany undecided on attending un racism talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany and the european union are still debating whether they should attend a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "
political flip-flopping ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cdu 's ronald pofalla has few kind words about the spd even the greens , the spd 's preferred coalition partner , were critical of the manifesto .
" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .

" we have better answers than the others , " steinmeier told a cheering crowd of around 2,500 at a party conference in berlin on sunday , april 19 .
" i want to govern as chancellor , " he said .
steinmeier underpinned his claim to topple conservative chancellor angela merkel -lrb- cdu -rrb- by presenting his party 's manifesto , which calls for increased taxes on the rich , while cutting them for those less well-off .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- have pledged to boost the highest tax rate for people earning more than 125,000 euros -lrb- $ 163,000 -rrb- to 47 percent from 45 percent , and to cut the lowest rate to 10 percent from 14 percent .
" those with strong shoulders must now carry more weight in this crisis , " steinmeier said .
the proposed scheme also offers a 300-euro bonus for taxpayers who do not file a tax return to claim small rebates , a move that will cut red tape , according to the social democrats .
who 's to blame ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spd 's plan to grant a 300 euro bonus to small earners has been slammed by critics steinmeier also directed scathing criticism at those he said were responsible for the global financial crisis .
" something is smoldering in our country , " he said .
" anger and indignation are rife .
the people 's sense of justice has been violated . ”
the foreign minister blamed the casino-style action on the stock markets for the current crisis , adding that executives ' global hunt for maximal return had changed the foundations of society .
steinmeier also emphasized his party 's aim to defend the rights of employees and their jobs , including a realistic minimum wage with a benchmark of 7.50 euros .
he added that struggling german carmaker opel , which employs some 26,000 people in germany alone , had to be saved at all costs .
spd shifts left amid economic crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the financial crisis is likely to dominate the campaign trail with unemployment on the rise , the handling of the economic crisis is set to be a major battleground in the campaign and steinmeier 's comments as well as his party 's tax plans are aimed at boosting the party 's flagging popularity .
judging by the reaction of germany 's largest parties , however , the spd 's tax plans could reduce coalition options or at least seriously impede coalition negotiations following september 's election .
the leader of the pro-business free democrats -lrb- fdp -rrb- , germany 's biggest opposition party , said the spd plan effectively ruled out an alliance with his party .
" on this basis , there can be no collaboration , " said guido westerwelle .
raising taxes might go down well with the greens and the left party , he said , " but not with me . "

" what the spd is proposing today is the opposite of what they did during four years in the grand coalition .
so we have to ask them : ' are you really serious ? ' , " the greens said in a statement .
angela merkel 's conservatives - the spd 's senior partner in germany 's uneasy grand-coalition government - also attacked steinmeier 's proposals .
the general secretary of merkel 's cdu party , ronald pofalla , dubbed steinmeier " wobbly walter " and said that the spd " shift to the left is now a done deal . "
pofalla accused the spd of not only raising existing taxes but also of introducing new taxes .
" we want to cut taxes , " he pledged .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany undecided on attending un racism talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany and the european union are still debating whether they should attend a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany undecided on attending un racism talks großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany and the european union are still debating whether they should attend a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny or denigrate the holocaust . " sje / tt , afp / dpa / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de diplomacy -pipe- 19.04.2009 germany pulls out of un conference großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a growing boycott by western nations is undermining the un conference germany announced it is boycotting a controversial united nations anti-racism conference that begins in geneva on monday . the german foreign ministry said late sunday that berlin would join in boycotting a united nations conference on racism , set to start monday in geneva .
german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .
" we have argued for the concluding document to have sufficient -lrb- content -rrb- on the holocaust and combating anti-semitism . "
" we would find it unacceptable if the process seeks to deny the holocaust . " nrt / th / md , afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said the decision was made out of concern that the event would be " misused as a platform for ulterior interests , " as happened at a 2001 un anti-racism meeting in durban , south africa .
the five-day durban review conference is intended to take stock of international efforts to combat intolerance since the 2001 world conference against racism in durban , south africa , which saw the united states and israel walk out over claims of anti-semitism .
european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
the united states pulled out of the meeting on saturday because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
the netherlands , italy , new zealand , australia and canada also said they would not attend .
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier made the decision not to attend followed a conference call with his eu colleagues france warned monday that europeans would walk out of the event if ahmadinejad makes " anti-semitic accusations . "
" we will have to be very clear .
we will not tolerate any slips , " french foreign minister bernard kouchner told france info radio .
he warned ahmadinejad that " if he utters racist or anti-semitic accusations , we will leave the room immediately . "
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtail freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .
british confidence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : israel has slammed the un conference as a " tragic farce " britain , on the other hand , is expected to attend the geneva summit .
" we 're watching how things develop , " a foreign office spokesman told afp news agency .
" it 's still our intention to attend . "
the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .

the would-be hijackers were finally hunted down by the canadian frigate winnipeg , a nato maritime spokesman said . the pirates , who initially had weapons and what appeared to be climbing gear , threw all their gear overboard when the winnipeg finally caught up and stopped them .
nobody was injured in the incident . the pirates were detained and questioned , but subsequently released .
charging them with any offense would have fallen out of canada 's jurisdiction . earlier on saturday , dutch commandos freed 20 yemeni hostages and also briefly detained seven pirates who had forced the yemenis to sail a " mother ship " attacking vessels in the gulf of aden . belgian ship hijacked in a separate incident , gunmen from somalia seized a belgian ship and its 10 crew , including seven europeans , further south in the indian ocean .
the dredging vessel , the pompei , sent out two distress signals early on saturday when it was about 600 kilometers -lrb- 370 miles -rrb- from the somali coast .
a pirate source said the vessel would be taken to the coast . in brussels , government officials held an emergency meeting to discuss the situation and possible intervention . in recent months , somali sea gangs have hijacked dozens of ships and gleaned tens of millions of dollars -lrb- euros -rrb- in ransoms despite patrols by foreign navies off the horn of africa .
the attacks have disrupted un aid supplies , driven up insurance costs and forced some shipping companies to route cargo round south africa , rather than risk approaching somalia . nk / tt , ap / afp / reuters / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

european diplomats fear that this year 's conference may also take an aggressively anti-israeli , anti-western line given that preparations were dominated by libya , cuba and iran .
a draft declaration circulated earlier this year made israel responsible for the entire middle east conflict , while human rights violations in muslim countries were largely ignored .
differences persist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad has a history of denying the holocaust negotiators in geneva said on friday , april 17 , that most western and muslim states had agreed to a revised declaration that ironed out the most controversial issues linked to religious discrimination and the middle east .
but saturday saw the united states pull out of the meeting because of differences over israel and the right to free speech , while israel itself renewed its call for a boycott , describing the un conference as a " tragic farce . "
" officially , it is aimed at denouncing racism , but it has invited a holocaust denier who has called for the destruction of israel , " israeli foreign ministry spokesman yossi levy said .
levy 's remarks were a reference to iranian president mahmoud ahmadinejad , who is due to address the conference on april 20 , the anniversary of hitler 's birth .
the iranian leader , who is the only prominent head of state expected to attend the conference , has sparked international outrage by repeatedly calling the holocaust a " myth " and calling for israel to be wiped off the map .
last minute decisions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier is yet to decide whether germany will attend the un conference a spokesman for german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said no decision on german participation was likely to be made before sunday evening , and that the majority of european leaders were still discussing whether they should follow israel 's call to boycott the conference , which begins on monday .
the netherlands , however , broke ranks on sunday morning and announced it would not attend the event .
dutch foreign minister maxime verhagen said in a statement that countries with questionable human rights records were seeking to abuse the gathering " to place religion ahead of human rights and unnecessarily curtain freedom of speech , to negate discrimination against homosexuality , and to place israel alone in the accused bench " .
" the conference is too important for it to be abused for political ends and attacks on the west , " verhagen said .
" the netherlands will not be a party to that . "
the dutch decision follows much earlier boycott announcements issued by italy , canada and australia .

the spokesman said britain wanted the conference " to get a collective will to fight racism now , " although it was " under no illusions about the scale of this challenge . "
" we would n't be able to support a process that was skewed against the west or other countries , " the spokesman said , adding that britain had certain " red lines " on the issues involved that it would stick to .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spying scandal has already claimed the job of deutsche bahn chief hartmut mehdorn the announcement came in response to a report by the german weekly der spiegel , which claimed that deutsche bahn had not only - as previously assumed - monitored hundreds of thousands of emails of employees , but also secretly searched their computer hard drives . the existing spying quagmire was rendered even more treacherous by additional media reports linking the company 's monitoring activity to a parliamentarian of german chancellor angela merkel 's governing grand coalition .
according to the berliner tagesspiegel newspaper , transportation expert and member of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- uwe beckmeyer was on a blacklist of 30 deutsche bahn critics whose email correspondence with company employees had been screened since 2005 .
the company , however , adamantly rejected this specific allegation .
" there never was any surveillance of journalists or politicians or their employees , " the statement read .
mehdorn 's fall from grace embattled deutsche bahn chief executive hartmut mehdorn was forced to quit in march in the wake of mounting pressure over revelations the german state-owned rail operator had spied on staff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it is now up to ruediger grube to steer deutsche bahn through the spying crisis mehdorn claimed he was stepping down to avoid further damage to the company - germany 's largest with 230,000 employees .
he described the campaign to oust him as unprecedented and denied any wrongdoing .
mehdorn had already admitted in february that , as part of an anti-corruption campaign , deutsche bahn spied on 173,000 of its 220,000 employees in 2002 and 2003 .
official documents have since shown deutsche bahn screened its entire workforce again in 2005 for corruption .
the 66-year-old mehdorn had run deutsche bahn for nearly 10 years and won plaudits for turning it into a profitable global transport group ready for a stock market listing , but was heavily criticized for a confrontational approach to unions .
his hitherto unshaken support in berlin , however , started to crumble in earnest as the scope of the spying scandal began to emerge , and finally public and political pressure became too much for the seasoned manager .
germany 's transport ministry subsequently endorsed 57-year-old ruediger grube , a top executive at carmaker daimler , as the new head of the state-owned railways company . nk / tt , afp / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
