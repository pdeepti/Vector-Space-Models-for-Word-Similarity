but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .

unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , heidi is still riding the wave of her success . countless magazine covers , a hit television show , major modelling contracts and millions in the bank - top model heidi klum is indisputably one of germany 's most illustrious women .
but international stardom has n't always been without its drawbacks for the 34-year-old from bergisch gladbach .
recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you call this fat ?
and joop did n't stop there .
he further criticized klum in the tabloid magazine bunte , saying the buxom blond had no place in the world of high fashion .
" she 's not a top model , but rather a commercial model .
what model in high fashion has that permanent grin ?
but even without the grin , she still does n't have a nice mouth . "
not cut out for haute couture ?
german-born fashion designer karl lagerfeld also recently took a crack at klum for her commercial aura , telling a magazine she does n't exist to him .
" and she does n't exist in france , " he added .
but regardless of klum 's countenance and her questionable existence in france , " germany 's next top model " is a nationwide hit , scoring millions of viewers every week .
and klum 's success is n't just limited to the small screen .
she has also enjoyed a high-profile contract with us lingerie maker victoria 's secret for years .
the wife of british pop singer seal and mother of three , klum has also proven her foreign language skills and international appeal by hosting another television show , " project runway , " in the united states .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "

" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , heidi is still riding the wave of her success . countless magazine covers , a hit television show , major modelling contracts and millions in the bank - top model heidi klum is indisputably one of germany 's most illustrious women .
but international stardom has n't always been without its drawbacks for the 34-year-old from bergisch gladbach .
recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you call this fat ?
and joop did n't stop there .
he further criticized klum in the tabloid magazine bunte , saying the buxom blond had no place in the world of high fashion .
" she 's not a top model , but rather a commercial model .
what model in high fashion has that permanent grin ?
but even without the grin , she still does n't have a nice mouth . "
not cut out for haute couture ?
german-born fashion designer karl lagerfeld also recently took a crack at klum for her commercial aura , telling a magazine she does n't exist to him .
" and she does n't exist in france , " he added .
but regardless of klum 's countenance and her questionable existence in france , " germany 's next top model " is a nationwide hit , scoring millions of viewers every week .
and klum 's success is n't just limited to the small screen .
she has also enjoyed a high-profile contract with us lingerie maker victoria 's secret for years .
the wife of british pop singer seal and mother of three , klum has also proven her foreign language skills and international appeal by hosting another television show , " project runway , " in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klum helps make other model 's dream come true on her show with a booming career and a happy private life , is klum hurt by the criticism she 's received here in her native germany ?
" everyone is entitled to their opinion , " she told bunte magazine .
" so am i. "
the model also defended her figure , saying she is not the kind of person who diets .
" i was never a diet sort of person .
but when i started to model , i knew already that i would have to watch what i ate and stop eating wiener schnitzel , " she said . ls / kjb / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "

" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .

a total of three buildings then fell into the hole that opened up in the ground . police said kevin k had worked the night shift at a bakery located in the ground floor of the apartment block , and was apparently sleeping when the tragedy happened . rescuers were still searching sunday for another missing man , 24-year-old design student khalil g. , who lived in the same apartment building . " we 're working non-stop , removing rubble with excavating machinery and even with our bare hands , " said a spokesman for the city 's fire department . rescue teams were not able to begin searching for the missing men until friday because the ground was unsafe and other buildings nearby threatened to collapse . the rescue work was able to begin only after the structures were propped up and tons of concrete were poured into a huge hole to stabilize the site . one of germany greatest heritage losses the disaster is one of germany 's worst heritage losses since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse buried centuries of cultural heritage the archives , which had six levels above ground and two below , were described as the richest municipal record collection in northern continental europe , including decrees by emperors , lists of medieval residents and centuries of merchants ' records . also in the archives were the private papers of nobel literature prize laureate heinrich boell -lrb- 1917-1985 -rrb- and then-west germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , and original music by composer jacques offenbach .
the oldest item dated from 922 . trucks hauled away to safety those manuscripts that were not damaged because they were in an annex , while firemen used their bare hands to recover individual documents from the rubble . nda / kjb / th / tt / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , heidi is still riding the wave of her success . countless magazine covers , a hit television show , major modelling contracts and millions in the bank - top model heidi klum is indisputably one of germany 's most illustrious women .
but international stardom has n't always been without its drawbacks for the 34-year-old from bergisch gladbach .
recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you call this fat ?
and joop did n't stop there .
he further criticized klum in the tabloid magazine bunte , saying the buxom blond had no place in the world of high fashion .
" she 's not a top model , but rather a commercial model .
what model in high fashion has that permanent grin ?
but even without the grin , she still does n't have a nice mouth . "
not cut out for haute couture ?

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" so am i. "
the model also defended her figure , saying she is not the kind of person who diets .

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .

unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .

" he said he made , and the real ira made , no apology for targeting british soldiers while they remained what he called occupying the north of ireland , " suzanne breen , a journalist at the newspaper , told sky news on sunday , march 8 . the two soldiers were shot dead late on saturday , as the army base north of belfast took delivery of takeaway pizzas .
four other people , including two pizza delivery men , were seriously injured .
one is said to be in critical condition . the caller also claimed that the pizza delivery men were " collaborating with british rule " by serving british soldiers , breen was quoted by the irish times as saying . cowardly attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british authorities started a massive manhunt the governments in northern ireland , london and dublin have sharply condemned the shooting . " the whole country is shocked and outraged at the evil and cowardly attacks , " said british prime minister gordon brown .
" i can assure you that we will bring these people to justice . " " no murderer will be able to derail a peace process that has the support of the vast majority of the people of northern ireland and we will step up our efforts to make the peace process one that lasts and endures , " added brown . northern ireland 's first minister peter robinson has postponed a planned trip to the united states to respond to the tragedy . irish prime minister brian cowen said that " a tiny group of evil people can not and will not undermine the will of the people … to live in peace together . " attempt at mass murder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british army officially ended its mission in northern ireland in 2007 after 38 years gunmen reportedly entered the base as pizzas were delivered and fired up to 40 shots in two long bursts of gunfire . " i have no doubt in my mind that this was an attempt at mass murder , " said derek williamson , the investigating police officer . northern ireland 's police chief , sir hugh orde , had warned earlier this week that the threat from dissident republicans was at its highest in nearly a decade , amid reports that british special forces were back in the region to gather intelligence . saturday 's shooting is the first deadly attack on the british military in northern ireland since the signing of the good friday peace deal in 1998 . shadow cast on compromise government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican dissidents are suspected , though no one has claimed the attack concerns have been raised over the stability of the current power-sharing government , which unites former arch enemies across the protestant-catholic divide . " this has taken us back into bad , bad old days that we have long since left behind us , " thomas burns , a lawmaker with the nationalist sdlp told bbc television . more than 3,000 people were killed in the conflict between nationalist catholics and loyalist protestants in northern ireland , which began in the 1960s and continued for three decades .
the last british military death in the conflict was in 1997 and the good friday agreement was signed the following year . in 2007 , the mainly protestant democratic unionists , which want northern ireland to remain part of britain , and the catholic sinn fein , which supports integration into the republic of ireland , established the present power-sharing government , which has devolved power from london . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .
" the title is not my aim .
if we finish among the top five we 've had a very good season , " he said . tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "

" so am i. "
the model also defended her figure , saying she is not the kind of person who diets .
" i was never a diet sort of person .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "

" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .

according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .

spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .

hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .

" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "

unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .

instead , heidi is still riding the wave of her success . countless magazine covers , a hit television show , major modelling contracts and millions in the bank - top model heidi klum is indisputably one of germany 's most illustrious women .
but international stardom has n't always been without its drawbacks for the 34-year-old from bergisch gladbach .
recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you call this fat ?
and joop did n't stop there .
he further criticized klum in the tabloid magazine bunte , saying the buxom blond had no place in the world of high fashion .
" she 's not a top model , but rather a commercial model .
what model in high fashion has that permanent grin ?
but even without the grin , she still does n't have a nice mouth . "
not cut out for haute couture ?
german-born fashion designer karl lagerfeld also recently took a crack at klum for her commercial aura , telling a magazine she does n't exist to him .
" and she does n't exist in france , " he added .
but regardless of klum 's countenance and her questionable existence in france , " germany 's next top model " is a nationwide hit , scoring millions of viewers every week .
and klum 's success is n't just limited to the small screen .
she has also enjoyed a high-profile contract with us lingerie maker victoria 's secret for years .
the wife of british pop singer seal and mother of three , klum has also proven her foreign language skills and international appeal by hosting another television show , " project runway , " in the united states .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klum helps make other model 's dream come true on her show with a booming career and a happy private life , is klum hurt by the criticism she 's received here in her native germany ?
" everyone is entitled to their opinion , " she told bunte magazine .
" so am i. "
the model also defended her figure , saying she is not the kind of person who diets .
" i was never a diet sort of person .
but when i started to model , i knew already that i would have to watch what i ate and stop eating wiener schnitzel , " she said . ls / kjb / afp / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said he made , and the real ira made , no apology for targeting british soldiers while they remained what he called occupying the north of ireland , " suzanne breen , a journalist at the newspaper , told sky news on sunday , march 8 . the two soldiers were shot dead late on saturday , as the army base north of belfast took delivery of takeaway pizzas .

the last british military death in the conflict was in 1997 and the good friday agreement was signed the following year . in 2007 , the mainly protestant democratic unionists , which want northern ireland to remain part of britain , and the catholic sinn fein , which supports integration into the republic of ireland , established the present power-sharing government , which has devolved power from london . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?

the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .

deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "

" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

" we 're working non-stop , removing rubble with excavating machinery and even with our bare hands , " said a spokesman for the city 's fire department . rescue teams were not able to begin searching for the missing men until friday because the ground was unsafe and other buildings nearby threatened to collapse . the rescue work was able to begin only after the structures were propped up and tons of concrete were poured into a huge hole to stabilize the site . one of germany greatest heritage losses the disaster is one of germany 's worst heritage losses since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse buried centuries of cultural heritage the archives , which had six levels above ground and two below , were described as the richest municipal record collection in northern continental europe , including decrees by emperors , lists of medieval residents and centuries of merchants ' records . also in the archives were the private papers of nobel literature prize laureate heinrich boell -lrb- 1917-1985 -rrb- and then-west germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , and original music by composer jacques offenbach .
the oldest item dated from 922 . trucks hauled away to safety those manuscripts that were not damaged because they were in an annex , while firemen used their bare hands to recover individual documents from the rubble . nda / kjb / th / tt / dpa / ap send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

one is said to be in critical condition . the caller also claimed that the pizza delivery men were " collaborating with british rule " by serving british soldiers , breen was quoted by the irish times as saying . cowardly attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british authorities started a massive manhunt the governments in northern ireland , london and dublin have sharply condemned the shooting . " the whole country is shocked and outraged at the evil and cowardly attacks , " said british prime minister gordon brown .
" i can assure you that we will bring these people to justice . " " no murderer will be able to derail a peace process that has the support of the vast majority of the people of northern ireland and we will step up our efforts to make the peace process one that lasts and endures , " added brown . northern ireland 's first minister peter robinson has postponed a planned trip to the united states to respond to the tragedy . irish prime minister brian cowen said that " a tiny group of evil people can not and will not undermine the will of the people … to live in peace together . " attempt at mass murder bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british army officially ended its mission in northern ireland in 2007 after 38 years gunmen reportedly entered the base as pizzas were delivered and fired up to 40 shots in two long bursts of gunfire . " i have no doubt in my mind that this was an attempt at mass murder , " said derek williamson , the investigating police officer . northern ireland 's police chief , sir hugh orde , had warned earlier this week that the threat from dissident republicans was at its highest in nearly a decade , amid reports that british special forces were back in the region to gather intelligence . saturday 's shooting is the first deadly attack on the british military in northern ireland since the signing of the good friday peace deal in 1998 . shadow cast on compromise government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican dissidents are suspected , though no one has claimed the attack concerns have been raised over the stability of the current power-sharing government , which unites former arch enemies across the protestant-catholic divide . " this has taken us back into bad , bad old days that we have long since left behind us , " thomas burns , a lawmaker with the nationalist sdlp told bbc television . more than 3,000 people were killed in the conflict between nationalist catholics and loyalist protestants in northern ireland , which began in the 1960s and continued for three decades .
the last british military death in the conflict was in 1997 and the good friday agreement was signed the following year . in 2007 , the mainly protestant democratic unionists , which want northern ireland to remain part of britain , and the catholic sinn fein , which supports integration into the republic of ireland , established the present power-sharing government , which has devolved power from london . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" he said he made , and the real ira made , no apology for targeting british soldiers while they remained what he called occupying the north of ireland , " suzanne breen , a journalist at the newspaper , told sky news on sunday , march 8 . the two soldiers were shot dead late on saturday , as the army base north of belfast took delivery of takeaway pizzas .

" i have no doubt in my mind that this was an attempt at mass murder , " said derek williamson , the investigating police officer . northern ireland 's police chief , sir hugh orde , had warned earlier this week that the threat from dissident republicans was at its highest in nearly a decade , amid reports that british special forces were back in the region to gather intelligence . saturday 's shooting is the first deadly attack on the british military in northern ireland since the signing of the good friday peace deal in 1998 . shadow cast on compromise government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : republican dissidents are suspected , though no one has claimed the attack concerns have been raised over the stability of the current power-sharing government , which unites former arch enemies across the protestant-catholic divide .

the last british military death in the conflict was in 1997 and the good friday agreement was signed the following year . in 2007 , the mainly protestant democratic unionists , which want northern ireland to remain part of britain , and the catholic sinn fein , which supports integration into the republic of ireland , established the present power-sharing government , which has devolved power from london . kjb / tt / dpa / afp / reuters send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .
" the title is not my aim .
if we finish among the top five we 've had a very good season , " he said . tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we 're working non-stop , removing rubble with excavating machinery and even with our bare hands , " said a spokesman for the city 's fire department . rescue teams were not able to begin searching for the missing men until friday because the ground was unsafe and other buildings nearby threatened to collapse . the rescue work was able to begin only after the structures were propped up and tons of concrete were poured into a huge hole to stabilize the site . one of germany greatest heritage losses the disaster is one of germany 's worst heritage losses since world war ii . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the collapse buried centuries of cultural heritage the archives , which had six levels above ground and two below , were described as the richest municipal record collection in northern continental europe , including decrees by emperors , lists of medieval residents and centuries of merchants ' records . also in the archives were the private papers of nobel literature prize laureate heinrich boell -lrb- 1917-1985 -rrb- and then-west germany 's first chancellor , konrad adenauer , and original music by composer jacques offenbach .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .
" the title is not my aim .
if we finish among the top five we 've had a very good season , " he said . tt / dpa send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .

spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

" still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "

" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .

" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .

according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de women -pipe- 08.03.2009 equal rights still elusive for european women großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many european women are still discriminated against while women are increasingly reaching key positions in the world of european politics and business , they are still massively underrepresented and facing an uphill battle for recognition and equal pay . " still today in governments and parliaments , less than a quarter of members are women , " said margot wallstrom , the swedish vice-president of the european commission ahead of international women 's day on sunday , march 8 .
" there is no lack of female candidates , " she added .
" the reality is men tend to choose men . "
" one half of the population is seriously underrepresented " and , this being the case , " the policy agenda will be set by men , " wallstrom said during an eu parliamentary debate this week .
deep-seated prejudices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : very few women make it to the top despite a rise in the number of women candidates , male politicians stand a better chance of getting elected due to deep-seated prejudices and habits , a study by the european commission found .
according to data extrapolated from across the continent , an election with an equal number of male and female candidates would still result in a parliament with just 39 percent women representatives .
in other words , it would take 63 percent women candidates to achieve gender equilibrium in the final assembly .
" it 's wrong to blame women voters , " said drude dahlerup , a professor in the department of political science at stockholm university .
" the main problem is that male voters vote for male candidates . "
the iron lady was no feminist bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margaret thatcher did n't do much for women 's rights in the uk having a female prime minister , however , is no guarantee for a country that its policies will be women-friendly .
" margaret thatcher broke through the glass ceiling in politics , " said patricia hewitt , a minister under britain 's former labour prime minister tony blair .
" but it is a tragedy that , having become the uk 's first women prime minister , she did so much to undermine the position of women in society . "
according to the european commission study , none of the 27 eu member states ' lower chambers of parliament currently has half or more women deputies .
the closest is sweden with 46 percent women , followed by the netherlands and finland with 41 percent .
most chambers have less than a quarter of their seats occupied by women , with hungary -lrb- 10.9 percent -rrb- , romania -lrb- 10.1 percent -rrb- and malta -lrb- 8.7 percent -rrb- bringing up the rear .
the eu parliament comes in above average in the female representation stakes with 31.2 percent women mps .
women in the workplace bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more women in the workplace could be good for business officials say the presence of more women in the workplace could help lift the european union out of recession and mitigate the impact of future financial crises .
" discrimination produces inefficiency , " said european equals opportunity commissioner vladimir spidla earlier this week at the launch of a european campaign against the ongoing gender pay gap .
" and it is precisely during times of crisis that we should be most active . "
spidla quoted a series of studies showing that a more active participation by women in the workplace helps make businesses more efficient and avoid riskier investments .
one such study of 15,000 small- and medium-sized businesses in finland found that those run by women tend to be 10 percent more efficient than those run by men .
long-term perspective another recent french study showed that companies with more women on their board of directors tended to perform better on the stock exchange .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : studies have shown that women prefer to focus on long-term goals the study 's author , professor michel ferrary of the ceram business school in france , wrote in monday 's financial times that research has shown women to be more risk-averse and to focus more on the long-term perspective .
according to eu figures , only 30 percent of europe 's managers are women .
but this percentage drops to just 10 percent for large corporations .
worst still , women are paid on average 14.7 percent less than their male counterparts , even when doing exactly the same job .
and while the reasons for such a gender gap are numerous , it represents an intolerable source of discrimination on both moral and economic grounds , spidla said . tt / kjb / dpa / afp send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead , heidi is still riding the wave of her success . countless magazine covers , a hit television show , major modelling contracts and millions in the bank - top model heidi klum is indisputably one of germany 's most illustrious women .
but international stardom has n't always been without its drawbacks for the 34-year-old from bergisch gladbach .
recently she was bombarded with cutting remarks about her career and figure from fashion icon karl lagerfeld and german designer wolfgang joop .
when asked if klum would have a chance at winning on " germany 's next top model , " her own tv show in which aspiring models square off to be crowned the country 's next big thing , joop told german daily newspaper bild , " no way .
she 's not a runway model .
she 's simply too fat and even her breasts are too big . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : you call this fat ?
and joop did n't stop there .
he further criticized klum in the tabloid magazine bunte , saying the buxom blond had no place in the world of high fashion .

what model in high fashion has that permanent grin ?
but even without the grin , she still does n't have a nice mouth . "
not cut out for haute couture ?
german-born fashion designer karl lagerfeld also recently took a crack at klum for her commercial aura , telling a magazine she does n't exist to him .
" and she does n't exist in france , " he added .
but regardless of klum 's countenance and her questionable existence in france , " germany 's next top model " is a nationwide hit , scoring millions of viewers every week .
and klum 's success is n't just limited to the small screen .
she has also enjoyed a high-profile contract with us lingerie maker victoria 's secret for years .
the wife of british pop singer seal and mother of three , klum has also proven her foreign language skills and international appeal by hosting another television show , " project runway , " in the united states .

" everyone is entitled to their opinion , " she told bunte magazine .
" so am i. "
the model also defended her figure , saying she is not the kind of person who diets .

but lacklustre bayern are suddenly back in the game too . a hat-trick by on-loan striker andrey voronin in a 3-1 win at energie cottbus on saturday has put the berlin club four points clear at the top with 11 matches remaining .
yet hoeness and hertha are doing their best not to raise hopes in the german capital of a first title win for 78 years , decades before the bundesliga began in 1963 .
hertha are " a serious candidate for an international place , " hoeness conceded , meaning a top-five position and qualification for the uefa cup , which next season becomes the europa cup .
" we are seven points away from sixth place .
i do n't want to be a prophet of doom but things can go wrong quickly , " he said .
hertha 's swiss coach lucien favre is also refusing to get carried away by the club 's best bundesliga season to date .
" there is no reason to change our target of qualifying for the uefa cup .
we have won 3-1 but it could quite easily have been the other way round , " he said .
voronin 's the man bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will hertha manage to keep voronin ?
hertha can again thank on-form voronin , who has now scored seven goals in his last five games .
the ukrainian , on loan from liverpool , would like to make his move from the mersey to the spree a permanent one , but hertha could be facing competition for the striker .
" that danger is there but it does n't change our economic situation , " hoeness said .
" if we were manchester city we would n't wait -lrb- on signing voronin -rrb- .
andrey is doing everything right at the moment , the way he distributes the ball , helps relieve the team and scores .
he 's worth his weight in gold . "
while hertha remain coy on their title chances , bayern munich are back in business after a 5-1 thrashing of hanover .
after one win in five league games and a cup defeat to bayer leverkusen , the air was beginning to get thin for coach juergen klinsmann .
munich smiling again bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : uli hoeness , left , and juergen klinsmann still hope to win the title but there were smiles all round again in munich after bayern - -without suspended captain mark van bommel and the injured franck ribery , luca toni and tim borowski - recovered from the shock of conceding a goal to run out comfortable winners .
unlike dieter hoeness , older brother uli - bayern 's general manager - does not hesitate in talking about the championship .
" it 's now important that we steadily work our way up , " he said .
the all-time record champions and title-holders are now joint second with hoffenheim , level also on points with wolfsburg and sv hamburg .
" our goal is to win the league , and we wo n't let up now , " klinsmann said .
" hertha have pulled away at the top , and we need to reel them in .
we 'll redouble our efforts in that respect .
there are 11 games to go , and i reckon we have every chance of winning the league . "
hoffenheim lose steam bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hoffenheim fans must be disappointed with the team 's recent record promoted hoffenheim are meanwhile going off the boil with only one win in eight games , while hamburg 's 4-1 defeat at lowly borussia moenchengladbach underscored a lack of consistency away from home .
wolfsburg have meanwhile crept up among the leaders after their 1-0 defeat of karlsruhe was their fifth win in a row in the league .
yet coach felix magath , who won the league and cup double in successive seasons with bayern , does not see his side as a serious challenger .

five years ago i did not know much about africa .
my perception was like everyone else - the one you read in the media - a place of diseases , corruption , crime , poverty , wars , tribal fights .
i found africa as vibrant as china or india .
there is no lack of entrepreneurship there .
the private equity companies are there , the money is flowing , foreign direct investments are coming .
the consumer power speaks -lsb- for itself -rsb- .
the fact you have 300-450m people - divide that by five and you get 60-90 million households .
that is a lot of consumer power .
in my book , i looked at the people who are neither super rich nor super poor .
they are right in the middle .
i call them africa two .
here you have a group of anywhere from 300-450 million people in africa , who in my opinion are really going to drive the economy .
who are these people ?
they could be school teachers , nurses . working in the hospitality industry .
they are very positive .
they go to work , they are ambitious , they want things better than they had for their children .
they want education , better products ... they see africa going places .
their ambitions are not any different from those i had seen in other developing countries .
cheetah generation the second thing i discovered was how young the continent was .
more than 40 % of the population is less than 15 years old .
we call them the cheetah generation -lrb- the word used by a scholar from ghana -rrb- .
these kids do n't have the memory of the colonial days .
they are ambitious .
they have seen the beijing olympics .
they know many many things can be done .
they want the best things for themselves .
the growth of china and india are the best thing that has happened -lsb- for africa -rsb- .
when the chinese and indian companies started going to africa the rest of the world woke up .
how can these indian and chinese companies go to africa and do well ?
there really is an opportunity .
people realised that the market is not any different from what they know back home .
africa 's time has come .
africa 's entrepreneurs , africa 's media , africa 's leaders - they really need to take a proactive role and tell the rest of the world how much consumer power we have got .
i think the time has come . "
tune into the bbc world service to listen to the african perspective special on the power of africa 's private sector , on saturday 07 march at 2106 gmt .
the programme will be available for a week on the website .

the question is not will you invest in africa , but where in africa will you invest ?
the world is undergoing a cyclical downshift , and africa is part of that .
but separately , there is a structural growth that is still fundamentally running through the world .
once we emerge from the cyclical downturn , who are the players that will be best positioned to take advantage of structural growth ?
for the informed investor , africa has pockets of excellence .
if you look at some of the pioneering private funds , they closed last year with significant profits .
i found africa as vibrant as china or india .
there is no lack of entrepreneurship there can africa escape recession ?
as telecoms advances we will see the greater unlocking of the continent .
right now we have the laying of fibre down the east of the continent , which will unleash tremendous bandwidth , having applications for healthcare , education as well as infrastructure .
the potential to ' leapfrog ' is available in other areas like energy , like education , like agriculture .
stormy passage where should i invest ?
if one had to ask that question of hedge fund managers in the united states you would find many stretched for answers .
you want investments that weather the storm .
if there is difficulty internationally in where one can go for a flight to safety , then africa faces almost a double hurdle - a mist or angry cloud obfuscating opportunities that do exist .
the times we are in now - with a tremendous global headwind , if not a hurricane - call for a renewed dialogue between business government and civil society .

if there is difficulty internationally in where one can go for a flight to safety , then africa faces almost a double hurdle - a mist or angry cloud obfuscating opportunities that do exist .
the times we are in now - with a tremendous global headwind , if not a hurricane - call for a renewed dialogue between business government and civil society .
how can we as ' africa inc ' deal with the storm that approaches so that we prepare ourselves for the uptake ?
there is a lot of work left to be done .
vijay mahajan vijay mahajan was shocked by the vibrancy of private enterprise in africa vijay mahajan , is a professor of marketing at the university of texas , austin , usa , and the author of " africa rising " .
originally from india , he specialises in developing markets .
but until recently , like so many , he would not have considered africa as a place to do business .
five years ago i did not know much about africa .
my perception was like everyone else - the one you read in the media - a place of diseases , corruption , crime , poverty , wars , tribal fights .
i found africa as vibrant as china or india .
there is no lack of entrepreneurship there .
the private equity companies are there , the money is flowing , foreign direct investments are coming .
the consumer power speaks -lsb- for itself -rsb- .
the fact you have 300-450m people - divide that by five and you get 60-90 million households .
that is a lot of consumer power .
in my book , i looked at the people who are neither super rich nor super poor .
they are right in the middle .
i call them africa two .
here you have a group of anywhere from 300-450 million people in africa , who in my opinion are really going to drive the economy .
who are these people ?
they could be school teachers , nurses . working in the hospitality industry .
they are very positive .
they go to work , they are ambitious , they want things better than they had for their children .
they want education , better products ... they see africa going places .
their ambitions are not any different from those i had seen in other developing countries .
cheetah generation the second thing i discovered was how young the continent was .
more than 40 % of the population is less than 15 years old .
we call them the cheetah generation -lrb- the word used by a scholar from ghana -rrb- .
these kids do n't have the memory of the colonial days .
they are ambitious .
they have seen the beijing olympics .
they know many many things can be done .
they want the best things for themselves .
the growth of china and india are the best thing that has happened -lsb- for africa -rsb- .
when the chinese and indian companies started going to africa the rest of the world woke up .
how can these indian and chinese companies go to africa and do well ?
there really is an opportunity .
people realised that the market is not any different from what they know back home .
africa 's time has come .
africa 's entrepreneurs , africa 's media , africa 's leaders - they really need to take a proactive role and tell the rest of the world how much consumer power we have got .
i think the time has come .
tune into the bbc world service to listen to the african perspective special on the power of africa 's private sector , on saturday 07 march at 2106 gmt .
the programme will be available for a week on the website .
you can take part in a debate about business in africa on the tuesday 10 march edition of bbc africa have your say .

he stressed the need for labour values in these tough economic times , but warned delegates : " we need to be honest here in dundee and say what we all know - which is that we face testing times for our party and more importantly testing times for our country as well . "
mr miliband also stressed the need to " embrace nuclear power as part of our energy mix " and said coal could be a " fuel for the future not just a fuel for the past " .
the " green revolution " taking place across the world , he went on to say , could help create new jobs .
prime minister gordon brown was criticised over plans to part-privatise the royal mail by a union official .
john brown , scottish secretary of the communications workers union , reminded the conference the prime minister had told them privatisation and deregulation were not the answer to economic problems .
" why is the government legislating to privatise the royal mail , which will ultimately lead to the loss of tens of thousands of jobs across the uk , " asked mr brown .
work and pensions secretary james purnell warned labour of the need for party unity in the face of " turmoil " that lay ahead .
he told the conference : " amidst the turmoil we will face over the months ahead , we will have to answer a question as a country and a party - will we stick together and use our unity to build a better world than we had before , or will we let our fears force us apart ?
mr purnell went on to pledge labour would do all in its power to fight unemployment , and accused the tories of opposing spending an extra £ 2bn on helping those out of work .
labour msp jackie baillie is to bring a backbench bill to holyrood that would create an nhs " hospital superbug commissioner " .
health spokesman cathy jamieson , who announced the move during her conference speech , said the commissioner would be key to pulling together the various agencies responsible for fighting hospital infection .
the call came following the death of 18 patients at the vale of leven hospital in dunbartonshire , following an outbreak of clostridium difficile .
