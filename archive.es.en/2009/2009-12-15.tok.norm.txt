program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 15.12.2009 blurred bundeswehr mandate in afghanistan großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are calls for german defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg to resign over the kunduz attack the controversy over a deadly attack in kunduz that killed dozens of civilians continues to rage in germany .
for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .
the german parliament ’ s isaf mandate - renewed on 3 .
dec .
2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .
the german parliament ’ s isaf mandate - renewed on 3 .
dec .
2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .
the german parliament ’ s isaf mandate - renewed on 3 .
dec .
2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .

" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .

" people very seldom manage to get off of hartz iv , " the group wrote in its report , which is taking a look at the success of the program on its fifth anniversary .
the reform of the german labor market , which combined unemployment and social-assistance welfare , went into effect on january 1 , 2005 .
since then , iab has studying the effects of this change .
reassessing welfare reform ab director joachim moeller spoke of a " cautiously positive assessment of hartz iv , " saying overall the tendency was toward meeting the aims of the labor market reforms .
however , he said , there were still problems in dealing with the long-term unemployed .
according to the iab , the job-training schemes created so far are frequently not up to the task of solving the problem of long-term unemployment .
the famous " one-euro jobs " that were created to bring people back into the workplace should only be given to those who have been out of work for a long time , moeller said .
and single parents also need more assistance than they are currently getting - many fail to go back to work due to a lack of child care. jen / dpa / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "

" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .

the asylum seekers said they were on their way to strasbourg to air their grievances . polish border guards stopped 200 chechen and georgian refuguees from crossing the german border on tuesday .
the refugees borded a train to protest the poor conditions of the polish refugee camps where they live .
officials stopped the train at the polish city of zgorzelec because the refugees lacked the proper documents to leave poland , a spokeswoman for the border guards said .
the refugees had refused to dismount from the dresden-bound train for several hours earlier on tuesday before eventually disembarking peacefully .
the spokeswoman said the aim was to remove the refugees as quickly as possible as both pregnant women and small children were among their number .
the 200 protesters , members of a refugee asylum in the central polish town of radom , wanted to go to strasbourg to highlight what they described as poor living conditions and the slow processing of asylum applications in poland .
they were travelling without train tickets or travel papers according to the border guards .
refugee status in warsaw , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer defended poland 's treatment of refugees .
" we have accepted quite a big number of chechen refugees and poland 's refugee law is no different to that of other european countries when it comes to granting asylum or refugee status , " he told reuters .
" most probably the group of people in this train do not have refugee status and therefore can not travel around the eu .
that means polish authorities have to prevent the demonstration these people wanted to stage -lrb- in western europe -rrb- , " he added .
ewa piechota , spokeswoman for poland 's immigration office , denied the refugees were poorly treated , saying that poland guaranteed good conditions for refugees .
poland has taken in chechen refugees since the chechen wars fought between rebels and russia in the mid-1990s .
poles have traditionally been sympathetic to ethnic groups opposed to moscow 's rule. sjt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2009 negotiators at climate talks urged to step up pace as deadline looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from activists and leaders is mounting on negotiators for a deal the hosts of the un climate summit in copenhagen appealed for consensus amid concerns that crucial talks may be heading for failure .
on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .

while some believe it will make internet transactions more secure , others fear the information could be misused . the interior ministry has confirmed that the introduction of the multi-function card will go ahead as planned on november 1 , 2010 .
the information printed on the credit-card sized id will be encrypted digitally .
the radio chip also contains a digital passport photo .
enthusiastic advocate " i will be getting a new id card as soon as possible because it simply fits into my wallet a lot more easily , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere .
" it 's much smaller than the old one , but it can do a lot more , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german interior minister de maiziere ca n't wait to get his card for example , users can voluntarily choose to store two fingerprints , and to activate an electronic signature function .
the latter would allow them to sign sales contracts or make official applications online .
the card can also be used in machines , for example for age verification in cigarette vending machines .
restricted access but although the id can be used to fulfill both official and commercial functions , not everyone will have access to all of the data contained on the card .
owners have to enter a 6-digit pin number authorizing the release of information .
" citizens decide which data they want to transmit , " said interior ministry executive secretary hans bernhard beus . former interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for fingerprints to be made an obligatory feature of the new smart id cards , unleashing a storm of protest from data protectionists .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2009 negotiators at climate talks urged to step up pace as deadline looms großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pressure from activists and leaders is mounting on negotiators for a deal the hosts of the un climate summit in copenhagen appealed for consensus amid concerns that crucial talks may be heading for failure .
on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .

a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2009 germany 's new environment minister says copenhagen must succeed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert roettgen is acutely aware of the need for agreement in copenhagen norbert roettgen is currently attending climate talks in copenhagen .
in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

the arrests came amid warnings from the un that time for a climate change deal is running out . danish police arrested 210 demonstrators in the christiania squat in copenhagen , a refuge for hippies and artists since the 1970s .
police said the protesters had set alight barricades and some had thrown petrol bombs as officers tried to put out the fires .
large numbers of climate protesters had been at the squat for a party on monday night .
a witness told danish television that police had blocked all the exits from the refuge and had then fired tear gas .
earlier in the day , 17 people were arrested at a rally to highlight the plight of climate refugees .

the arrests follow the mass detention of about 900 protesters at the weekend during which danish police were accused of using heavy-handed measures .

before his departure from the un headquarters in new york , ban issued a warning that negotiators faced a race against time .
" i appeal to -lrb- negotiators -rrb- to redouble their efforts to find the room for compromise to make a final push in this final stretch , " ban said .
" if everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute , we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all , and this would be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequence , " he added .

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .

working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .
loss of protection ?
but mep sven giegold with the greens criticized the working conditions in latin america 's large-scale plantations .
human rights and environmental standards , he said , are often abused by these large multinational corporations .
" no , we 're not happy with it because our preference was always to maintain the tariff levels in order to provide some protection for small farmers , " giegold said .
the deal is likely to reduce prices for consumers in europe , increase competition in the banana market and strengthen the latin american position as low-cost exporters .
according to ecuadorian delegates at the talks , full signatures would take place about four months after the document was initialled on tuesday when all sides complete their respective national legislative processes. sjt / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

greece is a founder member of the eurozone , but its public finances have spiralled out of control in recent months , leading to fears of a default which could undermine the eu 's common currency .
deputy finance minister filippos sachinidis last week confirmed that the country was more than 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- in the red , telling the parliament in athens it was the largest public debt in the country 's history .
a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .
" a difficult situation in one euro-area member state is a matter of common concern for the euro area as a whole , " he said. rb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .

that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .

he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .

" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .

a witness told danish television that police had blocked all the exits from the refuge and had then fired tear gas .
earlier in the day , 17 people were arrested at a rally to highlight the plight of climate refugees .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2009 germany 's new environment minister says copenhagen must succeed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert roettgen is acutely aware of the need for agreement in copenhagen norbert roettgen is currently attending climate talks in copenhagen .
in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 15.12.2009 poster designers added color to eastern europe 's velvet revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing on the wall at prague 's wenceslas square in 1989 two decades have passed since czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution .
the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .

but the european union and the us have refused to recognize the breakaway region ’ s election . the united states and the european union have refused recognition of election results recently released in the breakaway caucasus region of abkhazia .
the us state department said it did not recognize the legality of the result , which saw separatist leader sergei bagapsh win re-election in the region 's first vote since it declared independence from georgia following tbilisi 's brief war with russia in august last year .
" the united states regrets the decision to hold ' elections ' in the abkhazia region of georgia on december 12 and recognizes neither the legality nor the results , " state department spokesman ian kelly said in a statement .
" the united states reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders , " kelly said .

the final results are expected to be released later this week , though khajimba told the afp news agency he would contest them .

" i appeal to -lrb- negotiators -rrb- to redouble their efforts to find the room for compromise to make a final push in this final stretch , " ban said .
" if everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute , we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all , and this would be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequence , " he added .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.12.2009 german airlines call for independent regulator to set airport fees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german airports can charge what they want for their services the ongoing tussle between airlines and airports over fees came to a head last week when frankfurt airport announced a 12.5 percent price hike .
now the airlines are renewing calls for an independent regulator . against the background of an increasingly competitive airline industry , with both airlines and airports reporting a tough 2009 , the ongoing conflict over airport fees has become all too understandable .
airlines pay airports set fees for landing and taxiing their planes , and they are becoming increasingly disgruntled at being a captive customer .
last week the company that operates frankfurt airport , fraport , ignited fresh indignation by announcing it would raise fees by 12.5 percent .
mini monopolies now the german airline association -lrb- bdf -rrb- has called on the federal government to show some solomonic wisdom and create an independent federal regulator to arbitrate airport fees and to force airports to make savings where they can .
the bdf sees this as a necessary modernizing measure given the way the air travel business has evolved in the past 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has just announced a price hike " in the face of the critical economic situation it has become very important for airlines that their partners - those also involved in the air transport system - are positioned according to competitive criteria , " bdf spokeswoman sabine teller told deutsche welle .
" at the moment , every airport sets its own fees , and from our point of view that is a monopoly , " she said .
" the airports do nothing to keep the costs down , while airlines are under pressure to keep their prices as cheap as possible in order to get as many passengers as possible . "
the bdf also points to what it considers an absurdity in the current system in germany .
despite being by definition the most global of businesses , airlines in germany must go to regional state governments to have their airport fees regulated .
in almost all cases , the state governments actually own the airports .
" they therefore have an interest in raising profits from the airports .
that is a conflict of interests , " said teller .
a new federal network agency in the bdf 's vision , the proposed independent body would perform the same function as the german federal network agency does for the electricity , gas , telecommunications , postal and railway sectors - liberalizing the market to ensure competition .
" the comparison with railways is actually quite valid , " teller said .
" the rails and the railway stations belong to deutsche bahn , and they take a fee from railway companies to use them .
in this case , the federal network agency decides the extent of the fee . "
but the airports do not agree with this comparison .
" we do n't see airports as a business that can or should be deregulated like this . "
heike van hoorn , spokeswoman for the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" if you take the comparison of energy companies , for example - they operate power stations and the electricity network , " she said . "
in the air travel industry , it 's completely different .
we do n't have this monopoly situation .
the airports represent a point infrastructure , but the networks themselves are run by the airlines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparisons have been made with the railway industry on top of this , van hoorn was eager to point out that the adv alone represents 45 different airports .
" this is not a monopoly situation , " she said .
van hoorn argued that the current situation , whereby each airport 's fees are decided individually under the jurisdiction of the state government , has proven its efficiency .
" each airport plays an individual role in its local area , and state governments are much nearer , " she says .
political opportunity the bdf has timed its demand for an independent regulator with a certain political expediency .
the european union recently issued a new directive for airport fees , which member states must bring into effect within the next two years .
for the bdf , this is an ideal opportunity for reform .
" the eu airport fee directive expressly allows such a reform , " bdf boss michael engel said in a statement .
" and it would incidentally also bring clear advantages for state governments . "
according to the bdf , the savings would not only be financial , but also bureaucratic .
each application for permission to use an airport has to be processed individually - a task engel said some state governments were not able to complete efficiently .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .

he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "

" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "

" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .
the melting glaciers in the himalayas , the more severe and frequent monsoon rains and rising sea-levels are all causing his homeland more and more damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless family tries to build a temporary hut with coconut leaves the coast is being affected , as well .
tropical storms and cyclones are increasing in number and strength .
many parts of bangladesh are only just above sea level , so most areas offer no natural protection against meter-high tidal waves and winds of up to 300 km per hour . akteruzzaman khan carries the heavy memory of the cyclone of 1991 .
it cost more than 140,000 people their lives .
the young man from the south-eastern island of dolghata lost 26 members of his family .
a quarter of the islanders were killed .
not one house was left unscathed , only a few palm trees remained untouched . " perhaps mother nature is out of kilter , " he said .

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .
he and a group of friends have planted 70,000 saplings in an area just north of the capital .
when the rainy season starts , the trees will be transplanted onto the dry dam embankments . the trees will form a natural barrier to stop the earth and debris sliding into the dam and blocking the power generators .
the state electricity board has agreed to provide fencing to protect the plantations .
it 's a smart step towards self-help in a country whose economy is two-thirds subsidized by foreign aid . at the beginning of the twentieth century , 40 percent of ethiopia was woodland .
but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .
newly planted seeds are washed away . " this can lead to the devastation of whole swathes of land , as it happened in the north for example , " said mekonen ayana from arba-minch university . water storage in ethiopia , environmentalism is largely a political matter . " it 's about irrigation projects and street building , land rights for farmers and forced re-settlement , " said argaw ashine , who heads an environmental radio project run by the german heinrich boell foundation .
" it is about multi-million pound aid programs and it 's about corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only six percent of the country has access to fresh water for the courageous 25-year-old , the country 's democratization process is happening too slowly .
he said it is obvious that the lack of environmental awareness is directly linked to poverty and educational deficits .
a free media that might help to create awareness does not exist . " development is good , but modern development has to take the environment into account to truly be sustainable , " said the head of the ethiopian environmental protection agency .
it 's a sound argument - except that only six percent of the country receives any water at all .
a working water storage system is not sufficiently developed , even at its source , the blue nile .
there is hardly any infrastructure in place to implement water-saving mechanisms . tadese has chosen to help himself .
the government has leased him half an acre of land east of addis ababa .
he channels water onto his avocado plants using a contraption made from plastic bottles .
he also grows guavas , lemon , apples and corn .
on one of his small meadows , he even has cows grazing .
the farmer proudly pulls up water from a well using an old tin bucket . " i have n't known drought yet , but i am prepared , " he said . authors : haile amlak kassaye / peter zimmermann editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .

but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .
he and a group of friends have planted 70,000 saplings in an area just north of the capital .
when the rainy season starts , the trees will be transplanted onto the dry dam embankments . the trees will form a natural barrier to stop the earth and debris sliding into the dam and blocking the power generators .
the state electricity board has agreed to provide fencing to protect the plantations .
it 's a smart step towards self-help in a country whose economy is two-thirds subsidized by foreign aid . at the beginning of the twentieth century , 40 percent of ethiopia was woodland .
but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .
newly planted seeds are washed away . " this can lead to the devastation of whole swathes of land , as it happened in the north for example , " said mekonen ayana from arba-minch university . water storage in ethiopia , environmentalism is largely a political matter . " it 's about irrigation projects and street building , land rights for farmers and forced re-settlement , " said argaw ashine , who heads an environmental radio project run by the german heinrich boell foundation .
" it is about multi-million pound aid programs and it 's about corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only six percent of the country has access to fresh water for the courageous 25-year-old , the country 's democratization process is happening too slowly .
he said it is obvious that the lack of environmental awareness is directly linked to poverty and educational deficits .
a free media that might help to create awareness does not exist . " development is good , but modern development has to take the environment into account to truly be sustainable , " said the head of the ethiopian environmental protection agency .
it 's a sound argument - except that only six percent of the country receives any water at all .
a working water storage system is not sufficiently developed , even at its source , the blue nile .
there is hardly any infrastructure in place to implement water-saving mechanisms . tadese has chosen to help himself .
the government has leased him half an acre of land east of addis ababa .
he channels water onto his avocado plants using a contraption made from plastic bottles .
he also grows guavas , lemon , apples and corn .
on one of his small meadows , he even has cows grazing .
the farmer proudly pulls up water from a well using an old tin bucket . " i have n't known drought yet , but i am prepared , " he said . authors : haile amlak kassaye / peter zimmermann editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .

they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .
the melting glaciers in the himalayas , the more severe and frequent monsoon rains and rising sea-levels are all causing his homeland more and more damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless family tries to build a temporary hut with coconut leaves the coast is being affected , as well .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .

sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .

deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .
the german parliament ’ s isaf mandate - renewed on 3 .
dec .
2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 15.12.2009 eu banana dispute ends in favor of latin american exporters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the 16-year banana dispute could mean cheaper bananas for europeans bananas will likely be a few cents cheaper for european shoppers as a result of the settlement of the ' banana war ' between latin american banana exporters and the eu . the longest trade dispute between the european union and latin american countries at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- was settled on tuesday .
since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .
loss of protection ?
but mep sven giegold with the greens criticized the working conditions in latin america 's large-scale plantations .
human rights and environmental standards , he said , are often abused by these large multinational corporations .
" no , we 're not happy with it because our preference was always to maintain the tariff levels in order to provide some protection for small farmers , " giegold said .
the deal is likely to reduce prices for consumers in europe , increase competition in the banana market and strengthen the latin american position as low-cost exporters .
according to ecuadorian delegates at the talks , full signatures would take place about four months after the document was initialled on tuesday when all sides complete their respective national legislative processes. sjt / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .
the melting glaciers in the himalayas , the more severe and frequent monsoon rains and rising sea-levels are all causing his homeland more and more damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless family tries to build a temporary hut with coconut leaves the coast is being affected , as well .
tropical storms and cyclones are increasing in number and strength .
many parts of bangladesh are only just above sea level , so most areas offer no natural protection against meter-high tidal waves and winds of up to 300 km per hour . akteruzzaman khan carries the heavy memory of the cyclone of 1991 .
it cost more than 140,000 people their lives .
the young man from the south-eastern island of dolghata lost 26 members of his family .
a quarter of the islanders were killed .
not one house was left unscathed , only a few palm trees remained untouched . " perhaps mother nature is out of kilter , " he said .

but it is also well known for its susceptibility to natural disasters .
every year , cyclones tear through the island . nosy varika lies on the south-east coast of madagascar , cut off from the rest of the island .
radio communication is the only contact the inhabitants have with the outside world .
there are no telephones and no communications networks .
even in the dry season , the area is difficult to reach and jeeps struggle on the potholed dirt tracks that have never seen a stroke of tarmac . in the rainy season , it is not even worth trying to get through .
the locals use the waterways to get around , travelling along the pangalanes canal in boats or in traditional pirogue canoes . along with the north of the island and the entire east coast , nosy varika is hit by cyclones nearly every year .
they are a matter of course ; only the names change every time : grettelle , indlala , jaya or dina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine in madagascar mostly affects children in january 2007 , the island was hit by cyclone clovis .
the material damage was enormous : roads , bridges and houses were destroyed , fields were laid to waste and the annual harvest was destroyed .
the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .
they need to be able to protect themselves and have to deal with the after-effects .
the list of preventative measures is a long one : catastrophe committees , better communications infrastructures , early-warning systems and storage facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international aid agencies have a lot of convincing to do didier young , coordinator of the madagascan catastrophe aid for care international , said he supports the introduction of new rice varieties that ripen faster and can therefore be harvested up to two months before the cyclone season begins .
as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .
people who live in poverty generally have little incentive or time to worry about the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation increases devastation , such as flooding and landslides the average annual income of a madagascan is around 250 dollars .
according to the un , the island is one of the poorest and least developed in the world .
illegal lumbering and deforestation is a way for the islanders to survive ; the wood is used for cooking and heating . acute deforestation is now visible all over the island .
it increases the devastation caused by cyclones such as flooding , landslides and the aggradation of rice paddies .
without the forest 's natural barriers , the sand and debris flows into the irrigation channels and blocks them , topsoil from the fields is swept away , leaving them useless for growing .
when the wet season 's heavy rainfall comes , there is nothing to stop the water from flooding the valleys . author : barbara gruber editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .
the melting glaciers in the himalayas , the more severe and frequent monsoon rains and rising sea-levels are all causing his homeland more and more damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless family tries to build a temporary hut with coconut leaves the coast is being affected , as well .
tropical storms and cyclones are increasing in number and strength .
many parts of bangladesh are only just above sea level , so most areas offer no natural protection against meter-high tidal waves and winds of up to 300 km per hour . akteruzzaman khan carries the heavy memory of the cyclone of 1991 .
it cost more than 140,000 people their lives .
the young man from the south-eastern island of dolghata lost 26 members of his family .
a quarter of the islanders were killed .
not one house was left unscathed , only a few palm trees remained untouched . " perhaps mother nature is out of kilter , " he said .
" lately we have been getting three to four cyclone warnings a year .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "

ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .

human rights and environmental standards , he said , are often abused by these large multinational corporations .
" no , we 're not happy with it because our preference was always to maintain the tariff levels in order to provide some protection for small farmers , " giegold said .
the deal is likely to reduce prices for consumers in europe , increase competition in the banana market and strengthen the latin american position as low-cost exporters .

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .

the refugees borded a train to protest the poor conditions of the polish refugee camps where they live .
officials stopped the train at the polish city of zgorzelec because the refugees lacked the proper documents to leave poland , a spokeswoman for the border guards said .
the refugees had refused to dismount from the dresden-bound train for several hours earlier on tuesday before eventually disembarking peacefully .
the spokeswoman said the aim was to remove the refugees as quickly as possible as both pregnant women and small children were among their number .
the 200 protesters , members of a refugee asylum in the central polish town of radom , wanted to go to strasbourg to highlight what they described as poor living conditions and the slow processing of asylum applications in poland .
they were travelling without train tickets or travel papers according to the border guards .

" we have accepted quite a big number of chechen refugees and poland 's refugee law is no different to that of other european countries when it comes to granting asylum or refugee status , " he told reuters .
" most probably the group of people in this train do not have refugee status and therefore can not travel around the eu .
that means polish authorities have to prevent the demonstration these people wanted to stage -lrb- in western europe -rrb- , " he added .

the asylum seekers said they were on their way to strasbourg to air their grievances . polish border guards stopped 200 chechen and georgian refuguees from crossing the german border on tuesday .
the refugees borded a train to protest the poor conditions of the polish refugee camps where they live .
officials stopped the train at the polish city of zgorzelec because the refugees lacked the proper documents to leave poland , a spokeswoman for the border guards said .
the refugees had refused to dismount from the dresden-bound train for several hours earlier on tuesday before eventually disembarking peacefully .
the spokeswoman said the aim was to remove the refugees as quickly as possible as both pregnant women and small children were among their number .
the 200 protesters , members of a refugee asylum in the central polish town of radom , wanted to go to strasbourg to highlight what they described as poor living conditions and the slow processing of asylum applications in poland .
they were travelling without train tickets or travel papers according to the border guards .
refugee status in warsaw , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer defended poland 's treatment of refugees .
" we have accepted quite a big number of chechen refugees and poland 's refugee law is no different to that of other european countries when it comes to granting asylum or refugee status , " he told reuters .
" most probably the group of people in this train do not have refugee status and therefore can not travel around the eu .
that means polish authorities have to prevent the demonstration these people wanted to stage -lrb- in western europe -rrb- , " he added .
ewa piechota , spokeswoman for poland 's immigration office , denied the refugees were poorly treated , saying that poland guaranteed good conditions for refugees .
poland has taken in chechen refugees since the chechen wars fought between rebels and russia in the mid-1990s .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .

the asylum seekers said they were on their way to strasbourg to air their grievances . polish border guards stopped 200 chechen and georgian refuguees from crossing the german border on tuesday .
the refugees borded a train to protest the poor conditions of the polish refugee camps where they live .
officials stopped the train at the polish city of zgorzelec because the refugees lacked the proper documents to leave poland , a spokeswoman for the border guards said .
the refugees had refused to dismount from the dresden-bound train for several hours earlier on tuesday before eventually disembarking peacefully .
the spokeswoman said the aim was to remove the refugees as quickly as possible as both pregnant women and small children were among their number .
the 200 protesters , members of a refugee asylum in the central polish town of radom , wanted to go to strasbourg to highlight what they described as poor living conditions and the slow processing of asylum applications in poland .
they were travelling without train tickets or travel papers according to the border guards .
refugee status in warsaw , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer defended poland 's treatment of refugees .
" we have accepted quite a big number of chechen refugees and poland 's refugee law is no different to that of other european countries when it comes to granting asylum or refugee status , " he told reuters .
" most probably the group of people in this train do not have refugee status and therefore can not travel around the eu .
that means polish authorities have to prevent the demonstration these people wanted to stage -lrb- in western europe -rrb- , " he added .
ewa piechota , spokeswoman for poland 's immigration office , denied the refugees were poorly treated , saying that poland guaranteed good conditions for refugees .
poland has taken in chechen refugees since the chechen wars fought between rebels and russia in the mid-1990s .
poles have traditionally been sympathetic to ethnic groups opposed to moscow 's rule. sjt / dpa / reuters / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said .

" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .
loss of protection ?
but mep sven giegold with the greens criticized the working conditions in latin america 's large-scale plantations .
human rights and environmental standards , he said , are often abused by these large multinational corporations .
" no , we 're not happy with it because our preference was always to maintain the tariff levels in order to provide some protection for small farmers , " giegold said .
the deal is likely to reduce prices for consumers in europe , increase competition in the banana market and strengthen the latin american position as low-cost exporters .
according to ecuadorian delegates at the talks , full signatures would take place about four months after the document was initialled on tuesday when all sides complete their respective national legislative processes. sjt / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the asylum seekers said they were on their way to strasbourg to air their grievances . polish border guards stopped 200 chechen and georgian refuguees from crossing the german border on tuesday .
the refugees borded a train to protest the poor conditions of the polish refugee camps where they live .
officials stopped the train at the polish city of zgorzelec because the refugees lacked the proper documents to leave poland , a spokeswoman for the border guards said .
the refugees had refused to dismount from the dresden-bound train for several hours earlier on tuesday before eventually disembarking peacefully .
the spokeswoman said the aim was to remove the refugees as quickly as possible as both pregnant women and small children were among their number .
the 200 protesters , members of a refugee asylum in the central polish town of radom , wanted to go to strasbourg to highlight what they described as poor living conditions and the slow processing of asylum applications in poland .
they were travelling without train tickets or travel papers according to the border guards .
refugee status in warsaw , deputy foreign minister andrzej kremer defended poland 's treatment of refugees .
" we have accepted quite a big number of chechen refugees and poland 's refugee law is no different to that of other european countries when it comes to granting asylum or refugee status , " he told reuters .
" most probably the group of people in this train do not have refugee status and therefore can not travel around the eu .
that means polish authorities have to prevent the demonstration these people wanted to stage -lrb- in western europe -rrb- , " he added .
ewa piechota , spokeswoman for poland 's immigration office , denied the refugees were poorly treated , saying that poland guaranteed good conditions for refugees .
poland has taken in chechen refugees since the chechen wars fought between rebels and russia in the mid-1990s .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .

working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .

others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .

2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .
united nations resolutions , nato decisions and agreements with the afghan government decide what isaf troops are allowed to do in afghanistan .
the german parliament ’ s isaf mandate - renewed on 3 .
dec .
2009 - describes the bundeswehr ’ s task as “ maintaining security ” and allows it explicitly to use force to do so .
sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

tropical storms and heavy floods destroy the belongings of many .
having lost everything , people are forced to rebuild their lives from scratch . the riverbed is almost dry at low tide on the jamuna , one of bangladesh 's largest rivers .
where there is usually a mighty stream , the jamuna is only a knee-deep rivulet .
the local farmers take advantage of the dry season to plant their crops .
it is three or four months before the harvest , and it is also three or four months before the monsoon season .
once it starts to rain , the river rises until it obliterates the opposite riverbank . that is when the nightmare begins for jamila and surfan begum , who are among the 600,000 bangladeshis living on wet land islands or river bars formed from a build-up of sediment in the river . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : people have to wade through flooded streets to collect food " i was absolutely terrified , " said jamila , a resolute woman in her mid-thirties who comes from near the gaibandha district .
" the water just kept on rising .
i did n't know what to do , where i should run to . " surfan , like jamila , lost everything in the 2007 flooding .
her harvest was destroyed and her livestock washed away . " my hens and goats , even my dog - the river took everything , " surfan said .
" we have nothing left .
how are we supposed to survive ? " floods not the only threat there is a local proverb , which says : people do n't die in the floods .
they die when there are no floods . bangladesh 's rural community relies on a degree of " normal " flooding to bring in moisture and fresh sediment .
they have also adapted their lifestyle to live with river flooding : frequently moving their temporary bank side homes , planting on newly emerging riverbanks and sometimes raising their houses above river level .
two of their rice varieties can not survive without flood water . bildunterschrift : some families take refuge inside their damaged houses but recently , the jamuna has been flooding more frequently and more severely .
the people here , though , are only equipped to deal with one flood a year . " this year , the water came twice , " said local fisherman abu taleb .
" the people here did n't have a chance to cultivate anything . " the result of abnormal flooding is devastating .
the areas worst hit already belong to some of the poorest in bangladesh .
each time a natural catastrophe hits , they just get poorer . small steps against the catastrophe around half of bangladesh 's population suffers from severe malnutrition . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cyclone sidr made thousands homeless " it 's a catch 22 , " said habibur rahman chowdhury from the german aid agency net .
" every time there is a natural catastrophe and people have to rebuild their lives from scratch , every time they have to start all over again , so the poverty levels in the area worsen .
the people do n't have anything left to fight the floods with . " net helps the flood victims using simple responses .
for one , they build up the islands higher , at least as high as the most recent flood water levels . is climate change to blame ? chowdhury is convinced that climate change is directly affecting bangladesh .
the melting glaciers in the himalayas , the more severe and frequent monsoon rains and rising sea-levels are all causing his homeland more and more damage . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a homeless family tries to build a temporary hut with coconut leaves the coast is being affected , as well .
tropical storms and cyclones are increasing in number and strength .
many parts of bangladesh are only just above sea level , so most areas offer no natural protection against meter-high tidal waves and winds of up to 300 km per hour . akteruzzaman khan carries the heavy memory of the cyclone of 1991 .
it cost more than 140,000 people their lives .
the young man from the south-eastern island of dolghata lost 26 members of his family .
a quarter of the islanders were killed .
not one house was left unscathed , only a few palm trees remained untouched . " perhaps mother nature is out of kilter , " he said .
" lately we have been getting three to four cyclone warnings a year . " author : peter koppen editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

radio communication is the only contact the inhabitants have with the outside world .
there are no telephones and no communications networks .
even in the dry season , the area is difficult to reach and jeeps struggle on the potholed dirt tracks that have never seen a stroke of tarmac . in the rainy season , it is not even worth trying to get through .
the locals use the waterways to get around , travelling along the pangalanes canal in boats or in traditional pirogue canoes . along with the north of the island and the entire east coast , nosy varika is hit by cyclones nearly every year .

the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .

as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .

every year , cyclones tear through the island . nosy varika lies on the south-east coast of madagascar , cut off from the rest of the island .
radio communication is the only contact the inhabitants have with the outside world .
there are no telephones and no communications networks .
even in the dry season , the area is difficult to reach and jeeps struggle on the potholed dirt tracks that have never seen a stroke of tarmac . in the rainy season , it is not even worth trying to get through .
the locals use the waterways to get around , travelling along the pangalanes canal in boats or in traditional pirogue canoes . along with the north of the island and the entire east coast , nosy varika is hit by cyclones nearly every year .
they are a matter of course ; only the names change every time : grettelle , indlala , jaya or dina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine in madagascar mostly affects children in january 2007 , the island was hit by cyclone clovis .
the material damage was enormous : roads , bridges and houses were destroyed , fields were laid to waste and the annual harvest was destroyed .
the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .
they need to be able to protect themselves and have to deal with the after-effects .
the list of preventative measures is a long one : catastrophe committees , better communications infrastructures , early-warning systems and storage facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international aid agencies have a lot of convincing to do didier young , coordinator of the madagascan catastrophe aid for care international , said he supports the introduction of new rice varieties that ripen faster and can therefore be harvested up to two months before the cyclone season begins .
as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .
people who live in poverty generally have little incentive or time to worry about the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation increases devastation , such as flooding and landslides the average annual income of a madagascan is around 250 dollars .
according to the un , the island is one of the poorest and least developed in the world .
illegal lumbering and deforestation is a way for the islanders to survive ; the wood is used for cooking and heating . acute deforestation is now visible all over the island .
it increases the devastation caused by cyclones such as flooding , landslides and the aggradation of rice paddies .
without the forest 's natural barriers , the sand and debris flows into the irrigation channels and blocks them , topsoil from the fields is swept away , leaving them useless for growing .
when the wet season 's heavy rainfall comes , there is nothing to stop the water from flooding the valleys . author : barbara gruber editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .

the costs - 15.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- - were up 4 percent from 2007 .
the largest group to use the assistance comprises the handicapped , those in need of home medical care , and the elderly .
a look at hartz-iv in contrast to social assistance payments , welfare aid for those who are long-term unemployed is provided under germany 's hartz-iv unemployment package .
the hartz-iv system went into effect five years ago .
now , a study published on tuesday by the nuremberg-based institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- has shown that few people who get onto the hartz iv scheme are able to get off it again .
they often fail to return to a normal work life .
" people very seldom manage to get off of hartz iv , " the group wrote in its report , which is taking a look at the success of the program on its fifth anniversary .
the reform of the german labor market , which combined unemployment and social-assistance welfare , went into effect on january 1 , 2005 .
since then , iab has studying the effects of this change .
reassessing welfare reform ab director joachim moeller spoke of a " cautiously positive assessment of hartz iv , " saying overall the tendency was toward meeting the aims of the labor market reforms .
however , he said , there were still problems in dealing with the long-term unemployed .
according to the iab , the job-training schemes created so far are frequently not up to the task of solving the problem of long-term unemployment .
the famous " one-euro jobs " that were created to bring people back into the workplace should only be given to those who have been out of work for a long time , moeller said .
and single parents also need more assistance than they are currently getting - many fail to go back to work due to a lack of child care. jen / dpa / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some believe it will make internet transactions more secure , others fear the information could be misused . the interior ministry has confirmed that the introduction of the multi-function card will go ahead as planned on november 1 , 2010 .
the information printed on the credit-card sized id will be encrypted digitally .
the radio chip also contains a digital passport photo .
enthusiastic advocate " i will be getting a new id card as soon as possible because it simply fits into my wallet a lot more easily , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere .
" it 's much smaller than the old one , but it can do a lot more , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new german interior minister de maiziere ca n't wait to get his card for example , users can voluntarily choose to store two fingerprints , and to activate an electronic signature function .
the latter would allow them to sign sales contracts or make official applications online .
the card can also be used in machines , for example for age verification in cigarette vending machines .
restricted access but although the id can be used to fulfill both official and commercial functions , not everyone will have access to all of the data contained on the card .
owners have to enter a 6-digit pin number authorizing the release of information .
" citizens decide which data they want to transmit , " said interior ministry executive secretary hans bernhard beus . former interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for fingerprints to be made an obligatory feature of the new smart id cards , unleashing a storm of protest from data protectionists .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

" the united states reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders , " kelly said .
in a similar attack on the poll 's legitimacy , the european union said it " does not recognize the constitutional and legal framework within which these elections have taken place .

the final results are expected to be released later this week , though khajimba told the afp news agency he would contest them .
" there were irregularities at every polling station , " he said .
" i will submit a complaint to the central election commission and will also go to court . "
bagapsh , meanwhile , vowed to strengthen relations with moscow , and expressed hope that the two could realize a number of joint economic initiatives , including a possible gas pipeline that would run under the black sea from russia to abkahazia .

before his departure from the un headquarters in new york , ban issued a warning that negotiators faced a race against time .
" i appeal to -lrb- negotiators -rrb- to redouble their efforts to find the room for compromise to make a final push in this final stretch , " ban said .
" if everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute , we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all , and this would be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequence , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .

setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .

the arrests came amid warnings from the un that time for a climate change deal is running out . danish police arrested 210 demonstrators in the christiania squat in copenhagen , a refuge for hippies and artists since the 1970s .
police said the protesters had set alight barricades and some had thrown petrol bombs as officers tried to put out the fires .
large numbers of climate protesters had been at the squat for a party on monday night .
a witness told danish television that police had blocked all the exits from the refuge and had then fired tear gas .
earlier in the day , 17 people were arrested at a rally to highlight the plight of climate refugees .
the majority of those detained have since been released .
the arrests follow the mass detention of about 900 protesters at the weekend during which danish police were accused of using heavy-handed measures .

after flying into the danish capital , ban told news agency associated press that rich and poor countries must " stop pointing fingers " and said countries have to look at what else they can do .
before his departure from the un headquarters in new york , ban issued a warning that negotiators faced a race against time .
" i appeal to -lrb- negotiators -rrb- to redouble their efforts to find the room for compromise to make a final push in this final stretch , " ban said .
" if everything is left to leaders to resolve at the last minute , we risk having a weak deal or no deal at all , and this would be a failure of potentially catastrophic consequence , " he added .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .

the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

the costs - 15.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- - were up 4 percent from 2007 .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .
some developing nations say handing over control on those issues to the developed world would smack of neo-colonialism. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 15.12.2009 poster designers added color to eastern europe 's velvet revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing on the wall at prague 's wenceslas square in 1989 two decades have passed since czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution .
the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while some believe it will make internet transactions more secure , others fear the information could be misused . the interior ministry has confirmed that the introduction of the multi-function card will go ahead as planned on november 1 , 2010 .
the information printed on the credit-card sized id will be encrypted digitally .
the radio chip also contains a digital passport photo .
enthusiastic advocate " i will be getting a new id card as soon as possible because it simply fits into my wallet a lot more easily , " said interior minister thomas de maiziere .

the card can also be used in machines , for example for age verification in cigarette vending machines .
restricted access but although the id can be used to fulfill both official and commercial functions , not everyone will have access to all of the data contained on the card .
owners have to enter a 6-digit pin number authorizing the release of information .
" citizens decide which data they want to transmit , " said interior ministry executive secretary hans bernhard beus . former interior minister wolfgang schaeuble had originally called for fingerprints to be made an obligatory feature of the new smart id cards , unleashing a storm of protest from data protectionists .

deputy finance minister filippos sachinidis last week confirmed that the country was more than 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- in the red , telling the parliament in athens it was the largest public debt in the country 's history .
a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .
" a difficult situation in one euro-area member state is a matter of common concern for the euro area as a whole , " he said. rb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .

for months , the german military establishment justified the attack as self-defence but more and more it seems as if the isaf forces in afghanistan specifically targeted taliban militants in kunduz .
the question , however , is whether german troops would have been justified to act offensively . the german bundeswehr is in afghanistan as part of the international security assistance force , or isaf .

sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .

sigmar gabriel , the head of germany ’ s social democratic party , the spd , who has been calling for the resignation of the current defence minister karl-theodor zu guttenberg over the kunduz affair wants the answer to a very specific question : “ whether it is true that there was a change of strategy to include the targeted killing of taliban leaders without there being a specific danger to the bundeswehr or its work .
and if this is the case , then who ordered the change of strategy and who knew about it ? ”
deadly violence in self-defence only ?
for years , the bundeswehr imposed limits on itself .
deadly violence was only to be used if german soldiers were attacked or at direct risk of attack .
in the summer , german troops were coming under increasing attack by insurgents and the defence ministry lifted the limits .
soldiers are now told explicitly that they can go on the offensive against people or groups that are planning or supporting attacks .
german troops killed some 20 taliban fighters during an offensive in kunduz province in july .
furthermore , german troops have been deployed in quick reaction forces since july 2008 and these never acted purely in self-defence .
soldiers have to be able to fight lieutenant colonel gunnar brügner - the first quick reaction forces commander - made it clear what was expected from the very beginning : “ each soldier who goes to afghanistan has to be in a position to fight . ”
“ we have to be capable of protecting , helping and mediating .
to find a balance between tasks at the bottom end of the intensity spectrum but also to make the jump to highly-intensive battles , to attacks and to deploying our own forces .
the whole range basically . ”
german reconnaissance tornados in mazar-i-sharif have also been engaged in more than self-defence for the past two and a half years .
the bundeswehr jets were initially deployed to protect isaf troops , as well as civilian aid workers and the afghan population .
but colonel thorsten poschwatta , who ran the tornado operation during its first months , said that this was not all : “ somehow the search for taliban is also a goal .
but we do not talk about the good ones but really about those who want to hinder the isaf operations , the reconstruction of the country .
so in that sense there ’ s nothing wrong . ”
a parliamentary committee will convene on wednesday to investigate if the attack in kunduz - whether an act of self-defence or a specific offensive against the taliban - was justified .

today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this .

the material damage was enormous : roads , bridges and houses were destroyed , fields were laid to waste and the annual harvest was destroyed .
the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .
they need to be able to protect themselves and have to deal with the after-effects .
the list of preventative measures is a long one : catastrophe committees , better communications infrastructures , early-warning systems and storage facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international aid agencies have a lot of convincing to do didier young , coordinator of the madagascan catastrophe aid for care international , said he supports the introduction of new rice varieties that ripen faster and can therefore be harvested up to two months before the cyclone season begins .
as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .
people who live in poverty generally have little incentive or time to worry about the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation increases devastation , such as flooding and landslides the average annual income of a madagascan is around 250 dollars .
according to the un , the island is one of the poorest and least developed in the world .
illegal lumbering and deforestation is a way for the islanders to survive ; the wood is used for cooking and heating . acute deforestation is now visible all over the island .
it increases the devastation caused by cyclones such as flooding , landslides and the aggradation of rice paddies .
without the forest 's natural barriers , the sand and debris flows into the irrigation channels and blocks them , topsoil from the fields is swept away , leaving them useless for growing .
when the wet season 's heavy rainfall comes , there is nothing to stop the water from flooding the valleys . author : barbara gruber editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the costs - 15.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- - were up 4 percent from 2007 .
the largest group to use the assistance comprises the handicapped , those in need of home medical care , and the elderly .
a look at hartz-iv in contrast to social assistance payments , welfare aid for those who are long-term unemployed is provided under germany 's hartz-iv unemployment package .
the hartz-iv system went into effect five years ago .
now , a study published on tuesday by the nuremberg-based institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- has shown that few people who get onto the hartz iv scheme are able to get off it again .
they often fail to return to a normal work life .
" people very seldom manage to get off of hartz iv , " the group wrote in its report , which is taking a look at the success of the program on its fifth anniversary .
the reform of the german labor market , which combined unemployment and social-assistance welfare , went into effect on january 1 , 2005 .
since then , iab has studying the effects of this change .
reassessing welfare reform ab director joachim moeller spoke of a " cautiously positive assessment of hartz iv , " saying overall the tendency was toward meeting the aims of the labor market reforms .
however , he said , there were still problems in dealing with the long-term unemployed .
according to the iab , the job-training schemes created so far are frequently not up to the task of solving the problem of long-term unemployment .
the famous " one-euro jobs " that were created to bring people back into the workplace should only be given to those who have been out of work for a long time , moeller said .
and single parents also need more assistance than they are currently getting - many fail to go back to work due to a lack of child care. jen / dpa / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.12.2009 german airlines call for independent regulator to set airport fees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german airports can charge what they want for their services the ongoing tussle between airlines and airports over fees came to a head last week when frankfurt airport announced a 12.5 percent price hike .
now the airlines are renewing calls for an independent regulator . against the background of an increasingly competitive airline industry , with both airlines and airports reporting a tough 2009 , the ongoing conflict over airport fees has become all too understandable .
airlines pay airports set fees for landing and taxiing their planes , and they are becoming increasingly disgruntled at being a captive customer .
last week the company that operates frankfurt airport , fraport , ignited fresh indignation by announcing it would raise fees by 12.5 percent .
mini monopolies now the german airline association -lrb- bdf -rrb- has called on the federal government to show some solomonic wisdom and create an independent federal regulator to arbitrate airport fees and to force airports to make savings where they can .
the bdf sees this as a necessary modernizing measure given the way the air travel business has evolved in the past 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has just announced a price hike " in the face of the critical economic situation it has become very important for airlines that their partners - those also involved in the air transport system - are positioned according to competitive criteria , " bdf spokeswoman sabine teller told deutsche welle .
" at the moment , every airport sets its own fees , and from our point of view that is a monopoly , " she said .
" the airports do nothing to keep the costs down , while airlines are under pressure to keep their prices as cheap as possible in order to get as many passengers as possible . "
the bdf also points to what it considers an absurdity in the current system in germany .
despite being by definition the most global of businesses , airlines in germany must go to regional state governments to have their airport fees regulated .
in almost all cases , the state governments actually own the airports .
" they therefore have an interest in raising profits from the airports .
that is a conflict of interests , " said teller .
a new federal network agency in the bdf 's vision , the proposed independent body would perform the same function as the german federal network agency does for the electricity , gas , telecommunications , postal and railway sectors - liberalizing the market to ensure competition .
" the comparison with railways is actually quite valid , " teller said .
" the rails and the railway stations belong to deutsche bahn , and they take a fee from railway companies to use them .
in this case , the federal network agency decides the extent of the fee . "
but the airports do not agree with this comparison .
" we do n't see airports as a business that can or should be deregulated like this . "
heike van hoorn , spokeswoman for the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" if you take the comparison of energy companies , for example - they operate power stations and the electricity network , " she said . "
in the air travel industry , it 's completely different .
we do n't have this monopoly situation .
the airports represent a point infrastructure , but the networks themselves are run by the airlines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparisons have been made with the railway industry on top of this , van hoorn was eager to point out that the adv alone represents 45 different airports .
" this is not a monopoly situation , " she said .
van hoorn argued that the current situation , whereby each airport 's fees are decided individually under the jurisdiction of the state government , has proven its efficiency .
" each airport plays an individual role in its local area , and state governments are much nearer , " she says .
political opportunity the bdf has timed its demand for an independent regulator with a certain political expediency .
the european union recently issued a new directive for airport fees , which member states must bring into effect within the next two years .
for the bdf , this is an ideal opportunity for reform .
" the eu airport fee directive expressly allows such a reform , " bdf boss michael engel said in a statement .
" and it would incidentally also bring clear advantages for state governments . "
according to the bdf , the savings would not only be financial , but also bureaucratic .
each application for permission to use an airport has to be processed individually - a task engel said some state governments were not able to complete efficiently .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

deputy finance minister filippos sachinidis last week confirmed that the country was more than 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- in the red , telling the parliament in athens it was the largest public debt in the country 's history .
a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .
" a difficult situation in one euro-area member state is a matter of common concern for the euro area as a whole , " he said. rb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .
he and a group of friends have planted 70,000 saplings in an area just north of the capital .
when the rainy season starts , the trees will be transplanted onto the dry dam embankments . the trees will form a natural barrier to stop the earth and debris sliding into the dam and blocking the power generators .
the state electricity board has agreed to provide fencing to protect the plantations .
it 's a smart step towards self-help in a country whose economy is two-thirds subsidized by foreign aid . at the beginning of the twentieth century , 40 percent of ethiopia was woodland .
but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .
newly planted seeds are washed away . " this can lead to the devastation of whole swathes of land , as it happened in the north for example , " said mekonen ayana from arba-minch university . water storage in ethiopia , environmentalism is largely a political matter . " it 's about irrigation projects and street building , land rights for farmers and forced re-settlement , " said argaw ashine , who heads an environmental radio project run by the german heinrich boell foundation .
" it is about multi-million pound aid programs and it 's about corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only six percent of the country has access to fresh water for the courageous 25-year-old , the country 's democratization process is happening too slowly .
he said it is obvious that the lack of environmental awareness is directly linked to poverty and educational deficits .
a free media that might help to create awareness does not exist . " development is good , but modern development has to take the environment into account to truly be sustainable , " said the head of the ethiopian environmental protection agency .
it 's a sound argument - except that only six percent of the country receives any water at all .
a working water storage system is not sufficiently developed , even at its source , the blue nile .
there is hardly any infrastructure in place to implement water-saving mechanisms . tadese has chosen to help himself .
the government has leased him half an acre of land east of addis ababa .

he also grows guavas , lemon , apples and corn .

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .

but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .

but it is also well known for its susceptibility to natural disasters .
every year , cyclones tear through the island . nosy varika lies on the south-east coast of madagascar , cut off from the rest of the island .
radio communication is the only contact the inhabitants have with the outside world .
there are no telephones and no communications networks .
even in the dry season , the area is difficult to reach and jeeps struggle on the potholed dirt tracks that have never seen a stroke of tarmac . in the rainy season , it is not even worth trying to get through .
the locals use the waterways to get around , travelling along the pangalanes canal in boats or in traditional pirogue canoes . along with the north of the island and the entire east coast , nosy varika is hit by cyclones nearly every year .
they are a matter of course ; only the names change every time : grettelle , indlala , jaya or dina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine in madagascar mostly affects children in january 2007 , the island was hit by cyclone clovis .
the material damage was enormous : roads , bridges and houses were destroyed , fields were laid to waste and the annual harvest was destroyed .
the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .
they need to be able to protect themselves and have to deal with the after-effects .
the list of preventative measures is a long one : catastrophe committees , better communications infrastructures , early-warning systems and storage facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international aid agencies have a lot of convincing to do didier young , coordinator of the madagascan catastrophe aid for care international , said he supports the introduction of new rice varieties that ripen faster and can therefore be harvested up to two months before the cyclone season begins .
as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .
people who live in poverty generally have little incentive or time to worry about the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation increases devastation , such as flooding and landslides the average annual income of a madagascan is around 250 dollars .
according to the un , the island is one of the poorest and least developed in the world .
illegal lumbering and deforestation is a way for the islanders to survive ; the wood is used for cooking and heating . acute deforestation is now visible all over the island .
it increases the devastation caused by cyclones such as flooding , landslides and the aggradation of rice paddies .
without the forest 's natural barriers , the sand and debris flows into the irrigation channels and blocks them , topsoil from the fields is swept away , leaving them useless for growing .
when the wet season 's heavy rainfall comes , there is nothing to stop the water from flooding the valleys . author : barbara gruber editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 15.12.2009 poster designers added color to eastern europe 's velvet revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing on the wall at prague 's wenceslas square in 1989 two decades have passed since czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution .
the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , he welcomed the greek premier ’ s call for austerity measures . the eu 's economic and monetary affairs commissioner joaquin almunia said on tuesday that greek prime minister george papandreou 's call for an austere budget and the restoration of the public finances was " a step in the right direction . "
" we take note of the greek government 's commitment , as reiterated yesterday evening by prime minister -lrb- george -rrb- papandreou , to cut public deficits and reduce government debt , ” almunia said .
however , he called on greece to come forward with concrete proposals on how to clean up its finances in the course of january .
on monday night , papandreou called on all citizens to participate in rebuilding the economy , saying the country had " lost every trace of credibility . "
over the next four years , greece would reduce its current deficit of 12.7 per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to less than 3 per cent , the prime minister said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : papandreou is under pressure to take concrete action to bring the deficit in line with eu rules that is the level to which eurozone governments are meant to keep , under the rules which created the single currency .
greece is a founder member of the eurozone , but its public finances have spiralled out of control in recent months , leading to fears of a default which could undermine the eu 's common currency .
deputy finance minister filippos sachinidis last week confirmed that the country was more than 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- in the red , telling the parliament in athens it was the largest public debt in the country 's history .
a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .
" a difficult situation in one euro-area member state is a matter of common concern for the euro area as a whole , " he said. rb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .

up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2009 germany 's new environment minister says copenhagen must succeed großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : norbert roettgen is acutely aware of the need for agreement in copenhagen norbert roettgen is currently attending climate talks in copenhagen .
in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .

setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .

it said that police detained the assailant .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .

no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .

" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .

on day nine , delegates have been urged to speed up negotiations . at the formal start of ministerial level talks at the 12-day conference the chairwoman and former danish climate minister , connie hedegaard , said tuesday that the united nations summit risks failure unless delegates enter into the spirit of compromise .
" success is still within reach .
but as -lrb- chairwoman -rrb- , i must also warn you : ' we can fail ' , " she said , holding out a stark warning as the final phase of negotiations began .
" we ca n't risk failure .
no one here can carry that responsibility .
that means that the key word for the next two days must be compromise , " hedegaard added .
un chief 's plea in an effort to press home the urgency of the issue , un secretary general ban ki-moon described the climate summit in copenhagen as a pivotal time in history .
he warned world leaders that the world has turned to them to " seal the deal . "
" this -lrb- is a -rrb- defining moment in history , " the un chief said tuesday .
" we have a chance , a real chance , to change the course of history . ”
" we know what we must do .
we know what the world expects , ” ban said , adding : “ our job here and now is to seal the deal , a deal in our common interest . "
ban said that he wanted to see " a deal that reduces greenhouse-gas emissions , that protects the most vulnerable , that ushers in a new era of clean development and green growth for all . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : time is not just running out for polar bears targets for reductions in emissions had to be more ambitious and finance was central to any agreement , he said , touching upon some of the key divisive issues .
" financing will be key , particularly in helping the poorest countries , " he added .
ban was among the dignitaries addressing nearly 200 national delegations at a ceremony marking the start of high-level talks among environment ministers .
so far , discussions aimed at slowing global warming had been conducted by bureaucrats .
merkel voices concern german chancellor angela merkel has also voiced concern about the pace of climate talks in copenhagen and prospects of success .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement , highlighting the deep divisions between rich and poor nations at the climate summit .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin on tuesday .

after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
crucial issues still unresolved with less than four days left before the end of the marathon conference , and the most crucial issues still unresolved , officials urged the parties to set their differences aside and work for an ambitious deal .
un 's climate chief , yvo de boer , said that " there is still an enormous amount of work and ground that needs to be covered . "
while emission targets and financial aid to poorer nations are still two of the biggest obstacles to an ambitious political deal , there are several other fault lines too .
the questions of who should manage and hand out the billions of dollars of aid money that poor nations need in order to mitigate and adapt to global warming as well as how to verify and enforce emissions targets set by developing countries are among sticky issues .

but the european union and the us have refused to recognize the breakaway region ’ s election . the united states and the european union have refused recognition of election results recently released in the breakaway caucasus region of abkhazia .
the us state department said it did not recognize the legality of the result , which saw separatist leader sergei bagapsh win re-election in the region 's first vote since it declared independence from georgia following tbilisi 's brief war with russia in august last year .
" the united states regrets the decision to hold ' elections ' in the abkhazia region of georgia on december 12 and recognizes neither the legality nor the results , " state department spokesman ian kelly said in a statement .
" the united states reiterates its support for georgia 's sovereignty and territorial integrity within its internationally recognized borders , " kelly said .
in a similar attack on the poll 's legitimacy , the european union said it " does not recognize the constitutional and legal framework within which these elections have taken place .
" the european union continues to support georgia 's territorial integrity and sovereignty , as recognized by international law , " added a statement by the eu presidency , which sweden holds until the end of the year .
limited support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia flooded abkhazia with military during the war with georgia the first official results , released by abkahazia 's election commission on sunday , reported that bagapsh had taken 59.4 percent of saturday 's vote and his main challenger raul khajimba had taken 15.4 percent .
if these results are confirmed , bagapsh would win the vote outright , without the need for a run-off .
the final results are expected to be released later this week , though khajimba told the afp news agency he would contest them .
" there were irregularities at every polling station , " he said .
" i will submit a complaint to the central election commission and will also go to court . "
bagapsh , meanwhile , vowed to strengthen relations with moscow , and expressed hope that the two could realize a number of joint economic initiatives , including a possible gas pipeline that would run under the black sea from russia to abkahazia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de trade -pipe- 15.12.2009 eu banana dispute ends in favor of latin american exporters großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the end of the 16-year banana dispute could mean cheaper bananas for europeans bananas will likely be a few cents cheaper for european shoppers as a result of the settlement of the ' banana war ' between latin american banana exporters and the eu . the longest trade dispute between the european union and latin american countries at the world trade organization -lrb- wto -rrb- was settled on tuesday .
since 1993 , the eu had discriminated against latin american growers , favoring bananas from former european colonies in africa , the caribbean and the pacific - a bloc known as the acp states .
the so-called " banana dispute " focused on the import tariffs on bananas and other tropical fruits that the eu had imposed on latin american banana imports , while fruit from former european colonies in acp countries came to europe tariff-free .
the european union confirmed on tuesday that it had clinched a deal with latin american countries to end a long-running trade war over banana tariffs .
big producers have most to gain " in the deal ... the eu will gradually cut its import tariff on bananas from latin america from 176 euros per ton to 114 euros -lrb- $ 255 to $ 165 -rrb- , " the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , said .
" the eu has also offered to mobilize up to 200 million euros for the main african and caribbean banana-exporting countries to help them adjust to stiffer competition from latin america , " it said .
these eu funds should be distributed over several years and mitigate the negative consequences for small farmers in the former colonies .
us-based companies like chiquita , dole and del monte , with the largest plantations in latin america , have the most to gain from the settled dispute .
last year the eu imported bananas with a total value of approximately 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.4 billion -rrb- .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wto director general pascal lamy welcomed the settlement " this has been one of the most technically complex , politically sensitive and commercially meaningful legal disputes ever brought to the wto , " world trade organization director general pascal lamy said . " it has also been one of the longest running ' sagas ' in the history of the post-world war ii multilateral trading system . "
" this proves that there is no trade issue which lies beyond the reach of wto members , " lamy added .
loss of protection ?
but mep sven giegold with the greens criticized the working conditions in latin america 's large-scale plantations .
human rights and environmental standards , he said , are often abused by these large multinational corporations .
" no , we 're not happy with it because our preference was always to maintain the tariff levels in order to provide some protection for small farmers , " giegold said .
the deal is likely to reduce prices for consumers in europe , increase competition in the banana market and strengthen the latin american position as low-cost exporters .
according to ecuadorian delegates at the talks , full signatures would take place about four months after the document was initialled on tuesday when all sides complete their respective national legislative processes. sjt / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the news comes as the controversial director awaits possible extradition to the us . organizers said on tuesday that the polish-french filmmaker 's new movie , “ the ghost writer , ” would feature at the 60th edition of the berlin film festival scheduled to be held in the german capital from february 11 to 21 .
the oscar-winning director of " chinatown " is confined to a swiss chalet after being detained in september when he arrived in switzerland to collect an award at the zurich film festival .
us prosecutors have been trying to extradite the franco-polish polanski , 76 , since 1978 when he fled the country before he could be sentenced after admitting having unlawful sex with a 13-year-old girl .
the director , who has french nationality , is fighting his extradition to the united states .
he was recently granted bail on condition that he surrender his passport and wear an electronic cuff .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polanski 's house arrest in this swiss chalet has attracted enormous media attention swiss authorities have warned polanski , who spent several weeks in jail , that he would forfeit his bail if he leaves his alpine chalet , and interpol has placed neighboring countries on alert in case he tries to flee .
working in detention polanski has reportedly been furiously editing " the ghost writer , " first in jail and then in his gstaad chalet in order to have it ready in time for its maiden public screening during at the berlin festival .
the film is based on the novel " the ghost " by british writer robert harris and stars pierce brosnan and ewan mcgregor .
it sees mcgregor assigned to pen the autobiography of a former british prime minister modelled on tony blair who then goes on to uncover dark secrets .
it also features pierce brosnan .
however , it seems unlikely that polanksi will make an appearance on the red carpet .
last week , his lawyers urged a california appeals court to dismiss his conviction , citing alleged misconduct by the trial judge , who died in 1993 , in the case .
but the prosecution argued that he has to appear in court himself to argue to have the case dropped .
interesting mix bildunterschrift : organizers hope the mix of styles and genres will improve berlinale 's image alongside " the ghost writer , " martin scorsese 's " shutter island " starring leonardo dicaprio will also receive its world premiere in berlin , albeit out of competition , organizers said .
it 's a horror film set in 1954 about the disappearance of a patient from a massachusetts hospital for the criminally insane .
others vying for the coveted golden bear award include " na putu " -lrb- " on the path " -rrb- by bosnian director jasmila zbanic and " bal " -lrb- " honey " -rrb- by turkey 's semih kaplanoglu .
also among the line-up announced on tuesday is german-iranian production “ shekarchi ” -lrb- the hunter -rrb- and " my name is khan " starring bollywood heartthrob shah rukh. rb / afp / dpa editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview , the politician , who only recently took office , stressed that the failure of the summit was " not an option . " the christian democrat underlined the need for ambitious targets if the world is to have a chance of slowing global warming .
but the task of cutting emissions should not merely be viewed as a costly exercise .
instead , norbert roettgen says that industry should recognize the huge economic potential of developing green technologies .
copenhagen is , according to the new environment minister , the most important economic conference of our age .
german public broadcaster deutschlandfunk spoke with the minister .
deutschlandfunk : what has to come out of the talks for you to be able to describe them as a success ?
norbert roettgen : something has to come from them .
failure is not an option .
what is imperative is that we need to agree that global warming has to be limited to two degrees between now and 2050 .
that goal will allow us to be relatively certain that the dramatic results of climate change will not occur .
and we need to take certain measures to achieve that .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : significant cuts in co2 are imperative that means we have to cut global co2 emissions by 50 percent .
industrialized countries have to do far more .
they will have to achieve more or lesss a net zero carbon footprint .
financial pledges to developing countries are part of that .
that costs money , but not doing anything would be much , much more expensive .
we all have to be part of this treaty , every country .
not like kyoto , which was n't ratified by the united states .
china and the us have to be part of this because they are responsible for 40 percent of co2 emissions .
and the die have to be cast on all these matters now in copenhagen in december .
and within six months , we have to formulate these concrete decisions in a legally binding treaty , which also contains a supervisory mechanism for the instruments , goals and measures . to what extent are concrete figures for achieving a reduction of greenhouse gases by 2020 important ?
the european union has certain ideas , the us has different ones and some countries do n't want to make any commitments at all in this respect .
these figures are important because we know that ecosystems do not respond quickly .
the goal has to be achieved by 2050 , but you can not achieve that if you start ten years prior to that .
that is why we have to start now and we have to take interim measurements between now and 2050 .
and 2020 is a deadline by which we have to have achieved the first goals .
the german government has committed itself to cutting co2 by 40 percent independently of the actions of other countries .
the european union is saying it will definitely cut 20 percent - if the others budge , it will increase this to 30 percent .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german chancellor merkel -lrb- l -rrb- and us president obama are to attend the summit in copenhagen the united states has not gotten this far , but it has changed direction .
up to now , the us had been producing more and more emissions .
now they have committed themselves to reducing them .
admittedly , their cuts are not yet as large as europeans and the international community deem necessary , or as much as the europeans are already doing .
but you also have to recognize that the united states is ten years behind .
in george w. bush 's administration , this subject did not play any role , to put it mildly .
the us has now started moving in this direction and they say that they will have reached this goal by 2050 .
they say they will speed up .
but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

but they will have to get things moving a bit . industry is traditionally not very enthusiastic when germany takes a lead in environmental protection .
up to now , you were seen as having the interests of industry at heart .
at one point in the past you wanted to become the head of the federation of german industries .
how can you now embark on a collision course with industry and how far will you go ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : green projects can generate money as well as energy this is not about conflict , but about the shared recognition of politics and business in germany that climate protection , when viewed from an economic point of view , is , at heart , about economic modernization and vital technological innovation . we have a growing global market in environmental services and environmental products .
we are a world leader with a 16-percent share of the market in environmental technologies .
we will only retain this position if we recognize that it is the market of the future and the leading innovation of the 21st century .
we will only secure our prosperity and remain the world "s number one exporter if we offer the most cutting-edge products in modern markets and not the markets of the past .
and that is why an economic competition for growth markets , for technological supremacy , is already taking place and is developing a stronger and stronger dynamic .
that is why i have said in the past and i will say again that copenhagen is the most important economic conference of our age .
it is about achieving equal competition conditions and it is about new markets , new technologies and our role in these markets .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

but it is also well known for its susceptibility to natural disasters .
every year , cyclones tear through the island . nosy varika lies on the south-east coast of madagascar , cut off from the rest of the island .
radio communication is the only contact the inhabitants have with the outside world .
there are no telephones and no communications networks .
even in the dry season , the area is difficult to reach and jeeps struggle on the potholed dirt tracks that have never seen a stroke of tarmac . in the rainy season , it is not even worth trying to get through .
the locals use the waterways to get around , travelling along the pangalanes canal in boats or in traditional pirogue canoes . along with the north of the island and the entire east coast , nosy varika is hit by cyclones nearly every year .
they are a matter of course ; only the names change every time : grettelle , indlala , jaya or dina . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poverty and famine in madagascar mostly affects children in january 2007 , the island was hit by cyclone clovis .
the material damage was enormous : roads , bridges and houses were destroyed , fields were laid to waste and the annual harvest was destroyed .
the people in the affected areas can face an immediate threat of famine in the storm 's aftermath . " they are forced to eat roots or whatever they can find to survive , " said madame caroline from german agro action , the only aid agency in the region . helping people help themselves in remote rural areas like nosy varika , inhabitants can not rely on outside help to cope with the cyclones .
they need to be able to protect themselves and have to deal with the after-effects .
the list of preventative measures is a long one : catastrophe committees , better communications infrastructures , early-warning systems and storage facilities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : international aid agencies have a lot of convincing to do didier young , coordinator of the madagascan catastrophe aid for care international , said he supports the introduction of new rice varieties that ripen faster and can therefore be harvested up to two months before the cyclone season begins .
as an added benefit , this would stop the annual flooding of the rice paddies during the rainy season , he said . it is not the ideas or initiatives that are lacking , but finding a way to turn them into a reality .
the international aid agencies first have to convince the madagascans of their ideas , which has proven a difficult process . madagascans are a highly traditional people .
their culture revolves around ancestor worship - a practice based on the belief that deceased family members have the ability to influence the fortunes of the living .
because of this , many things are " fady , " which means they are forbidden .
for example , new rice varieties are ignored because these have not been handed down by madagascan ancestors . deforestation with fatal consequences another obstacle in the way of change is the extreme poverty on the island .
three-quarters of the 18 million madagascans live on less than a dollar a day , and do n't have enough to eat .
people who live in poverty generally have little incentive or time to worry about the environment . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deforestation increases devastation , such as flooding and landslides the average annual income of a madagascan is around 250 dollars .
according to the un , the island is one of the poorest and least developed in the world .
illegal lumbering and deforestation is a way for the islanders to survive ; the wood is used for cooking and heating . acute deforestation is now visible all over the island .
it increases the devastation caused by cyclones such as flooding , landslides and the aggradation of rice paddies .
without the forest 's natural barriers , the sand and debris flows into the irrigation channels and blocks them , topsoil from the fields is swept away , leaving them useless for growing .
when the wet season 's heavy rainfall comes , there is nothing to stop the water from flooding the valleys . author : barbara gruber editor : sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the country 's droughts have not gone away .
they continue to take hundreds of thousand of lives . nearly 11 million people lived in the horn of africa around 1900 .
today , the number of inhabitants in ethiopia has reached roughly 90 million in an area about three times the size of germany . " so of course we have to find a way to produce more food for the people , " the farmers said .
according to a project leader from the german society for technical cooperation -lrb- gtz -rrb- , ethiopians have to find a way to use their water resources more effectively in order to do this . " there is enough water in the country , " the project leader said . but figures by the ethiopian government show that 2.7 million people in the eastern lowlands and in the south suffer from extreme drought and famine - despite the fact that there are 12 large rivers in ethiopia . the urgent need for sustainable solutions the idea that social and environmental change has to come from society itself is widespread in educated circles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is also fertile land in ethiopia " that which man can destroy , he can - at least in part - also repair , " said engineer tsegawbezu teketel at his office in addis ababa .
he and a group of friends have planted 70,000 saplings in an area just north of the capital .
when the rainy season starts , the trees will be transplanted onto the dry dam embankments . the trees will form a natural barrier to stop the earth and debris sliding into the dam and blocking the power generators .
the state electricity board has agreed to provide fencing to protect the plantations .
it 's a smart step towards self-help in a country whose economy is two-thirds subsidized by foreign aid . at the beginning of the twentieth century , 40 percent of ethiopia was woodland .
but most of the people use wood for cooking , heating and home building , leaving only 10 percent of the country 's forests remaining .
this excessive deforestation has robbed the landscape of its natural barriers .
there is no longer any protection against soil erosion and the resulting flash floods caused by heavy rainfall .
newly planted seeds are washed away . " this can lead to the devastation of whole swathes of land , as it happened in the north for example , " said mekonen ayana from arba-minch university . water storage in ethiopia , environmentalism is largely a political matter . " it 's about irrigation projects and street building , land rights for farmers and forced re-settlement , " said argaw ashine , who heads an environmental radio project run by the german heinrich boell foundation .
" it is about multi-million pound aid programs and it 's about corruption . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only six percent of the country has access to fresh water for the courageous 25-year-old , the country 's democratization process is happening too slowly .
he said it is obvious that the lack of environmental awareness is directly linked to poverty and educational deficits .
a free media that might help to create awareness does not exist . " development is good , but modern development has to take the environment into account to truly be sustainable , " said the head of the ethiopian environmental protection agency .

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

"
but he stressed agreement could not just be railroaded through .
" this process is not about ramming the interests of the few down the throats of many .
there are 400 million people in india who do n't have access to electricity .
how can you turn off the lightbulb you do n't have ? , " he asked .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .

akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de design -pipe- 15.12.2009 poster designers added color to eastern europe 's velvet revolution großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the writing on the wall at prague 's wenceslas square in 1989 two decades have passed since czechoslovakia 's velvet revolution .
the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .
but many of the most significant ones have now been persevered for posterity . author : ian willoughby -lrb- tw -rrb- editor : kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 15.12.2009 two killed in kurdish protest in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there have been frequent protests in kurdish dominated regions of turkey in recent days two kurds were reportedly shot dead and several others wounded in southeastern turkey when a shopkeeper fired on demonstrators protesting a court ban on the country 's main kurdish party . ziya akkaya , the mayor of the town of bulanik in the mainly kurdish province of mus , said on tuesday that the gunman , who was armed with an assault rifle , opened fire on a crowd holding a protest march in the town , denouncing the banning of the democratic society party -lrb- dtp -rrb- last week .
akkaya initially told the ntv news channel that " seven or eight people " were wounded in the incident , but brought the number down to six in a later broadcast .
the shooting came after the protestors stoned shops and banks along the route of the march and harassed shopkeepers who had not closed their stores in protest at the ban on the dtp , according to media reports .
anatolia news agency said the windows of the gunman 's shop were broken and his vehicle torched by the protestors .
it said that police detained the assailant .
television footage showed a crowd of several hundred people marching through the town and some pelting an armored police vehicle with stones .
ban triggered protests tuesday 's fatalities were the first after days of violence and street protests following a turkish constitutional court ruling on friday to ban the only kurdish party in parliament .
there have been daily protests in the kurdish-populated southeast and east of the country as well as major western towns with large numbers of kurdish migrants since the court ruling .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmet turk , chairman of the pro-kurdish dtp , left , and lawmaker aysel tugluk , said their lawmakers would boycott parliament the court said the dtp had become a " focal point of activities against the indivisible unity of the state , the country and the nation " through its links to kurdish rebels waging a 25-year insurgency for self rule in the southeast .
setback for integration drive , eu hopes the ban undermined a government drive , launched in august , to expand the rights of turkey 's estimated 12 million kurds in the hope of ending the armed campaign by the outlawed kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- .
some analysts say the danger is that the ban on the dtp will further alienate kurds , and could fan support for militants .
the court decision was criticised by prime minister tayyip erdogan , whose government is trying to end a 25-year-old conflict that has killed 40,000 people .
the court ruling is also seen as a setback for turkey ' faltering hopes of joining the european union .
the european commission this week warned that the ruling deprived voters of the political representation needed for turkey to fulfil its democratic mandate. rb / afp / reuters editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

others have been striking a similar chord on day nine . merkel urged developed and developing nations to make a " constructive contribution " to an agreement .
the crucial conference in the danish capital , which is due to end friday , has been marked by deep divisions between rich and poor nations .
" we know that time is running out , " the german chancellor told reporters after talks with indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono in berlin .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel , right , discusses climate change with indonesian president yudhoyono merkel , who says germany will commit to reducing greenhouse emissions by 30 percent from 1990 levels by 2020 or even 40 percent if others agree to steep cuts , will be in copenhagen with world leaders for the last two days on thursday and friday .
" i will not hide the fact that i am somewhat nervous whether we will manage to achieve everything , " she said when asked about her hopes for reaching a deal by the end of the week on curbing co2 output and slowing global warming .
after meeting with merkel , yudhoyono called for developing countries to increase their pledges .
" i am convinced that the developing countries must give more and do more to jointly achieve the international targets , " he said .
dragging their feet earlier , the conference chair , denmark 's former climate minister connie hedegaard , said that negotiations would go down to the wire , comparing the delegates to work-shy pupils .
" if they have a very long deadline to deliver an exercise , they will wait for the last moment , " she said .
" only when you know that the deadline is there and you can not escape it , then you have to do it , " hedegaard told a press conference .

the communist regime has disappeared , but many of the posters instrumental in the campaign for change have been brought back to life in a book . prague 's wenceslas square has been a focal point of protest at various times in czech history , and the weeks of the 1989 velvet revolution were no exception .
posters calling for " free elections " and " havel to the castle " were plastered to every surface .
many of them were the work of leading designers . " it was just a wave of creation , of people 's art .
it was amazing , a flood , from very simple things to very sophisticated poetry , " jan bubenik , then student leader of the revolution , told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " back to europe " now graphic designer filip blazek has captured some of that wave of creation in a new book entitled " posters of the velvet revolution . "
and as he told deutsche welle , there was plenty to choose from . " prague was absolutely ' over-postered ' at that time .
you could see posters outside buildings , inside buildings , on windows , on public transport , " he said . scratchy beginnings many of the very first posters were created by students such as bubenik .
they may have been hand-written and a bit crude , but they were the product of creative and dedicated young minds . " after we took over the medical school and had an occupational strike , we had a full department which was only focused on making posters , " said bubenik . it was n't long before professionally printed posters began to appear alongside the home-made ones .
produced in runs of up to two million , these are the works which feature in filip blazek 's new book - and he had a hand in making many of them himself . although he was only 15 years old in 1989 , he would travel after school to a gallery in prague which was a hotbed of revolutionary activity . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " havel to the castle " " the manes exhibition hall was headquarters of the artists or designers organisation , " blazek said , adding that it was logical for them to team up with the organizers of the protest movement . leading lights among those who chose a theme to illustrate were frantisek skala , today a leading czech visual artist , and ales najbrt , who heads one of the country 's most highly regarded design studios .
the posters they and others produced often featured little more than slogans such as " end one-party rule ! " and " back to europe . " many were in red , white and blue , the czech colors , and a good number bore the logo of civic forum , the loose opposition group that led the country to free elections .
blazek said the quality varied , but - given the times - artistic merit was not the main issue . " i think what is most important for me is that the designers did a great job , " he said .
" they expressed ideas of freedom , ideas of humanity , ideas of free elections - and this is not what their schools had prepared them for . " one particularly common poster featured a photo of then playwright vaclav havel with the slogan " havel for president . "
by the end of 1989 , that call had become reality and blazek believes the posters contributed to that success - not least because havel was relatively unknown outside prague and other major cities . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " end one-party rule " " because he looked good on the poster , " blazek said , " people started to like or even adore him .
it was a very important part of his election campaign . " once havel took up the presidential reins on december 29 , 1989 , the velvet revolution was effectively over and the posters started to disappear from walls and buildings .

the costs - 15.2 billion euros -lrb- $ 22 billion -rrb- - were up 4 percent from 2007 .
the largest group to use the assistance comprises the handicapped , those in need of home medical care , and the elderly .
a look at hartz-iv in contrast to social assistance payments , welfare aid for those who are long-term unemployed is provided under germany 's hartz-iv unemployment package .
the hartz-iv system went into effect five years ago .
now , a study published on tuesday by the nuremberg-based institute for employment research -lrb- iab -rrb- has shown that few people who get onto the hartz iv scheme are able to get off it again .
they often fail to return to a normal work life .
" people very seldom manage to get off of hartz iv , " the group wrote in its report , which is taking a look at the success of the program on its fifth anniversary .
the reform of the german labor market , which combined unemployment and social-assistance welfare , went into effect on january 1 , 2005 .
since then , iab has studying the effects of this change .
reassessing welfare reform ab director joachim moeller spoke of a " cautiously positive assessment of hartz iv , " saying overall the tendency was toward meeting the aims of the labor market reforms .
however , he said , there were still problems in dealing with the long-term unemployed .
according to the iab , the job-training schemes created so far are frequently not up to the task of solving the problem of long-term unemployment .
the famous " one-euro jobs " that were created to bring people back into the workplace should only be given to those who have been out of work for a long time , moeller said .
and single parents also need more assistance than they are currently getting - many fail to go back to work due to a lack of child care. jen / dpa / kna editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 15.12.2009 german airlines call for independent regulator to set airport fees großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german airports can charge what they want for their services the ongoing tussle between airlines and airports over fees came to a head last week when frankfurt airport announced a 12.5 percent price hike .
now the airlines are renewing calls for an independent regulator . against the background of an increasingly competitive airline industry , with both airlines and airports reporting a tough 2009 , the ongoing conflict over airport fees has become all too understandable .
airlines pay airports set fees for landing and taxiing their planes , and they are becoming increasingly disgruntled at being a captive customer .
last week the company that operates frankfurt airport , fraport , ignited fresh indignation by announcing it would raise fees by 12.5 percent .
mini monopolies now the german airline association -lrb- bdf -rrb- has called on the federal government to show some solomonic wisdom and create an independent federal regulator to arbitrate airport fees and to force airports to make savings where they can .
the bdf sees this as a necessary modernizing measure given the way the air travel business has evolved in the past 20 years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frankfurt airport has just announced a price hike " in the face of the critical economic situation it has become very important for airlines that their partners - those also involved in the air transport system - are positioned according to competitive criteria , " bdf spokeswoman sabine teller told deutsche welle .
" at the moment , every airport sets its own fees , and from our point of view that is a monopoly , " she said .
" the airports do nothing to keep the costs down , while airlines are under pressure to keep their prices as cheap as possible in order to get as many passengers as possible . "
the bdf also points to what it considers an absurdity in the current system in germany .
despite being by definition the most global of businesses , airlines in germany must go to regional state governments to have their airport fees regulated .
in almost all cases , the state governments actually own the airports .
" they therefore have an interest in raising profits from the airports .
that is a conflict of interests , " said teller .
a new federal network agency in the bdf 's vision , the proposed independent body would perform the same function as the german federal network agency does for the electricity , gas , telecommunications , postal and railway sectors - liberalizing the market to ensure competition .
" the comparison with railways is actually quite valid , " teller said .
" the rails and the railway stations belong to deutsche bahn , and they take a fee from railway companies to use them .
in this case , the federal network agency decides the extent of the fee . "
but the airports do not agree with this comparison .
" we do n't see airports as a business that can or should be deregulated like this . "
heike van hoorn , spokeswoman for the german airport association -lrb- adv -rrb- , told deutsche welle .
" if you take the comparison of energy companies , for example - they operate power stations and the electricity network , " she said . "
in the air travel industry , it 's completely different .
we do n't have this monopoly situation .
the airports represent a point infrastructure , but the networks themselves are run by the airlines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : comparisons have been made with the railway industry on top of this , van hoorn was eager to point out that the adv alone represents 45 different airports .
" this is not a monopoly situation , " she said .
van hoorn argued that the current situation , whereby each airport 's fees are decided individually under the jurisdiction of the state government , has proven its efficiency .
" each airport plays an individual role in its local area , and state governments are much nearer , " she says .
political opportunity the bdf has timed its demand for an independent regulator with a certain political expediency .
the european union recently issued a new directive for airport fees , which member states must bring into effect within the next two years .
for the bdf , this is an ideal opportunity for reform .
" the eu airport fee directive expressly allows such a reform , " bdf boss michael engel said in a statement .
" and it would incidentally also bring clear advantages for state governments . "
according to the bdf , the savings would not only be financial , but also bureaucratic .
each application for permission to use an airport has to be processed individually - a task engel said some state governments were not able to complete efficiently .

" we take note of the greek government 's commitment , as reiterated yesterday evening by prime minister -lrb- george -rrb- papandreou , to cut public deficits and reduce government debt , ” almunia said .

over the next four years , greece would reduce its current deficit of 12.7 per cent of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- to less than 3 per cent , the prime minister said .

greece is a founder member of the eurozone , but its public finances have spiralled out of control in recent months , leading to fears of a default which could undermine the eu 's common currency .
deputy finance minister filippos sachinidis last week confirmed that the country was more than 300 billion euros -lrb- $ 440 billion -rrb- in the red , telling the parliament in athens it was the largest public debt in the country 's history .
a week ago , almunia said in a statement that the commission would " continue to monitor the situation in greece very closely " in the hope of forestalling financial meltdown .
" a difficult situation in one euro-area member state is a matter of common concern for the euro area as a whole , " he said. rb / dpa / afp editor : trinity hartman send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
